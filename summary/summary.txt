British white paper on public health
From smoking bans to personal trainers, government unveils how it wants people to help themselves to live longer John Reid, the health secretary, yesterday championed personal choice over state dictation as he launched the government's wide-ranging blueprint for disease prevention ranging from smoking bans to personal health trainers, curbs on advertising junk food to children, and speedier access to sexual health clinics. The white paper on public health in England, Choosing Health, went further than some expected in restricting tobacco in public places - smoking at the bar will be illegal even in pubs where cigarettes are not banned - but the emphasis was on allowing individuals to make their own health choices, with NHS support where wanted. Food and advertising industries were also given the chance to respond to concerns about their part in tackling the obesity epidemic, while an industry-funded lobby group was left in control of health messages related to sensible drinking. The medical profession was disappointed but Mr Reid said: "In a free society, men and women ultimately have the right within the law to choose their own lifestyle, even when it may damage their own health. But people do not have the right to damage the health of others, or to impose an intolerable degree of inconvenience or nuisance to others. Justifying his decision not to implement a total smoking ban in public places, he said: "I am not a medical officer. I'm a politician charged with maintaining a free democratic society ... A lot of effort is about making sure that people who cannot afford personal trainers and lifestyle gurus - all those whose needs have been ignored for 60 years - are going to get their needs met." The mantra behind the white paper shifts public health approaches from "advice from on high to support from next door", and central to this is the appointment of NHS-accredited "health trainers" to whom people can turn for advice. These will at first be available only in the 20% of local primary care trusts with the worst healthy and deprivation profiles, but will later spread throughout England.

CBS fires four in fake Bush story fallout
Appoint a senior Standards and Practices Executive, reporting directly to the President of CBS News, who would review all investigative reporting, use of confidential sources and authentication of documents. Personnel should feel comfortable going to this person confidentially and without fear of reprisal, with questions or concerns about particular reports. Foster an atmosphere in which competitive pressure is not allowed to prompt airing of reports before all investigation and vetting is done. Allow senior management to know the names of confidential sources as well as all relevant background about the person needed to make news judgments. Appoint a separate team, led by someone not involved in the original reporting, to look into any news report that is challenged. In a memo to CBS News staff sent Monday afternoon, Heywood said it was a "difficult and important" day for CBS News. "It is an important day because it represents a unique opportunity for all of us at CBS News to learn from the mistakes surrounding the flawed 60 Minutes Wednesday segment and reaffirm our commitment to the American public to practice journalism of the highest standard,'' Heywood said. CBS News anchor Dan Rather announced in November that he is stepping down as anchor of The CBS Evening News in March, on the 24th anniversary of his first broadcast as anchor. The panel also said CBS News had compounded that failure with a "rigid and blind" defense of thereport.Asked to resign were Senior Vice President Betsy West, who supervised CBS News primetime programs;Executive Producer Josh Howard; and Howard's deputy, Senior Broadcast Producer Mary Murphy. "The combination of a newmanagement team, great deference given to a highly respected producer and the network's news anchor, competitive pressures, and a zealous belief in the truth of the segment seem to have led many to disregard some fundamental journalistic principles," the report said.The piece was aired during a tight and hotly contested presidential race between Mr. Bush and Democratic challenger Sen. John Kerry.

Nepal's King names new cabinet
The King of Nepal seized power yesterday when he sacked the government, put senior politicians under house arrest, declared a state of emergency and put the army on the streets. King Gyanendra promised to restore democracy and order after nearly 10 years of civil war between Maoist rebels and government forces. Speaking before phone lines were cut, diplomats in Kathmandu said armoured vehicles were patrolling the streets. It is the second time in two years that King Gyanendra has dismissed the prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, and the fourth time he has sacked a prime minister in less than three years. Nepal has had no parliament since 2002. The monarch's statement promised to "restore democracy and law and order in the country in the next three years". He defended the suspension of democracy and citizens' rights in the "larger interest of the Nepalese general public", adding that he would chair the new administration. Political analysts said the king seemed to be trying to return to the days when his family ran the country as feudal autocrats and living Hindu gods, before democracy arrived in 1990. Supporters of the palace say he has become frustrated by politicians' ceaseless infighting. In taking power he has shelved several provisions of the constitution, including the freedoms of press, speech and expression, the freedom to assemble peacefully, the right to privacy, and the right not to be held in preventive detention. Amnesty International said it was alarmed that the emergency could be used to justify the disappearance and summary execution of human rights activists, a trend that had become an ugly feature of the fighting in recent months. Mr Deuba told the Associated Press that politicians would "oppose this step", which "directly violates the constitution and is against democracy".

Suspect in BTK killings arrested after 25 years in hiding
Dennis Rader is listed as a municipal worker in Park City Dennis Rader was arrested without incident in Park City on Friday and is now suspected of committing 10 murders, police in nearby Wichita said. Charges are yet to be brought in the case, which had been thought to consist of eight murders from 1974 to 1986. "The bottom line: BTK is arrested," Police Chief Norman Williams told a news conference where he was applauded. The suspect's DNA has been linked to at least one murder, officials said. Tips from public BTK resurfaced last year when a claim was made for an eighth victim. SUSPECTED BTK VICTIMS Marine Hedge, 53 Delores "Dee" Davis, 62 Joseph Otero, 38, his wife, Julie, 34, and their two children Kathryn Bright, 21 Shirley Vian, 24 Nancy Fox, 25 Vicki Wegerle, 28 (pictured) Killer's reign of terror The Wichita Eagle newspaper received a letter in March enclosing photos and a copy of a driver's licence of Vicki Wegerle, whose 1986 murder was never solved. Families of BTK victims and Kansas government officials also attended Saturday's news conference where the arrest was announced. Additional victims Chief Williams said that work on the case had brought the victim toll to 10. The two additional victims were named as Marine Hedge, 53, and Delores "Dee" Davis, 62. Mayor Carlos Mayans said police had phoned him late on Friday evening to say the DNA of the suspect matched evidence gathered from the scene of at least one BTK murder. Most of the victims were women killed in their homes but the first murder attributed to the BTK killer was that of an entire family in January 1974: Joseph Otero, 38, his wife, Julie, 34, and their two children.

Green paper asks for the BBC's Board of Governors to be scrapped
The licence fee was "the fairest way to fund the BBC", Ms Jowell said The governors, whose dual role as regulator and cheerleader of the BBC has been criticised, would be replaced by a BBC Trust and an executive board. The proposals were announced by Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell with the publication of a Green Paper into the corporation's future. The licence fee would be kept for at least another 10 years, she said. The main plans in the Green Paper are: BBC governors to be abolished and a new trust established to "speak up" for the licence fee payer Licence fee to remain - but a review will examine other funding methods BBC told not to "play copycat" or "chase ratings for ratings sake" More programmes to be made by independent companies The governors' current role was "unsustainable" and lacked "clarity and accountability", Ms Jowell told the House of Commons. Instead, the BBC Trust would be the voice of the licence fee payer, make sure the corporation fulfilled its obligations and have powers to approve or veto budgets and strategies. Green Paper in full (1.275 MB) Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need to download Adobe Acrobat Reader. Download the reader here Explaining why she favoured keeping the licence fee, Ms Jowell said it retained "a high degree of public support". "And although not perfect, we believe it remains the fairest way to fund the BBC," she said. It would also examine whether public money, including licence fee funds, should be given to other broadcasters for public service activities. HOW LICENCE FEE IS SPENT Viewers pay £10 per month, which is spent in the following way: £5 - terrestrial TV £1 - digital £1.20 - radio £1.50 - local TV and radio £0.30 - Online £1 - transmission and collection of licence fee Staff campaign against cuts The public will be consulted on the Green Paper, with firmer recommendations set out in a White Paper due to be published in late 2005.

Bolivian Congress refuse president's resignation
Carlos Mesa has approval ratings of above 50% He offered to stand down on Monday, amid nationwide protests that he said had left Bolivia "ungovernable". Bolivia's indigenous majority had staged a series of roadblocks and protests against his economic policies. The vote came after a day of talks between Mr Mesa and Bolivia's main political parties. Two of the three main blocs agreed to support him, but the BBC's Elliot Gotkine says the refusal of the main opposition party, MAS, to sign up to the agreement could yet complicate matters. "I am willing to keep working with Congress," Mr Mesa told legislators after the vote, in a speech outlining a national "social pact". Today we have managed to bring the country closer together President Carlos Mesa Bolivan press relieved In pictures: Protest history A referendum on regional autonomy and a constituent assembly to define a new constitution would also be established, he said. The president called for ordinary Bolivians to take to the streets to show their opposition to roadblocks and protests. As the news emerged, the centre of Bolivia's capital, La Paz, saw thousands of Mr Mesa's supporters fill the streets as negotiations on the "social pact" continued late into the evening. Mr Mesa, a political independent, came to power in October 2003 when his predecessor, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, fled the country over nationwide protests in 2003 that left at least 60 people dead.

China enacts historic "anti-secession" law
Historic law enacted with popular support China enacted on Monday a law aimed at preventing Taiwan's secession from the country. It is hailed unanimously as a "powerful legal guarantee for peaceful national reunification" by lawmakers, government leaders and the general public. The NPC deputies, many beaming with smiles, applauded for nearly one minute upon the announcement of the vote outcome, broadcast live nationwide through state television, radio and major news websites. AM - Tuesday, 15 March , 2005 08:20:00 Reporter: John Shovelan TONY EASTLEY: China is becoming a growing diplomatic concern for the Bush administration. From Washington, John Shovelan reports the issue is one of several which will dominate the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's trip to China and the region this week. JOHN SHOVELAN: The passage of China's anti secession law, giving its military the legal basis to attack Taiwan if it moved toward independence occurred just a few days before the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrives in China on her first sweep though Asia. There's been little public focus on the US-Sino relationship post 9/11, but China's hardline stance on Taiwan has added aggravation to a growing list of issues between the US and the emerging Superpower. RICHARD BOUCHER: It runs counter to the relatively positive, the recent warming trends that we've seen in cross-strait relations. It only serves to harden positions. SCOTT MCCLELLAN: We do view the adoption of the anti-secession law as something that is unfortunate and not helpful to encouraging peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

Symbian licenses email technology from rival Microsoft
Symbian Ltd., maker of the top operating system for "smart" cell phones, is licensing e-mail technology from Microsoft Corp., an unexpected deal with a rival that may bolster Microsoft's bid to extend its dominance in computer software to mobile devices. The agreement will enable users of Symbian-based phones to automatically send and receive e-mail from accounts running on Microsoft's Exchange Server, a network platform popularly used by corporations to manage Microsoft's ubiquitous Outlook e-mail and calendar applications. Symbian, a joint venture formed by some of the world's best known phone makers, has emerged as the best-selling platform for advanced cell phones designed to double as both handheld computers and mobile entertainment centers. However, most of that success has come in European markets where lead investor Nokia Corp. is most influential. In North America and other markets, Symbian has gained only modest traction as compared with rival wireless platforms such as Palm and Windows Mobile from Microsoft. According to the research firm IDC, converged mobile devices accounted for only a few percent of the more than 600 million phones sold in 2004, but that number is expected to grow sharply this year. Dave Thompson, corporate vice president of the Exchange Server Product Group at Microsoft, said the accord gave both companies the opportunity to expand the number of customers who can access their e-mail and other data from wireless services as demand for such services grows rapidly.

Explosion at Texas refinery kills 14, injures more than 100
A massive explosion tore through America's third largest oil refinery last night, killing at least 14 people and leaving more than 100 injured. The blast happened at the western end of the BP plant in Texas City. The cause was unknown, although a BP spokeswoman said that terrorism was "not a primary focus of our investigation". Charles Gregory, who works at the refinery, said he and several colleagues were inside a trailer getting ready to clean the tank when the floor started rumbling. "After that is when it exploded," he said. "Have you ever heard the thunder real loud? Judith Mantrell, who was at home on Tiki Island about about five miles across Galveston Bay from the plant, said: "It was unbelievable, the flames shot more than 70 feet (21m) into the air." Ms Mantell, 62, told the Houston Chronicle there was a sharp and short boom that shook her home, rattled her windows and moved her truck inches across the ground. Daniel Horowitz, the director of public affairs for the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, confirmed last night that Federal investigators had been dispatched to the blast site. The plant, which is about 35 miles (56kms) south-east of Houston, sprawls across 1,200 acres (486 hectares) and has 30 refinery units.

Five dead, over 200 injured as looting continues in Bishkek
Opposition leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev emerged from the Parliament building Friday and said he has been named Kyrgyzstan's acting president and prime minister - a day after protesters drove President Askar Akayev's government from power and unleashed widespread looting. Both the United States and Russia have military bases near Bishkek, the capital of this strategically important Central Asian nation - sandwiched between China's northwest border and Russia's eastern border, with Afghanistan just one country away. Kyrgyzstan was annexed by Russia in 1864 and returned to independent status in 1991, with the breakup of the Soviet Union. The U.S. has 1,000 troops at its Krygyzstan base. Asked Thursday whether the situation poses a hazard to Americans, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said he does not believe U.S. forces will be harmed by the turmoil. In Washington Thursday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the upheaval in Kyrgyzstan could wind up a democratic success story if political change occurs without violence. "This is a process that's just beginning. We know where we want to go," Rice said. Russia meanwhile is saying it would not object if the ousted president, Akayev, wants to go to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin says the situation in Kyrgyzstan is the result of the authorities' weakness and the social and economic problems that had accumulated there. In Bishkek Friday, opposition leader Bakiyev addressed a crowd of about a thousand supporters in the city's central square, announcing his new status as the nation's acting leader and proclaiming: "Freedom has finally come to us." Bakiyev's appointment as acting president was endorsed by a newly restored parliament of lawmakers who held seats before the elections, which fueled protests against longtime leader Akayev and his government. Bakiyev urged opposition supporters not to allow looting, and stressed that the popular opposition figure Kulov would coordinate law enforcement. Bakiyev proposed that former Foreign Minister Roza Otunbayeva be named the country's top diplomat, and said, "All intergovernmental agreements will remain in full force and are in full effect."

U.S. willing to sell F-16s to Pakistan, India
The United States has dramatically shifted its arms sale policy toward South Asian rivals India and Pakistan by announcing F-16 fighter jet sales for Pakistan on Friday. (Xinhua/AFP/File) WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhuanet) -- The United States has dramatically shifted its arms sale policy toward South Asian rivals India and Pakistan by announcing F-16 fighter jet sales for Pakistan on Friday. According to White House spokeswoman Dana Perino, US President George W. Bush, on vacation at his Texas ranch, spoke by phone on Friday with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to explain his decision to sell F-16s to Pakistan. During the telephone talks, Singh expressed India's "great disappointment" at the US decision, the Indian leader's spokesman Sanjaya Baru said. US government officials, however, argued that the sale will notchange the overall balance of power between Pakistan and India. US State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said on Friday that the F-16s to be sold to Pakistan would be newly built but the number was still "undetermined." A senior US government official said earlier that the initial plan is to sell 24 to Pakistan. US officials on Friday also indicated a willingness to sell multirole warplanes to India if New Delhi chooses to buy them fromthe United States. Pakistan has been frustrated for years in its desire to buy newF-16s for its air force, which already has 32 older model F-16s. The US Congress canceled a sale of about two dozen F-16s to Pakistan in 1990 because of Islamabad's pursuit of nuclear weapons. The United States has dramatically shifted its arms sale policy toward South Asian rivals India and Pakistan by announcing F-16 fighter jet sales for Pakistan on Friday. The tensions between the two long-time South Asian rivals have also eased significantly since they began peace dialogues last year.

Doctor Who returns as UK Saturday night timeslot lord
The new Doctor Who is played by Christopher Eccleston The opening episode of the first full series since 1989 saw the Time Lord - played by Christopher Eccleston - meet his assistant Rose (Billie Piper). Written by Russell T Davies, it is the first of 13 new episodes of the drama, which was first screened in 1963. "We're pleased so many people sat down as a family to watch the return of the Doctor," a BBC spokesperson said. Unofficial overnight figures show the programme got an average of 9.9 million viewers - 43.2% of all viewers - with a peak of 10.5 million viewers, a 44.3% share of the audience. Warm reviews After saving Rose's life the Doctor blew up the department store in spectacular fashion - it was a pretty good beginning Sylvester McCoy Sylvester McCoy's review Doctor Who's comeback helped ramp up the usual Saturday ratings battle between BBC One and ITV1.

UN Secretary General Annan cleared of influencing oil-for-food contracts by Volcker report
I have this morning received from Mr. Paul Volcker and his colleagues the second interim report of their independent inquiry into allegations concerning the United Nations oil-for-food programme in Iraq. I thank them once again for their investigation. As I had always hoped and firmly believed, the Inquiry has cleared me of any wrongdoing. On the key issue of the award of the contract to inspect humanitarian goods entering Iraq under the oil-for-food programme, the report states clearly that "there is no evidence that the selection of Cotecna in 1998 was subject to any affirmative or improper influence of the Secretary-General in the bidding or selection process." I will meet the press later today to make a fuller statement on the findings contained in the report, and to answer questions. The position of the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, was undermined yesterday after an independent inquiry into the oil-for-food scandal heavily criticised his son Kojo and a Swiss company. Although Mr Annan was personally cleared of improper influence in the awarding of a contract to the Swiss company Cotecna, the committee of inquiry's findings about his son left question marks about his stewardship of the UN, which has come under increasing pressure. At a press conference yesterday, the chairman of the inquiry committee, Paul Volcker, said an investigation the secretary general had initiated was "inadequate" and should have been referred to the UN's independent watchdog agency. "As I had always hoped and firmly believed, the inquiry has cleared me of any wrong doing," he said. Asked if he would resign, he replied: "Hell, no." But the secretary general, who is due to retire next year at the end of two terms, could now find it difficult to push through his reform programme, and to pacify his critics. Norm Coleman,a Republican senator, said yesterday: "His lack of leadership, combined with conflicts of interest and a lack of responsibility and accountability point to one, and only one, outcome: his resignation."

China responds to US plan for import quotas
Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, April 5, 2005; Page A15 The Bush administration took a giant step yesterday toward imposing new caps on imports of Chinese clothing, responding to complaints that China's export juggernaut is starting to dominate the worldwide apparel market since the system governing the global industry was changed on Jan. 1. A U.S. interagency panel said it will initiate proceedings to determine whether new limits should be slapped on imports from China of underwear, cotton trousers, and cotton knit shirts and blouses. In a statement, Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez said the administration is committed "to providing assistance to our domestic textile and apparel industry consistent with our international rights and obligations." The move makes it highly likely that a much-anticipated flood of Chinese clothing into the U.S. and world markets will be deferred for a while -- at least for this year, and possibly several more. At year-end 2004, a three-decade-old system of quotas on international textile and apparel shipments expired, arousing widespread predictions that China's enormously efficient and low-cost clothing makers would devastate rival producers once limits were eliminated on individual countries' shipments. But under the terms of its entry into the World Trade Organization, Beijing agreed to allow the United States and other nations to impose "safeguard" caps on imports of Chinese textiles and apparel in the event that such imports rose so quickly as to "disrupt" those markets. The safeguards can limit the annual growth in Chinese imports to as little as 7.5 percent, and they can be used until 2008. Yesterday's announcement came as a huge relief to the U.S. textile industry, which has already suffered massive job losses in recent years, in part because of competition from low-cost manufacturing countries. It has beseeched the administration to take action as quickly as possible against the new threat posed by the Chinese. The European Union, another major market for clothing, is considering similar measures. The U.S. textile industry filed petitions last year seeking safeguards in a number of clothing categories, but those petitions have been tied up in court because they were based only on the potential menace that Chinese imports posed rather than clear evidence of an import surge. In yesterday's move, the administration "self-initiated" the safeguard process, citing preliminary data released last week that showed very sharp increases in many categories of Chinese imported clothing during the first quarter of 2005. Karl Spilhaus, president of the National Textile Association, said the administration's move "is very welcomed by American textile manufacturers who are struggling against a flood of imports from China."

51 suspects named by UN for war crimes in Darfur
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan(R) hands Luis Moreno Ocampo, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), a sealed envelop containing a list of 51 names of people blamed for war crimes in the conflict of Sudan's Darfur region. (Xinhua photo) ¡¡UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhuanet) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday handed Luis Moreno Ocampo, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), a sealed envelop containing a list of 51 names of people blamed for war crimes in the conflict of Sudan's Darfur region. "Now, we have a common task to end the culture of impunity," Ocampo said on receiving the list compiled by the UN-appointed International Commission of Inquiry five days after the Security Council voted to refer Darfur cases to the tribunal as recommendedby an international panel of inquiry into whether genocide had occurred in Darfur. "I will closely monitor ongoing crimes in Darfur as well as efforts to prevent and stop them," he added. Earlier Tuesday, the ICC, based in The Hague, received thousands of documents collected by the Commission, and Ocampo said he would analyze them and assess the crimes and the admissibility of the cases. Meanwhile in Khartoum, Sudan's capital, the UN mission reportedthat some of the tens of thousands of protesters attacked the perimeter fence of the UN Development Program compound. When that failed, they threw stones into it until a group of elders and community leaders passed a letter into the building for transmission to the Secretary-General. The Security Council passed a resolution last Thursday referring the Darfur situation to the ICC, based in The Hague, Netherlands, after the United States, a strong opponent of the ICC,chose to abstain. Under the resolution, war crimes and crimes against humanity that have occurred in Darfur since July 1, 2002, will be dealt with by the court. But the ICC will not start investigation or prosecution within one year after the adoption of the resolution. However, the Sudanese government officially announced on Sunday its rejection to United Nations Security Council resolution 1593 referring war crime suspects in Darfur to the International Criminal Court. Boxes of documents have been delivered to the court Last week, the UN Security Council passed a resolution referring the situation in Darfur to the tribunal. But Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir says his country will refuse to co-operate with the court in The Hague.

Chinese rioters storm Japanese embassy in Beijing
Anti-Japanese protests have been building throughout the week The rallies follow a 10,000-strong march in the Chinese capital - the city's biggest protest since 1999. Protesters are angry at a new Japanese history textbook which they believe plays down Japan's wartime atrocities. Japan has protested to China after stone-throwing protesters attacked Japan's embassy in Beijing on Saturday. Japan's foreign minister is to visit China next week to discuss "a number of bilateral and international issues", a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry said. Security measures At least 3,000 people demonstrated at the Japanese consulate in the southern city of Guangzhou on Sunday, shouting for a boycott of Japanese goods and burning Japanese flags. Hong Kong cable television showed protesters with Chinese flags and banners reading "down with Japanese militarism". A city hall spokesman said the "spontaneous demonstration" was peaceful and under control. Thousands more marched in Shenzhen, also in the southern Guangdong province, and threw objects at Japanese-owned businesses. The ambassador, Wang Yi, said Beijing did not condone the protests. 'Whitewash' The protests were sparked by new Japanese schoolbooks, which many Chinese say whitewash Japan's occupation of much of China during the 1930s and early 1940s. Critics are angered that one of the books refers to the killing of more than 250,000 civilians by Japanese troops in the Chinese city of Nanjing in 1937 as an "incident", rather than the "massacre" it is known as elsewhere.

Lib Dems launch manifesto
Kennedy: Wants Iraq exit strategy The Lib Dems say replacing council tax with a new local income tax will make 15 million households better off. Mr Kennedy, returning after the birth of his son, also wants UK troops to leave Iraq by the end of the year. The Tories said a vote for the Lib Dems would mean higher taxes, while Labour said the Lib Dems' sums didn't add up. The Liberal Democrats have been the real opposition Charles Kennedy Lib Dem launch Taking charge again on Thursday, two days after his wife Sarah gave birth to their son Donald, Mr Kennedy said the manifesto was "based on fairness, based on opportunity". 'Dignity' He described the document as a "fully-costed and affordable programme to create a fair Britain". It offered "dignity for older people, real opportunity for our children and a fair deal for families", he said. The 20-page newspaper-style manifesto includes plans for a new 50% top tax rate on earnings over £100,000 to pay for its commitments.

They claim six million pensioners would pay no local tax at all under the plans. But at the launch Mr Kennedy appeared confused about how much the tax would raise and who would end up paying more. Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor admitted his leader had struggled to remember a figure but put it down to the new father's lack of sleep.

Immigration and asylum turn voters off UK Tories
Michael Howard declared yesterday that he would continue to be "vigilant" about immigration to ensure that race relations in Britain are not damaged by unease about the highly sensitive issue. Unbowed by harsh criticism from a television audience on Monday about his hardline stance, the Tory leader said that good community relations went "hand in hand" with firm controls on immigration. "If we are to continue to have good community relations in this country you have to be vigilant," Mr Howard said at the Conservatives' daily press conference. "And if people lose confidence in the system and believe it's out of control, I believe that breeds a sense of insecurity and that's damaging to good community relations." "No, we have had no such calls, neither to me nor to my office," he said. The Guardian understands, however, that a number of frontbenchers did contact a Howard aide to ask for a "broadening" of the party's election campaign. Mr Howard, who yesterday pledged to crack down on binge drinkers, will today attempt to show that he has a broad campaign by offering help to middle income earners. At his morning press conference the Conservative leader will pledge to scrap the council tax revaluation which is due to take place in 2007. The announcement came amid a dawning realisation across the party that the Tories may be heading for another heavy defeat after a Populus poll in the Times showed that Labour has increased its lead from two to nine points. Few Tories believe that Mr Howard has made a strategic blunder in the way that William Hague alienated middle ground voters with his warning about Britain turning into a "foreign land". But there are fears that he has made tactical errors, such as concentrating too much on immigration and opening the party up to charges that its brief manifesto looks more like a list of grievances than a programme for government. David Curry, a supporter of the former chancellor Kenneth Clarke who resigned last year from Mr Howard's shadow cabinet, said he was pleased that the party was concentrating on the "real issues" of schools, hospitals, crime, tax and immigration.

Syria: Lebanon pullout is "full and complete", UN to verify
It is not yet clear whether Lebanon has full control of its territory In a report to the Security Council, he said he had received a letter from Syria saying full withdrawal was complete - claims the UN is examining. In September, the Security Council passed a resolution calling for foreign forces to be withdrawn from Lebanon. The council is due to discuss Mr Annan's report later in the week. A UN team has just gone to Lebanon to verify the withdrawal of all Syrian troops, military assets and intelligence. Southern control In his report on the implementation of the resolution, Mr Annan pointed out that other UN requirements had still not been met. SYRIA IN LEBANON Military intervention began in 1976 30,000 troops in Lebanon during 1980s, 14,000 by 2005 Syrian forces helped end Lebanese civil war in 1990 and maintain peace Calls for Syrian withdrawal increased in 2000 after Israeli pull-out from southern Lebanon UN resolution calling for foreign forces' withdrawal in Sept 2004 In pictures: Troops leave Mixed reaction from press Lebanese political reaction Mr Annan said several incidents had shown the government did not have full control of all its territory and he added there had been no change in the position of the militias and that armed vigilante groups were now being set up as well. The UN chief said that according to the Lebanese and Syrian governments assertions that Syrian military intelligence had taken up new positions south of Beirut were untrue. Mr Annan said Lebanon had reached a critical juncture and it was time for all parties to set aside the vestiges of the past. He called for free and fair elections to be held on schedule, warning any delay would threaten the security, stability and prosperity of the country. Damascus has denied any role in the death of Hariri, who was killed by a car bomb in Beirut, but the event prompted giant protests calling for the Syrians to go. Prominently seated in the audience was Syria's top intelligence chief in Lebanon, Maj. Gen. Rustom Ghazali, who is widely considered to have held the reins of Lebanese politics for years.

Galloway and Pasqua deny any wrongdoing on their part in the oil-for-food program
The vitriolic tone used by Mr. Galloway was rare for a witness in a Senate hearing. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Galloway, a maverick politician ousted from the Labor Party for his fervent opposition to the Iraq war and his blunt criticism of Prime Minister Tony Blair, did not deny that he had had contacts with Iraq but said that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had met more often with Saddam Hussein than he had. The subcommittee's chairman, Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota, seemed a bit taken aback by the intensity of Mr. Galloway's remarks, stumbling over some questions, or demanding "yes" or "no" answers, which the British lawmaker refused to give. In one transaction, Mr. Coleman said, surcharges of more than $300,000 were paid illegally to the Hussein regime as part of the covert arrangement. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Galloway called this "preposterous," adding, "I have never seen a barrel of oil, owned one, bought one, sold one, and neither has anybody on my behalf." Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Coleman later told reporters he did not consider Mr. Galloway "a credible witness." The United Nations program, which lasted from late 1996 to 2003, was meant to prevent Mr. Hussein from using oil profits for weaponry, while easing the sanctions imposed after the first Gulf War amid charges they had resulted in suffering for the Iraqi people. The unapologetic Mr. Galloway put a dramatic face on a scandal that has been largely bogged down in the arcane details of diverted oil shipments, translated documents, shadowy go-betweens and questionable payments. "The biggest sanctions busters were not me or Russian politicians or French politicians," he said, "the real sanctions busters were your own companies with the connivance of your own government."

BBC drops programmes as third of staff join strike
Striking employees picketed outside BBC Television Centre The BBC said 38% of staff due to work on Monday joined the walkout over plans to cut 3,780 jobs, though unions said they believed up to 55% had taken part. Hardest hit were live shows on BBC Radio 4, Five Live, the World Service and TV channels News 24 and BBC World. Unions threaten further strikes unless "meaningful negotiations" are offered. The strike has scuppered Radio 4's flagship shows including Today and PM and forced changes to BBC One's Breakfast and Chelsea Flower Show coverage. The main news programmes on BBC One throughout the day were taken from News 24.

Arkansas plans to end its series of April executions by putting to death on Thursday an inmate convicted of murdering a cheerleader and who escaped from prison and killed two other people before being captured again. Brazil's president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has come under growing fire with the emergence of a two-year-old videotape that shows a senior government official soliciting campaign contributions for two of the party's candidates and offering lucrative political favors in return. The official, Waldomiro Diniz, was fired last Friday, hours after the incriminating video appeared on the website of Epoca, a weekly newsmagazine. But the resulting scandal threatens to engulf the leftwing government led by the Workers' Party, which has always portrayed itself as the only clean force in the murky world of Brazilian politics. Mr da Silva is the founder of the party, and he ran three times for president as its candidate before winning in 2002. "Lula is confronting the most delicate moment of his administration," the daily Jornal do Brasil warned on Sunday. Opposition leaders have responded to the revelations by calling for a congressional investigation and demanding the immediate resignation of Jose Dirceu de Oliveira e Silva, the president's chief of staff and Mr Diniz's immediate superior. The Workers' Party president, Jose Genoino, has tried to distance the party from the scandal and the damage it has done by arguing that Mr Diniz was "not enrolled in the party."

Citizen groups ask Congress to file formal "Resolution of Inquiry" against Bush
CORRECTION APPENDED More than two weeks after its publication in London, a previously secret British government memorandum that reported in July 2002 that President Bush had decided to ''remove Saddam, through military action'' is still creating a stir among administration critics. They are portraying it as evidence that Mr. Bush was intent on war with Iraq earlier than the White House has acknowledged. The letter, drafted by Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said the British memorandum of July 23, 2002, if accurate, ''raises troubling new questions regarding the legal justifications for the war as well as the integrity of your own administration.'' It has long been known that American military planning for the Iraq war began as early as Nov. 21, 2001, after President Bush directed Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to begin a review of what would be required to oust Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader. By July 2002, the war planning was sufficiently advanced that newspaper accounts that month reported details of some of what was being considered. On Aug. 26, 2002, Vice President Dick Cheney appeared before the Veterans of Foreign Wars to warn that ''there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction'' and that ''there is no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends, our allies and against us.'' But Congress did not vote until Oct. 16, 2002, to authorize Mr. Bush to go to war in Iraq. The White House has always insisted that Mr. Bush did not finally decide to carry out the invasion of March 2003 until after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell presented the administration's case to the United Nations Security Council, in a speech on Feb. 5, 2003, that relied heavily on claims, now discredited, that Iraq had illicit weapons and was supporting terrorism. But the British memorandum, which records the minutes of a meeting of Prime Minister Tony Blair's senior foreign policy advisers, does provide some contemporaneous validation for those accounts, though only through secondhand observations. Among other things, the memorandum reported that Sir Richard Dearlove, the chief of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, reporting back from talks in Washington, had told other senior British officials that President Bush ''wanted to remove'' Mr. Hussein, ''through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and W.M.D.,'' or weapons of mass destruction. ''But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy,'' Sir Richard was reported in the memorandum to have told his colleagues. One of them, Foreign Minister Jack Straw, was reported to have described the case for war as ''thin'' because ''Saddam was not threatening his neighbors and his W.M.D.

Former FBI Second-In-Command says he was 'Deep Throat'
Deep Throat, the secret source whose insider guidance was vital to The Washington Post’s groundbreaking coverage of the Watergate scandal, was a pillar of the FBI named W. Mark Felt, The Post confirmed yesterday. As the bureau’s second- and third-ranking official during a period when the FBI was battling for its independence against the administration of President Richard M. Nixon, Felt had the means and the motive to help uncover the web of internal spies, secret surveillance, dirty tricks and coverups that led to Nixon’s unprecedented resignation on Aug. 9, 1974, and to prison sentences for some of Nixon’s highest-ranking aides. Felt’s identity as Washington’s most celebrated secret source had been an object of speculation for more than 30 years until yesterday, when his role was revealed by his family in a Vanity Fair magazine article. Even Nixon was caught on tape speculating that Felt was “an informer” as early as February 1973, at a time when Deep Throat was supplying confirmation and context for some of The Post’s most explosive Watergate stories. But Felt’s repeated denials, and the stalwart silence of the reporters he aided -- Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein -- kept the cloak of mystery drawn up around Deep Throat. In place of a name and a face, the source acquired a magic and a mystique. This image was rendered indelibly by the dramatic best-selling memoir Woodward and Bernstein published in 1974, “All the President’s Men.” Two years later, in a blockbuster movie of the same name, actor Hal Holbrook breathed whispery urgency into the suspenseful late-night encounters between Woodward and his source. For many Americans under 40, this is the most potent distillation of the complicated brew that was Watergate. “Mark Felt at that time was a dashing gray-haired figure,” Woodward recalled, and his experience as an anti-Nazi spy hunter early in his career at the FBI had endowed him with a whole bag of counterintelligence tricks. Felt dreamed up the signal by which Woodward would summon him to a meeting (a flowerpot innocuously displayed on the reporter’s balcony) and also hatched the countersign by which Felt could contact Woodward (a clock face inked on Page 20 of Woodward’s daily New York Times). “He knew he was taking a monumental risk,” said Woodward, now an assistant managing editor of The Post whose catalogue of prizewinning and best-selling work has been built on the sort of confidential relationships he maintained with Deep Throat.

US Congress House panel OKs big cut in public broadcasting funds
agenda is to control public broadcasting or to defund it," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. "House Republicans have gutted funding for public broadcasting stations across the country." Advertisement Continue reading the main story The vote came as public stations and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are engaged in a debate over the editorial balance in programming and the independence of the stations. The head of the Republican-controlled corporation, Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, has pressed public broadcasting to correct what he and other conservatives consider liberal bias. That has prompted public broadcasting leaders -- including the chief executive of PBS -- to object that his actions pose a threat to editorial independence. Some public broadcasting officials have begun to express concern that the perception of political interference by the corporation would discourage individuals from making financial contributions to the stations. Mr. Tomlinson, meanwhile, has said that the perception that the stations are not balanced could prompt the Republican-controlled Congress to significantly reduce financing.

Bomb blasts kill several in Iran
The bombs in Ahwaz exploded over a two-hour period Four blasts targeted public buildings in the south-western city of Ahwaz, killing at least eight people and wounding more than 70 others. Hours later, a bomb exploded in the capital Tehran, killing two people. Bombings have been rare in Iran since the war with Iraq ended in 1988. Ahwaz, which is close to the Iraq border, was the focus of unrest between Arabs and Persians in April, when several people were reportedly killed. 'Failure' The bombings in Ahwaz took place over a two-hour period. Two went off near government offices and a fourth exploded near the home of a local state television executive. The interior ministry also confirmed that a bottle filled with explosives blew up in Vali Asr square in central Tehran, but there were no reports of casualties. A spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's top security decision-making body, blamed the attacks on separatist Arabs aided by members of the armed Iraq-based opposition group, the People's Mujahideen, and remnants of the Baath Party. The spokesman, Agha Mohammadi, told the BBC he was sure the Americans were behind the attacks and also suggested that Britain might be involved - but he gave no evidence to support his claims. "Whoever is responsible for this, the target of the blasts is to undermine Friday's presidential elections," said interior ministry spokesman Jahanbaksh Khanjani.

Michael Jackson found 'not guilty' on all counts
Jackson not guilty Jurors acquit pop star of all molestation charges   SANTA MARIA, California (CNN) -- A California jury has exonerated Michael Jackson of the child molestation, conspiracy and alcohol charges that could have sent him to prison for nearly 20 years. The jury deliberated about 32 hours throughout the course of seven days before reaching its decision. The clerk of court read the verdicts Monday in a packed courtroom while a large crowd of supporters waited outside. Jackson fans cheered, wept and hugged upon hearing the verdicts. (Fans react) Courtroom observers reported that Jackson dabbed his eyes with a tissue after his acquittal. Prosecutors had charged the singer with four counts of lewd conduct with a child younger than 14; one count of attempted lewd conduct; four counts of administering alcohol to facilitate child molestation; and one count of conspiracy to commit child abduction, false imprisonment or extortion. Santa Barbara County District Attorney Thomas Sneddon sat grim-faced during the reading of the verdict and said later that he would accept the decision. "In 37 years [as a prosecutor], I've never quibbled with a jury's verdict, and I'm not going to start today," Sneddon said. Looking drawn and expressionless, Jackson did not address the throng before leaving the courthouse in a caravan of black sport utility vehicles. His lead defense attorney, Thomas Mesereau Jr., told reporters on his way out of the courthouse that "justice was done."

United States Supreme Court Justice O'Connor to retire
Justice O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the court, has been regarded as a centrist and "swing vote," as was Potter Stewart, the man she succeeded in 1981, after President Ronald Reagan nominated her.

Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, was just as warm as Senator Reid in his praise of Justice O'Connor - but blunter in threatening to resist a nominee he would find unpalatable. Mr. Kennedy called Justice O'Connor "a mainstream conservative" and "a wise judge who served the nation and the Constitution well." Mr. Bush's choice for a replacement, Senator Kennedy went on, "affects each and every American and has the potential to impact every facet of constitutional law and the freedoms this country was founded upon." "If the president abuses his power and nominates someone who threatens to roll back the rights and freedoms of the American people," Mr. Kennedy said, "then the American people will insist that we oppose that nominee, and we intend to do so."

Newspaper refuses to utilize leaked documents in article
The Nation Fearing Legal Battle, Ohio Newspaper Holds Stories On Wednesday, New York Times reporter Judith Miller was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to testify about a confidential source. "It was documentation that would have been illegal to share, so there wasn't any ambiguity about what we had," Clifton said. The Plain Dealer is trying to find a way to publish the stories without relying on the documents, editor Doug Clifton said. CLEVELAND — The Plain Dealer, Ohio's largest newspaper, is holding two investigative stories based on leaked documents because they could result in the type of court showdown that led to a New York Times reporter being jailed, the paper's editor said Friday. A prosecutor wants information from Miller as part of an investigation of how the name of an undercover CIA officer was leaked to a columnist. Clifton said the Plain Dealer had decided several weeks ago -- before Miller was imprisoned -- to withhold the stories because the leaked documents could result in subpoenas and court sanctions, including jail. Clifton wrote a column June 30 explaining to readers the importance of protecting sources, and how the public would suffer if reporters' ability to gather news is compromised. He mentioned the potential consequences if the newspaper published the two investigative stories. "I wanted the public to understand that this isn't an abstraction, that this is a real issue," he said Friday. "Things that are important for the public stand in jeopardy of not getting reported because of the state of the law."

Wilson calls for Rove removal
Chief presidential adviser Karl Rove testified to a grand jury that he talked with two journalists before they divulged the identity of an undercover CIA officer but that he originally learned about the operative from the news media and not government sources, according to a person briefed on the testimony. The person, who works in the legal profession and spoke only on condition of anonymity because of grand jury secrecy, told The Associated Press that Rove testified last year that he remembers specifically being told by columnist Robert Novak that Valerie Plame, the wife of a harsh Iraq war critic, worked for the CIA. The conversation eventually turned to Plame’s husband, Joseph Wilson, a former ambassador who was strongly criticizing the Bush administration’s use of faulty intelligence to justify the war in Iraq, the person said. Rove testified that Novak told him he planned to report in a weekend column that Plame had worked for the CIA, and the circumstances on how her husband traveled to Africa to check bogus claims that Iraq was trying to buy nuclear materials in Niger, according to the source. Rove told the grand jury that by the time Novak had called him, he believes he had similar information about Wilson’s wife from another member of the news media but he could not recall which reporter had told him about it first, the person said. When Novak inquired about Wilson’s wife working for the CIA, Rove indicated he had heard something like that, according to the source’s recounting of the grand jury testimony. Rove told the grand jury that three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and — in an effort to discredit some of Wilson’s allegations — informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson’s wife worked for the CIA, though he never used her name, the source said. An e-mail Cooper recently provided the grand jury shows Cooper reported to his magazine bosses that Rove had described Wilson’s wife in a confidential conversation as someone who “apparently works” at the CIA. His wife’s “ability to do the job she’s been doing for close to 20 years ceased from the minute Novak’s article appeared; she ceased being a clandestine officer,” he said.

Possible 'mastermind' of London bombings captured in Egypt
The U.S.-trained chemist who police believe is the mastermind behind last week's London transit attacks has been captured, Egyptian and Western intelligence sources tell ABC News. Magdy Elnashar, 33, who authorities believe helped build the bombs, was taken into custody in suburban Cairo, Egypt. Elnashar had left England two weeks before the bombings, and British authorities had initiated a worldwide manhunt for him. Police say it was Elnashar who helped the bombers set up their bomb factory in Leeds. Elnashar's capture came as British authorities released the first surveillance photo of one of the bombers in the hours before the attacks. Hasib Hussain, 18, is seen carrying the backpack that exploded on a double-decker bus two-and-a-half hours later. Hussain was described by Britain's top police official as just a foot soldier. "What we've got to find now is the people who trained them, who built their bombs," said Ian Blair, commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police. British authorities also identified a fourth bomber as a Jamaica-born man with a pregnant wife in England and a mother living in the United States. Mr al-Nashar completed a chemistry PhD at Leeds University Magdi Mahmoud al-Nashar, 33, had not been seen by colleagues at Leeds University since early July.

Germany's July unemployment rate falls slightly
Unemployment will be a key issue in the forthcoming general election The number of people out of work dropped by 42,000 to 4.8 million, or 11.6% of the workforce, the Federal Labour Office said. But without seasonal adjustments, the jobless rate rose by 68,000 to 4.77 million, or 11.5% of the workforce. The figures come just two months ahead of a planned general election. The ranks of Germany's unemployed often swell in July, as school leavers and trainees who have finished their apprenticeships enter the jobs market. Companies are also often reluctant to take on new staff ahead of the summer holidays. Political battleground The key element for the economy is really the number of new jobs that are being created, and we haven't seen much progress on that front yet Carsten Klude, MM Warburg The fall in seasonally adjusted joblessness may point to a recovery in Germany's battered labour market, though economists greeted the figures with caution. Unemployment looks set to be a major issue in the forthcoming general election. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's ruling Social Democrat (SPD) coalition is preparing to face an electorate angry at recent record levels of post-war unemployment. Opinion polls recently showed the SPD lagging behind the conservative opposition Christian Democrats by up to 17 percentage points. "Perhaps the worst has passed," said Sandra Petcov, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.

Sudan’s Vice President killed in helicopter crash
Southern Sudanese hoped John Garang would change their lives At least 20 people were reported dead in the clashes in the capital. Mr Garang, Sudan's newly appointed vice-president, died in a helicopter crash as he was returning from Uganda. He signed a deal to end 21 years of civil war in January and was sworn in as deputy leader three weeks ago. His former rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), has nominated deputy leader Salva Kiir as his successor and the next vice-president of Sudan. Eerie calm The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Khartoum says that in choosing Mr Kiir, the SPLM has sent a clear message that there will be no radical departure from the Garang era. US President George W Bush, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and others joined Mr Kiir in urging the Sudanese people to remain calm and continue to implement the peace agreement. Dr Garang was one of the most visionary and incisive revolutionary thinkers and nationalists Africa has ever produced President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda Obituary: John Garang In pictures: John Garang Reaction in quotes Our correspondent says gangs of youths from southern Sudan - Mr Garang's home - appeared on the streets, looting cars, throwing stones and smashing office windows. Gunfire could be heard and there were clashes with security forces as they tried to seal off the city centre. However, shortly after an overnight curfew was imposed at 1800 (1500 GMT), there was an eerie calm on the streets, our correspondent reports. Mr Garang steered the SPLM rebels from the Christian and animist south through a war against the Islamic government in the north which left some 1.5m people dead. Our correspondent says many of the 4m southern Sudanese living in Khartoum hoped Mr Garang would change their lives, and they are now venting their frustration at his death.

The longtime anchor of ABC "World News Tonight" died Sunday, some four months after he announced on the air that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer. "Good Morning America" co-host Charles Gibson announced late Sunday that Jennings had died in his New York City apartment. His wife, Kayce, his children Elizabeth and Christopher, and his sister were at his side, Gibson said. He read a statement from the family that said: "Peter died with his family around him, without pain and in peace. He knew he had lived a good life." ABC News President David Westin told reporters Monday that it was a sad day at the network where Jennings had worked for more than 40 years. "Peter, in addition to being an outstanding journalist, an outstanding leader, was also a very warm and decent man and a great friend and colleague to so many of us," Westin said. But in fact he was a very sensitive, warm, decent man who cared passionately for what he did, for what all of us do -- for reporting the news every day of the year." In a written statement to his staff, Westin wrote on Sunday that "we will have many opportunities in the coming hours and days to remember Peter for all that he meant to us all. But for the moment, the finest tribute we can give is to continue to do the work he loved so much and inspired us to do."

Brazilian shot by police on London Underground was not acting suspiciously
Family representatives and campaigners for the Brazilian man shot dead on a London tube train are demanding to know how Scotland Yard allowed misleading information to circulate about his killing. In the wake of a leak last night from the independent report, which revealed eyewitnesses seeing Jean Charles de Menezes being held by police in his seat before being shot in the head, attention has now turned to the initial accounts of his death. These claimed he ran from police, vaulted a ticket barrier and was shot on the floor of the carriage. Helen Shaw, co-director of the deaths in custody campaign group Inquest, said today that differences between the accounts - including the disclosure that he was not, as previously claimed, wearing a bulky padded jacket - raised concerns about police conduct. "The public should be told why the Metropolitan police did not correct the misinformation about Mr de Menezes' clothing and actions once the facts became clear," she said. Asad Rehman, a spokesman for the De Menezes family campaign, said the position of Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, would no longer be tenable if "it is demonstrated that he wilfully misled the public, that he wilfully misled the family about the circumstances of Jean's death." Mr de Menezes was shot dead in the carriage of a tube train at Stockwell station on July 22 in the mistaken belief that he was linked to the previous day's failed bomb attempts. A report in today's Financial Times said surveillance officers mistook him for Hussein Osman, the July 21 bomb plot suspect whose extradition to Britain was today approved by a court in Italy. Initial accounts suggested that Mr de Menezes had fled from armed officers by vaulting over barriers before stumbling on to an underground train, where the officers opened fire. One witness in the carriage, Mark Whitby, 47, whose account formed an important part of the subsequent reports, said he had seen a man who looked Pakistani "hotly pursued by what I knew to be three plain-clothes police officers". He described the man wearing "a coat like you would wear in winter, a sort of padded jacket" and looking as petrified as "a cornered rabbit" when he got on the train. According to documents obtained by ITV News from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which is investigating the shooting, Mr de Menezes was filmed on CCTV cameras entering the station at a normal walking pace and even picking up a free copy of the Metro newspaper.

Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson calls for assassination of Venezuela's president
Mr Robertson caused controversy with the comments on his TV show, describing Mr Chavez as "a terrific danger". Venezuela's vice president accused Robertson of making "terrorist" remarks and said the US response would put its anti-terror policy to the test. The US State Department said the comments were "inappropriate" and did not reflect the policy of the US. 'Cheaper than war' Mr Robertson's remarks come amid tense diplomatic relations between Venezuela and Washington. You know, I don't know about this doctrine of assassination, but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it Pat Robertson President Chavez is a regular critic of the US, which regards Venezuela as a possible source of instability in the region. Mr Chavez has accused Washington of conspiring to topple his government and possibly backing plots to assassinate him. Mr Robertson, 75, said on Monday's edition of the 700 Club: "You know, I don't know about this doctrine of assassination, but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it. "It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war ... and I don't think any oil shipments will stop." Mr Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition of America and a former presidential candidate, accused the United States of failing to act when Mr Chavez was briefly overthrown in 2002. Venezuela is the fifth-largest oil exporter and a major supplier of oil to the United States. State Department spokesman San McCormack said Mr Robertson was speaking as a private citizen and that the US administration did not share his views.

Iberia burning: forest fires rage across Portugal
By Sam Wilson BBC News website  Arsonists may be motivated by excitement, revenge, or profit Both countries have arrested more than 100 people on suspicion of arson this summer. Many have been teenaged boys but some are firefighters themselves. More than 30 people have been killed by the blazes, while great swathes of countryside and scores of homes have been consumed. While lightning and other environmental factors are responsible for some fires, the majority are started by humans. 'Hero factor' Many are down to careless accidents - a discarded cigarette or neglected campfire - but a large number, according to experts, are started in cold blood. "Generally about 30% of human-caused wildfires are deliberately set," says Timothy Huff, a former FBI profiler specialising in arson, who has investigated hundreds of fires in California and elsewhere. The figures vary between areas, but Spain's Civil Guard believes at least 125 of the 829 fires it has investigated this summer were started deliberately. Investigators say developers may start fires to clear land The 33-year-old head of a Spanish fire fighting unit has been accused of setting about 15 fires in the Galicia region. A Spanish website reported that he was put under surveillance after expressing anger at not being assigned to a local brigade. Mr Huff lists six potential motives for arsonists: revenge, excitement, profit, vandalism, extremism, and to cover another crime. "Excitement is one of the big ones for wildfires," he tells the BBC News website. This covers not only teenaged boys, getting a thrill by watching a fire take hold and spread, but those motivated by the "hero factor" - people who want to be involved and to take the credit for fighting the blaze.

Chimpanzee genome sequenced
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 31 (Xinhuanet) -- A comprehensive comparison of the newly deciphered chimpanzee genome sequence and that of humans shows our closest living relatives share perfect identity with 96 percent of our DNA sequence, an international research consortium reported Wednesday. In a paper published in the Sept.1 issue of the journal Nature,the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, including 67 researchers from the United States, Israel, Italy, Germany and Spain, described the landmark study comparing the genome of the chimp with that of human. Related papers will also appear in the journal Science. "As our closest living evolutionary relatives, chimpanzees are especially suited to teach us about ourselves," said Robert Waterston, chair of the Department of Genome Sciences of the University of Washington School of Medicine. "We still do not have in our hands the answer to a most fundamental question: What makes us human? The DNA sequence that can be directly compared between the two genomes is almost 99 percent identical. When DNA insertions and deletions are taken into account, humans and chimpsstill share 96 percent of their sequence, the researchers found. In fact, the typical human protein has accumulated just one unique change since chimps and humans diverged from a common ancestor about 6 million years ago. The researchers indicated the rapid evolution of these genes may have contributed to the special characteristics of primates, but further studies are needed to explore the possibilities.

It is not clear when or where the tape was filmed. On the tape the bomber said: "Our words are dead until we give them life with our blood. "I and thousands like me have forsaken everything for what we believe." He said the public was responsible for the atrocities perpetuated against his "people" across the world because it supported democratically elected governments who carried them out. "Until we feel security, you will be our targets," he said. "Until you stop the bombing, gassing, imprisonment and torture of my people we will not stop this fight.

Federal response to Katrina a "national disgrace"
The mayor of New Orleans issued "a desperate SOS" yesterday as the effort to evacuate thousands of people still trapped in the flooded city was hindered by mob violence and gunfire. The appeal came as angry crowds clashed with police, and the city's police chief warned that storm victims were being raped and beaten on the streets. National guardsmen were moving into New Orleans in armoured vehicles to re-establish order and help the evacuation. But reports from the city described desperate scenes in the Superdome stadium and the city convention centre, where tens of thousands were awaiting evacuation, with fights breaking out, rubbish catching fire and dead bodies left uncollected. According to the police chief, Eddie Compass, an angry mob drove back 88 officers who were sent to restore order. "We have individuals who are getting raped, we have individuals who are getting beaten," he said. Hurricane Katrina, which struck America's Gulf coast on Monday, and the subsequent flooding of New Orleans, is believed by officials to have taken thousands of lives. Aid officials said helicopter missions to evacuate patients from New Orleans hospitals had been suspended because some helicopters had come under fire, possibly from armed civilians angry they were not being rescued. President George Bush called for "zero tolerance" towards criminals and promised the federal government was doing everything possible to speed the rescue. But the city's mayor, Ray Nagin, predicted there would not be enough buses to rescue people in the convention centre "This is a desperate SOS," Mr Nagin said on CNN TV.

President Bush nominates John Roberts as Chief Justice of the U.S.
Not one senator has shown outright opposition to Judge Roberts Mr Roberts had originally been nominated to replace another Supreme Court judge who is retiring, and was awaiting Senate confirmation. Mr Bush described him as a man of integrity and fairness with a reputation for goodwill and decency. Democrats will want to question him on issues such as abortion, church-state matters and the environment. However correspondents say his nomination is unlikely to prove controversial. Mr Rehnquist, a conservative appointed chief justice by President Reagan in 1986, died at the age of 80 on Saturday from thyroid cancer. Confirmation hope Mr Roberts, 50, said he would be honoured "to succeed a man I deeply respect and admire".

He said he would do so in a "timely manner". Ms O'Connor has offered to continue her duties until a successor is found. Glittering career Mr Bush said he hoped the Senate would confirm Mr Roberts' appointment within a month, when the Supreme Court is due to reconvene. If Judge Roberts is not confirmed before the court resumes work in October, Mr Rehnquist's administrative duties will be taken over by liberal Justice John Paul Stevens until a new chief is confirmed. He graduated from Harvard Law School with flying colours in 1979, and was a former clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist before serving in the Reagan administration.

FEMA head relieved of duties
Amid harsh criticism of federal relief efforts, Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff announced Friday that Michael Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is handing over Hurricane Katrina relief duties to a Coast Guard official and returning to Washington to oversee the national office. “Other challenges and threats remain around the world,” and Brown is needed to prepare for those, Chertoff said at a news conference in Baton Rouge. “Michael Brown has done everything he possibly could to coordinate the federal response to this unprecedented challenge,” Chertoff added. He sidestepped a question on whether the move was the first step toward Brown’s leaving FEMA. But a source close to Brown, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the FEMA director had been considering leaving after the hurricane season ended in November and that Friday’s action virtually assures his departure. Coast Guard Vice Adm. Thad Allen Brown, 50, is handing over relief duties to Coast Guard Vice Adm. Thad Allen, who earlier this week was named Brown's deputy to oversee relief and rescue efforts. Chertoff did not allow reporters to ask Brown questions directly and would not respond to the Time magazine report Friday that Brown’s official biography overstated his emergency-management experience. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Friday that local and state officials shouldn’t have to share in the blame for the poor response because they “were in fact victims and not able to respond.” Brown blames media Asked ahead of the announcement if he was being made a scapegoat, Brown told The Associated Press after a long pause: "By the press, yes. I’m still the director of FEMA.” He said Chertoff made the decision to move him out of Louisiana.

All major American TV networks show charity concert for Katrina victims
share tweet email With the flood waters of Katrina yet to recede, Randy Newman sang about a long-ago hurricane in “Louisiana 1927” to open a benefit program spread across dozens of television networks Friday. Dr. John ended a show suffused with the spirit of a musical city singing a song that’s only a wish now: “Walkin’ to New Orleans.” The hour-long appeal was an echo of a somber event held four years ago to benefit victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, with the same producer. This time, the telethon had more determination than shock and featured native jazz, gospel and swamp-rock sounds. “Tonight let’s show people on the Gulf Coast that they have friends all over the world, friends who care, who understand and are there to give them shelter from the storm,” said comic Ellen DeGeneres, who was raised in New Orleans. ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, UPN and the WB — the six biggest broadcast networks — aired it along with several cable networks. Viewers in nearly 100 countries were able to tune in. BET was also appealing for help Friday for victims of a tragedy that struck the black community hard, and MTV planned its own concert for Saturday. “We always thought faster was better than slower,” Clinton said. NBC stations televised an appeal last week, marked by rapper Kanye West’s off-script comment that “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” The performers largely stuck to scripts Friday, including West, who sang “Jesus Walks” with a gospel choir.

Panic-buying as petrol protests sweep Britain
Cars queue for petrol in Essex on Tuesday - Photo by Paul Wood The Fuel Lobby's Andrew Spence said no oil refinery blockades were planned so there was no need to stock up. Some petrol stations have reportedly "run dry", while others are employing extra staff to cope with the demand. Merseyside Police have asked people not to ring 999 to ask where to buy fuel after phone lines became strained.

Last week the government reportedly discussed plans to deal with a threat to fuel supplies - including the possibility of petrol rationing. A Department of Trade and Industry document details possible measures including purchase limits, restricted opening hours, and moves to discourage motorists from frequently topping up their fuel tanks. Mr Spence told BBC News it was this talk of rationing that had prompted motorists to stock up.

US clinic plans first face transplant
The procedure would take about 10 hours Doctors in the US have already carried out the procedure on bodies donated for medical research. Now the Cleveland Clinic team will choose a patient whose face is disfigured to receive a "new" face from a dead donor. The chance it will work is around 50% and experts have expressed safety and ethical concerns about the procedure. A new face The recipient would have to take powerful anti-rejection drugs for life, which carry considerable long-term health risks, says the Royal College of Surgeons of England, which formed a working party to look at the issue earlier this year. Also, it is not known how well an individual and their loved ones would adapt psychologically to a completely new face. There are a great many questions to which answers are needed Changing Faces charity It is hard to predict what the person would look like after a face transplant. The procedure would involve taking skin and underlying tissues from a dead donor and placing them on the living recipient. The face should take on more of the characteristics of the skeleton of the recipient than the soft tissues of the donor. Picking a patient The working party said it was not against facial transplants in theory, saying they could offer a major breakthrough in restoration of quality of life to those whose faces have been destroyed by accidents or disease. You want to choose patients who are really disfigured, not someone who has a little scar Surgeon Maria Siemionow But it cautioned: "Until there is further research and the prospect of better control of these complications, it would be unwise to proceed with human facial transplantation." After a year of discussions, the Cleveland Clinic won approval to go ahead with the operation from an internal review board, which included surgeons, psychiatrists, social workers, therapists, nurses and patient advocates. Dr Siemionow told Associated Press: "You want to choose patients who are really disfigured, not someone who has a little scar."

Basra, Iraq raid by UK forces to rescue soldiers from police
BAGHDAD, Sept. 19 (Xinhuanet) -- Iraqi police detained two British soldiers in civilian clothes in the southern city Basra for firing on a police station on Monday, police said. "Two persons wearing Arab uniforms opened fire at a police station in Basra. A police patrol followed the attackers and captured them to discover they were two British soldiers," an Interior Ministry source told Xinhua. The two soldiers were using a civilian car packed with explosives, the source said. The British forces informed the Iraqi authorities that the two soldiers were performing an official duty, the source said. British military authorities said they could not confirm the incident but investigations were underway. BAGHDAD, Sept. 19 -- British armored vehicles backed by helicopter gunships burst through the walls of an Iraqi jail Monday in the southern city of Basra to free two British commandos detained earlier in the day by Iraqi police, witnesses and Iraqi officials said. An Iraqi official said a half-dozen armored vehicles had smashed into the jail, the Reuters news agency reported. The provincial governor, Mohammed Walli, told news agencies that the British assault was "barbaric, savage and irresponsible."

White House denies that God told Bush to invade Iraq
Nabil Shaath said he and other world leaders at a Jordan summit two years ago did not believe Mr Bush thought God had given him a personal message. Mr Bush's spokesman said the original allegation, which will appear in a BBC documentary next week, was absurd. Scott McClellan said the comments had never been made. The comments were attributed to Mr Bush by Mr Shaath, a Palestinian negotiator, in the upcoming TV series Elusive Peace: Israel and the Arabs. Mr Shaath said that in a 2003 meeting with Mr Bush, the US president said he was "driven with a mission from God". "God would tell me, George, go and fight those terrorists in Afghanistan. And I did, and then God would tell me, George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq... And I did. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who attended the meeting in June 2003 too, also appears on the documentary series to recount how Mr Bush told him: "I have a moral and religious obligation. "President Bush said that God guided him in what he should do, and this guidance led him to go to Afghanistan to rid it of terrorism after 9/11 and led him to Iraq to fight tyranny," he said.

Strong earthquake hits Pakistan, north India, Afghanistan
Rescuers are working against time to reach the injured Search for survivors More than 42,000 people are believed to be injured, said the interior minister. The death toll in Indian-administered Kashmir has risen to more than 550, after the bodies of 250 people were found in one town alone. Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has appealed for greater international help in the relief effort.

Chinese activist severely beaten by "mob"
In the report below, we said that Lu Banglie was so injured in the beating that "his eye [lay] out of its socket" and "the ligaments in his neck were broken". Subsequent reports have made it clear that Mr Lu's injuries were not as serious as had been stated. In particular, a report headed Chinese activist vows to continue, despite beating , printed on October 12, stated, after an interview with Mr Lu, "Although he was in pain from his neck, it was not broken and his eye did not come out of its socket." The readers' editor will write about this in his column on October 17.The last time I saw Lu Banglie, he was lying in a ditch on the side of the street - placid, numb and lifeless - the spit, snot and urine of about 20 men mixing with his blood, and running all over his body. I had only met him that day. The day I arrived a French radio journalist and a Hong Kong print journalist were rumoured to have been beaten somewhere around Taishi. The Taishi election had also been scheduled for that very day, and news of a hunger strike by one of the two most famous figures in Taishi had just come out. Born as a peasant in Baoyuesi village of Bailizhou town in Zhijiang city in Hubei province, he was a people's representative and had been in the village of Taishi since the start of a democratic movement in the area. That movement, deeply unpopular with the local authorities, has come to be seen as a weather vane for China's tentative steps toward a more representative society. It has led to beatings and mass arrests among its population as well as for observers who ventured into its environs.

Gunmen, police clash in south Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria
Troops are hunting down those who carried out Thursday's attacks Authorities say that 61 rebels have been killed, but 12 police and 12 civilians also died in the assault on Nalchik in Kabardino-Balkaria province. Officials say militants are holding hostages at a police station in the city, which has been sealed off. Militants from nearby Chechnya are believed to be behind the attacks. The raid is the latest in a series of disturbances that have been destabilising Russia's North Caucasus for more than a year. Nalchik is about 100 km (60 miles) north-west of Beslan, where Chechen rebels took hundreds of hostages at a school in 2004, in an attack claimed by warlord Shamil Basayev. 'Find the bandits' Dozens of men armed with rocket launchers are said to have been involved in the fighting which broke out early on Thursday. The BBC's Emma Simpson in Moscow says this appears to have been an all-out attack on Nalchik's law enforcement and security services. A local Interior Ministry source told Itar-Tass that rebels launched a "carefully planned" simultaneous attack on police stations, security forces, military and drugs-control offices and the airport. "All hell broke loose, and the impression was that there was shooting everywhere," a resident told Reuters news agency. Deputy Interior Minister Andrei Novikov told reporters that 61 militants had been killed.

Iraq counting ballots
Sunni-led insurgents killed 19 people in Iraq on Wednesday, the opening day of Saddam Hussein’s trial , including six Shiites who were lined up at a factory and gunned down in front of their fellow workers, police said. The day’s fatalities also included three election commission officials who were shot and killed on the outskirts of the capital in Abu Ghraib, as they drove home after another round of counting ballots from last weekend’s constitutional referendum, police said. A bomb also went off at a famous monument in a Baghdad square honoring the 8th-century founder of Baghdad to whom Saddam often compared himself. The blast, which toppled the bust of Abu Jaafar Al-Mansour but caused no injuries, appeared to be a jab at the former dictator. In addition, the military said that two coalition soldiers were killed — one American, the other British — in attacks Tuesday night. Iraqis are still awaiting the outcome of last weekend’s referendum, as the slower-than-expected vote counting continued. Questions about the integrity of the vote and delays in getting marked ballots to the capital mean final results from the landmark vote won’t be announced until Friday at the earliest, officials said. The returns have raised questions over the possibility of irregularities in the balloting — and have prompted an audit into an irregularly high number of “yes” votes. An argumentative Saddam and seven senior members of his regime went on trial Wednesday for a 1982 massacre of about 150 Shiites in the town of Dujail, north of Baghdad. In Washington, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice heralded the constitutional referendum and said the U.S. strategy in Iraq was to “clear areas from insurgent control, hold them securely, and build durable, national Iraqi institutions.” Rice told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the United States is working to dismantle the insurgent network and disrupt foreign support for them, maintain security in areas insurgents no longer hold, and build national institutions to “sustain security forces, bring rule of law, visibly deliver essential services, and offer the Iraqi people hope for a better economic future.” Brutal attack in ‘Triangle of Death’ Wednesday’s worst insurgent attack occurred in a mostly Sunni region south of Baghdad known as the Triangle of Death because of all its militant groups. About nine militants barged into a building materials factory near Iskandariyah, 30 miles south of Baghdad, lined up all the workers and forced the six Shiite ones to identify themselves, said police Lt.

Mr Blunkett quit after breaking the ministerial code of conduct over paid work he took while out of the Cabinet. Michael Howard said the events showed a "haemorrhage" of Mr Blair's authority.

Sony faces class action lawsuits for DRM
The CDs affected in the US include Natasha Bedingfield's Unwritten In late October Sony was found to be using stealth techniques to hide software that stopped some of its CDs being illegally copied. Now three virus variants have been found that use the Sony software to evade detection by anti-virus programs. Sony has apologised, saying it is working with computer security firms to address the problems. Viral trio The stealthy methods that Sony BMG used to protect its anti-piracy system were uncovered by Windows programming expert Mark Russinovich on 31 October. It was already getting bad press about its copy-protection software, and this new hack exploit will make it even worse Graham Cluley, Sophos XCP uses these techniques to install a proprietary media player that allows PC users to play music on the 20 CDs Sony BMG is protecting with this system. The CDs affected are only being sold in the US. Soon after Mr Russinovich exposed how XCP worked security experts speculated that it would be easy to hijack the anti-piracy system to hide viruses. Now anti-virus companies have discovered three malicious programs that use XCP's stealthy capabilities if they find it installed on a compromised PC. "The development we feared most from Sony's inclusion of rootkit technology to conceal its DRM software was its use to conceal malicious code," said David Emm from security firm Kaspersky Labs. "Unfortunately, it seems our fears were well-grounded." Backdoor virus Security firm Sophos said it had found a virus attached to a spam message posing as an e-mail from a British business magazine.

Coal mine floods in northern China: 12,000 mines ordered to close
SHIJIAZHUANG, Nov. 20 (Xinhuanet) -- Seven miners were killed in acoal mine flooding accident which took place on early Saturday in north China's Hebei Province while seven others are still missing as of Sunday morning, local government source said. The source said the tragedy occurred at 5:00 a.m. Saturday in Yuanda Coal Mine in Xingtai City, trapping 14 miners underground. Rescue operation started quickly after the accident, and by 7 a.m. Sunday, the bodies of seven miners were found and retrieved but the whereabouts of the seven others remain unknown. Owners of the coal mine have already been detained by local police and the investigation into the cause of the flooding is underway. SHIJIAZHUANG, Nov. 19 (Xinhuanet) -- A coal mine flood early on Saturday has trapped 14 people in north China's Hebei Province and rescue work is going on, the local work safety supervision bureau said. A spokesman with the bureau said Yuanda Coal Mine, a collectively-owned mine in Neiqiu county of Xingtai, was flooded at around 5:00 a.m. and all the 14 miners working down the pit were trapped. Yuanda coal mine reports an annual output of 60,000 tons. This is the second fatal mine accidents in Xingtai in two weeks. BEIJING, Nov. 20 (Xinhuanet) -- A committee for safe production under the State Council, or the Chinese central government, on Sunday urged the relevant local governments to go all out to streamline the operation of mines and close unqualified ones. More than 12,000 Chinese mines have been ordered to suspend production, and they will be closed if they fail to pass government assessments at the end of this year, the committee said.

Chinese chemical plant explosion threatens water supply for major city
Panic was today spreading in Harbin, with officials preparing to cut off water supplies as heavily polluted river water flowed towards the Chinese city. Stockpiling began afresh at midnight when the local government switched taps on again for 12 hours after having cut off supplies to almost four million people yesterday. The temporary switch-on came after revised calculations showed the pollution would not reach Harbin until early tomorrow morning. "As the exact time of the pollutants flowing to the city's drinking water intake spot has been confirmed, we hoped that citizens could take time to hoard as much water as possible ahead of the water cut-off," an executive from the Harbin water company said. Residents were storing water supplies in bathtubs and buckets ahead of the expected three-day drought. Supermarkets reported panic buying of water, milk and soft drinks, while Harbin's airport and railway station were jammed with people fleeing the area. The provincial government was also trucking in water from neighbouring areas, testing little-used local wells and demanding 1,400 tonnes of activated charcoal to purify the water intake after the pollution had passed through the city. The city, in China's icy north-eastern Heilongjiang province, has a population of 3.8 million and draws most of its water from the Songhua. The river has been contaminated with more than 30 times the usual levels of benzene after an explosion at a chemical plant on its banks. Short-term exposure to the chemical in drinking water can cause long-term damage to the nervous system, while long-term exposure can result in cancer and leukaemia.

Further details about Bush-Blair memo stopped
The National Union of Journalists today accused the government of a "double attack on the freedom of the press and freedom of information" after it issued a reminder to editors about the provisions of the Official Secrets Act. The attorney general threatened newspapers with the act and the Contempt of Court Act in the context of an allegedly leaked memo, relating to a dispute between Tony Blair and George Bush over the conduct of military operations in Iraq. This intervention by the attorney general followed the publication of a front page story in the Daily Mirror yesterday under the headline "Bush plot to bomb his ally", in which the paper claimed the memo revealed that the US president last year planned to attack the Qatar headquarters of Arabic news broadcaster al-Jazeera. "This is a heavy-handed attempt to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. "These sort of attempts to stifle uncomfortable revelations printed in a newspaper, which is only carrying out its proper duty to inform the British public, does the government of what is supposed to be a democracy no credit whatsoever. "What we need in this country is free and open debate and a proper political dialogue over important issues of this sort, not a knee-jerk panic reaction." The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, warned that publication of further details from the document would be a breach under section five of the Official Secrets Act. In its news story on the attorney general's warning today, the Daily Mirror said it had "essentially agreed to comply". The Daily Mirror report was attributed to two anonymous sources describing a classified document they said contained a transcript of the two leaders' talk. One source is quoted as saying Bush's alleged remark concerning the network's headquarters in Qatar was "humorous, not serious," while the other said, "Bush was deadly serious." But, the diplomat said, "it was foolish for someone to write it down, and now it will be a story for days."

President Bush of the United States authorized NSA surveillance of citizens, bypassing court warrants
Congressional leaders of both parties called for hearings and issued condemnations yesterday in the wake of reports that President Bush signed a secret order in 2002 allowing the National Security Agency to spy on hundreds of U.S. citizens and other residents without court-approved warrants. Bush declined to discuss the domestic eavesdropping program in a television interview, but he joined his aides in saying that the government acted lawfully and did not intrude on citizens' rights. "Decisions made are made understanding we have an obligation to protect the civil liberties of the American people," Bush said on "The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer." Disclosure of the NSA plan had an immediate effect on Capitol Hill, where Democratic senators and a handful of Republicans derailed a bill that would renew expiring portions of the USA Patriot Act anti-terrorism law. Opponents repeatedly cited the previously unknown NSA program as an example of the kinds of government abuses that concerned them, while the GOP chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said he would hold oversight hearings on the issue. "There is no doubt that this is inappropriate," said Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who favored the Patriot Act renewal but said the NSA issue provided valuable ammunition for its opponents. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a member of the intelligence and judiciary committees, called the program "the most significant thing I have heard in my 12 years" in the Senate and suggested that the president may have broken the law by authorizing surveillance without proper warrants. "How can I go out, how can any member of this body go out, and say that under the Patriot Act we protect the rights of American citizens if, in fact, the president is not going to be bound by the law?" she asked.

Israeli PM Sharon rushed to hospital
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was transferred to intensive care after seven hours of surgery, and his vital signs are stable, the director of Hadassah Hospital said Thursday. The director, Shlomo Mor-Yosef, said Sharon remains in serious condition. "The prime minister has had a CT scan that showed the cerebral hemorrhaging has stopped," Mor-Yosef said. "The prime minister is now being transferred to the neurosurgical intensive care unit. In the unit, he will be treated, observed and cared for." "At this point, all the vital signs are ... stable. The prime minister is still in serious condition," the director said. Sharon fell ill at his ranch Wednesday evening and was rushed to Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where he was diagnosed with a cerebral hemorrhage. Doctors began emergency surgery about midnight to stop "massive, wide-spread bleeding" in his brain. Surgery apparently had been complicated by blood thinners he had been given following a mild stroke on Dec. 18, and the medication may also have contributed to Wednesday's stroke. Mor-Yosef did not address Sharon's prognosis, but neurosurgeons not involved in Sharon's treatment said a full recovery was not likely following such a massive stroke. They said it usually takes at least a day after the surgery to determine the extent of any damage. The session was convened to send a message of stability and continuity to the Israeli people, one government minister said.

U.S. airstrike targeting Ayman al-Zawahiri leaves 18 dead in Pakistani village
Sources: Airstrike may have killed bin Laden's No. 2 From David Ensor CNN Intelligence suggests that Ayman al-Zawahiri, seen in this September video, may have been killed. RELATED (CNN) -- Ayman al-Zawahiri -- Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in the al Qaeda terrorist network -- was the target of a CIA airstrike Friday in a remote Pakistani village and may have been among those killed, knowledgeable U.S. sources told CNN. There has been no confirmation that al-Zawahiri was killed in the attack, which took place in the village of Damadola, near the Afghan border. However, the sources said there was intelligence suggesting he was in one of the buildings hit during the strike. (Watch how al-Zawahiri was targeted -- 5:39) Pakistani officials were at the scene, trying to determine if al-Zawahiri was killed, the U.S. sources told CNN. Contacted by CNN, Pakistan's information minister could not confirm that al-Zawahiri had been the target of a CIA strike. Eighteen people died in Friday morning's strike -- eight men, five women and five children, Pakistani intelligence sources said. "We are conducting tests to identify the bodies," a Pakistani intelligence official told CNN. The strike came a week after the Arabic language news network Al-Jazeera aired a new videotape with a message from al-Zawahiri, in which he called on U.S. President George W. Bush to admit defeat in Iraq. He has also been indicted in the United States for his alleged role in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The U.S. government has put up a $25 million reward for information leading to his capture.

Venezuela will buy Spanish planes with European technology
¡¡CARACAS, Jan. 13 (Xinhuanet) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Friday denounced an attempt by the United States to block Spain from selling 12 military planes equipped with U.S. parts to Venezuela. Washington's refusal to allow Venezuela to buy Spanish-built planes which use some U.S. technology is "an imperialist outrage", Chavez told the National Assembly on Friday. I must denounce once again the imperialist outrage against the government and people of Venezuela," Chavez said at the opening of the Assembly. The United States refused permission, requested by Spanish consortium EADS-CASA, to sell 12 warplanes to Venezuela, saying that what Venezuela had said and done contributed to regional instability. The U.S. embassy in Spain said that it hoped the refusal would not harm the "excellent relations" the Bush administration has with Spain. Spain decided in early last November to go ahead with a plan tosell military planes and patrol crafts with a combined value of 2 billion U.S. dollars to Venezuela despite U.S. opposition. The country said on Friday that it will replace U.S. made components with parts made elsewhere, adding that the planes will be used for transport rather than for battling ends. Chavez said that the Venezuelan air force was also having a problem with buying training aircraft from Brazil. The Venezuelan government has been trying to buy Super Tucano fighter planes made by Brazil, but the purchase has also been blocked by Washington as the planes contain U.S. motor technology.

Gore criticizes use of unwarranted domestic wiretaps
In December, The New York Times reported that, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans and others in the country without obtaining the warrants typically required for domestic surveillance. The revelation of the wiretapping has led to calls for an independent investigation by Democrats, and some Republicans. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bush administration officials have defended the surveillance and said the president's power to authorize it comes from a Congressional resolution endorsing the war against terrorism enacted soon after the attacks. The administration has launched an investigation into who leaked details of the spying, saying the disclosure threatens national security. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Al Jazeera airs new Osama Bin Laden tape
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (Xinhuanet) -- Analysts at the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) believed that the voice on a tape, aired earlier Thursday by Arab television station Al Jazeera, was that of Osama bin Laden, an agency official said. The official, speaking anonymously, said that following technical analysis, the CIA determined that the voice on the tape was that of bin Laden, chief of the al Qaeda terrorist organization. Bin Laden warned in the tape that attacks were under preparations against the United States and its allies, and offered a truce in response to U.S. public opinion favoring withdrawal American troops from Iraq. "We don't mind offering you a long-term truce on fair conditions that we adhere to," he said in the tape. He said both sides could "enjoy security and stability under this truce so we can build Iraq and Afghanistan, which have been destroyed in this war." Speaking on the Fox News channel, Vice President Dick Cheney said he believed the truce offer was a ploy and that it was too early to draw any conclusions. "I'm not sure what he's offering by way of a truce. It sounds to me like it's some kind of a ploy, but again not having seen the entire text or validated the tape and the timing of it, I'm reluctant to draw any conclusions," he said. At a luncheon speech in New York on Thursday, Cheney warned that the United States still faced significant threats from terrorists attempting to establish a radical Islamic empire. We do not negotiate with terrorists, we put them out of business," he said.

Whale spotted in river Thames, Central London
The animal was spotted as it passed the Houses of Parliament The 16-18ft (5m) northern bottle-nosed whale, which is usually found in deep sea waters, has been seen as far upstream as Chelsea. A rescue boat has been sent to protect the whale and rescuers have been trying to keep it away from the river banks. The whale has come within yards of the banks and has crashed into an empty boat causing slight bleeding. The last thing we want to do is stress the animal out Liz Sandeman Marine Connection Watch the whale Whale in pictures Vets are remaining on standby and experts have said it does not appear to be ill, but are concerned it will get weaker and may become beached. He said if attempts to re-direct the whale downstream failed, it might be necessary to put it down to prevent from suffering further. A spokesman said three whales were spotted east of the Thames Barrier on Thursday but only one managed to get upstream. She told the BBC News website: "This is extremely rare in British waters as they are normally found in deep waters in the North Atlantic.

Message in bottle travels from UK to Australia
AM - Saturday, 21 January , 2006 08:28:00 Reporter: Kerrie Ritchie TONI HASSAN: When a young British girl put a message in a bottle last year and threw it into the ocean off the west coast of England she hoped she'd hear back from someone. Last week, almost six months later, an envelope arrived at her kindergarten. But when staff opened it, they were shocked to find it had been sent by a 10-year-old boy named Bob, who had found the bottle 14,500 kilometres away in Perth. KERRI RITCHIE: In July last year, as part of a kindergarten project, four-year-old Alesha Johnson drew a picture of herself, and wrote next to it "Hello, if you get this message please write back". She included the address of her kindergarten in the coastal town of Heysham and put the piece of paper inside a bottle. With the help of her mum she sealed it up and threw it in the Irish Sea at Morecambe Bay on England's north-west coast. For six months Alesha Johnson didn't hear a thing, but then last week a letter was delivered to her kindergarten with her name on it. DOREEN JOHNSON: I thought it's rather strange that a child of four was getting a letter with just a first name and nobody you know, and not a home address or anything. I thought perhaps one of the aunties or uncles had done it for her, you know, and popped it in.

Maryland Judge throws out law banning gay marriages
A Baltimore Circuit Court ruling yesterday struck down as discriminatory and unconstitutional a 1973 law outlawing same-sex marriage. The opinion set off a cascade of actions in all branches of state government. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R) wrote a letter to Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. (D) advising him to appeal the decision and offering additional resources to support the effort. "We have noted an appeal and think it appropriate that the court stayed the operation of its order," Kevin J. Enright, a spokesman for Curran, said in a statement. "We await having the decision of Maryland's appellate courts." · House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) said the House of Delegates set aside Jan. 31 for hearings in the Judiciary Committee on proposals dealing with same-sex marriage, including a proposed constitutional amendment. · The Maryland Court of Appeals will signal whether it will take up the case directly or wait for the mid-level appellate court to rule. BALTIMORE — A Maryland Circuit Court judge sided with nine gay couples Friday, ruling that the state's law defining marriage as being between a man and a woman violates the state's constitution. It is the latest decision in an intense national debate over the rights of gays and lesbians to marry. The ruling in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City will not make Maryland gay couples immediately eligible for marriage licenses, however. Judge M. Brooke Murdock stayed the order pending an appeal, which the state attorney general's office filed right away. "Although tradition and societal values are important, they cannot be given so much weight that they alone will justify a discriminatory statutory classification," the decision stated.

Burns engages India on civil nuclear energy pact
India must separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns made the remarks after two days of talks in the Indian capital, Delhi. Under the deal India would gain access to US civilian nuclear technology. Critics of the accord, which has to be ratified by the US Congress, fear it could harm non-proliferation efforts. "The situation is unique, India's position is unique and there is complexity and difficulty to these talks which is inherent in the subject," Mr Burns told journalists in Delhi. Correspondents say that may not be very easy as some of the country's major research facilities are thought to straddle both fields. Some US politicians and policymakers feel that making an exception in the case of India, which has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), would send a dangerous signal to non-proliferators, especially countries such as Iran. On Friday, Mr Burns described Iran as a threat to global peace and said it had "overstepped the limits of international law in seeking to pursue its nuclear ambitions". India wants to rid itself of US sanctions imposed in 1998 India, which voted against Iran at the IAEA last year, urged caution on both sides. "It stands to reason that India which has with Iran a very longstanding... relationship, would not like see a situation of confrontation developing in a region that is very close to India," Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran said. Indian and US officials have held several rounds of talks to resolve their differences especially ahead of the visit of US President George W Bush to India later this year.

U.S. army interrogator convicted in Iraqi general's death
A US army officer was guilty of negligent homicide in the death of an Iraqi general during an interrogation, a military court ruled on Saturday. Chief warrant officer Lewis Welshofer is the highest-ranking army officer tried on murder charges arising from the Bush administration's campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was found not guilty of murder and faces up to three years in prison when sentencing takes place today. The court heard that Welshofer caused the death of Major General Abed Hamed Mowhoush by putting him head-first into a sleeping bag, tying electrical cord around him, straddling him and covering his mouth. Welshofer was also found guilty of negligent dereliction of duty, which carries a sentence of up to three months. He was acquitted on charges of assault by a jury made up of army officers. Welshofer's lawyer, Frank Spinner, told reporters: "The verdict recognises the context in which these events took place. Prosecutors told the court that Welshofer had crossed a line and had not upheld the Geneva convention. "This case has been about our officer corps' need to maintain the high ground, especially in a country like Iraq where our presence may be resented," lead prosecutor Major Tiernan Dolan said. The defence argued that Welshofer was interpreting an email from superiors sent in August 2003, three months before Mowhoush died. The email, from Captain William Ponce, said: "The gloves are coming off, gentlemen ... we want these individuals broken.

Four Australian states ablaze, two dead, homes lost
The World Today - Monday, 23 January , 2006 12:30:00 Reporter: Daniel Hoare PETER CAVE: As fire-fighters across much of southern Australia continue fighting a number of blazes, the extent of the damage caused by yesterday's fires in Victoria is beginning to emerge. At least seven homes have been lost there and two bodies have been discovered after a car crash in a burnt-out area in the state's northwest. Fire-fighters in four states are trying to extinguish a number of blazes, the worst of which are in Victoria. The weather bureau says there'll be little respite for fire-fighters there, with conditions set to heat up again during the week, reaching more than 40 degrees on Thursday. And fire brigades are on standby in southern New South Wales as the hot conditions move north along the coast. About 170 fires are still burning in Victoria and there are also fires in South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia. DANIEL HOARE: Victoria has borne the brunt of the bushfires, which have destroyed at least seven homes across the state. Authorities haven't confirmed whether or not the deaths were a direct result of the fires, but the bodies were found in the car's wreckage in a burnt-out area. Fires have also destroyed sheds and vehicles and killed livestock in a number of areas of Victoria. In Western Australia, the efforts of fire-fighters battling a blaze in the state's south-west are being hampered by hot, gusty winds. The fire started on a blue gum plantation near the town of Dwellingup yesterday. In South Australia, fire-fighters are predicting worsening bushfire conditions as they fight blazes at the Ngarkat Conservation Park in the state's south-east, and on Kangaroo Island. In Tasmania, fire-fighters have had more luck, containing most of the 20 fires which were burning across the state yesterday.

Tensions continue to rise in Middle East over "Mohammad Cartoons"
Muslim protesters infuriated by cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad raised the diplomatic stakes last night as Iran's best-selling newspaper announced it would retaliate by running images satirising the Holocaust. The decision by the rightwing Hamshari daily to launch an international competition to find the most suitable caricatures came as demonstrators hurled firebombs and stones at the Danish embassy in Tehran and the Iranian government imposed a formal trade ban on Danish imports. In London, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, branded the activities of Islamist protesters outside the Danish embassy last week as "unacceptable". He told MPs he was pleased the response to the publication of the Danish cartoons had "in general been respectful and restrained in the best traditions of British tolerance". Scotland Yard has set up a special squad to investigate the demonstrations and the placards on display which called for the death of those who "insult Islam". The inquiry will examine everything from video recordings made by officers to photographs published in newspapers. One protester, who was photographed apparently dressed like a suicide bomber, apologised "wholeheartedly" yesterday. Omar Khayam, 22, appeared outside his house in Bedford accompanied by the chairman of his local mosque and his local MP. He said he had not intended to cause offence to the victims of the July 7 London bombings or their relatives but added that his protest remained valid because of the hurt caused to Muslims by the publication of the Danish cartoons. My method of protest has offended many people, especially the families of the victims of the July bombings.

Egyptian passenger ferry sinks in Red Sea
Most of 1,400 on Egypt ferry feared lost (AP/Reuters) Updated: 2006-02-04 08:26 An aging ferry sank in the choppy waters of the Red Sea on Friday with more than 1,400 people on board, mainly Egyptian workers returning from Saudi Arabia. Most were feared lost but officials said at least 314 made it to safety. A spokesman for President Hosni Mubarak said the ferry did not have enough lifeboats, and questions were raised about the safety of the 35-year-old, refitted ship that was weighed down with 220 cars as well as the passengers. "It's a roll-on, roll-off ferry, and there is big question mark over the stability of this kind of ship," said David Osler of the London shipping paper Lloyds List. "It would only take a bit of water to get on board this ship and it would be all over. One lifeboat was spotted from a helicopter during the day bobbing in the waves with what appeared to be about a dozen or more passengers. This is an aerial image from TV which shows people in a dinghy in the Red Sea, Friday, Feb. 3, 2006. [AP]  Hundreds of angry relatives of the passengers crowded for hours outside Egypt's port of Safaga, where the ferry had been heading. "This is a dirty government, may God burn their hearts as they burned mine," one woman wailed, slapping her face in grief.

New Zealand newspapers publish "Mohammad Cartoons"
A renowned New Zealand cartoonist has stepped into the controversy surrounding the publishing of Muslim caricatures in newspapers around the globe. Tom Scott, who in 1969 faced a blasphemy prosecution for an anti-Christian cartoon, said the Islamic community needed to get a sense of humour. "(They) clearly have god on their side so they don't need cartoonists as well," he added. Mr Scott said he was sorry his original blasphemy charge had not gone to court as his defence team "was going to subpoena god". A number of European newspapers recently re-published the Muslim caricatures, first published by a Danish newspaper in September, triggering outrage and protests in some Muslim countries. Two Fairfax papers - The Dominion Post in Wellington and The Press in Christchurch -- yesterday followed suit, despite the outrage they have caused in the Muslim world. A New Zealand Muslim leader yesterday called on The Dominion Post to apologise for its irresponsible and hurtful act in publishing "disrespectful" cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad. Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand president Javed Khan said he was deeply saddened and that The Dominion Post should have known better. "In the name of freedom of expression the media has taken this matter to the extreme," he said. "Freedom of expression does not mean 'absolute' freedom, going as far as mocking other religions and their beliefs. Mr Khan said he hoped The Dominion Post editor Tim Pankhurst, also chair of the Commonwealth Press Union, would "realise the serious implications and damage the paper has caused by such an irresponsible, insensitive and hurtful act against the Muslims."

Neil Entwistle faces two counts of murder, one count of illegal possession of a firearm and one count of illegal possession of ammunition, said Melissa Sherman of the Middlesex County, Massachusetts, district attorney's office. If convicted, he could face life in prison without parole. Massachusetts does not have the death penalty. (Watch the alleged trail of the gun and the suspect -- 3:37) At a magistrate court appearance a few hours later, he acknowledged the charges against him and said he did not consent to extradition to the United States. Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley said authorities believe Entwistle's wife, Rachel, and their 9-month-old baby, Lillian, were shot sometime during the morning of January 20 at their home in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. "There's no indication in the past of trouble," said Coakley, describing the picture investigators got of "a young couple starting out on a happy future." A spokesman for Rachel Entwistle's family said members were "shocked by the news" of the charges against her husband. Neil was a trusted husband and father, and it is incomprehensible how that love and trust was betrayed in the ultimate act of violence," Joe Flaherty read from the family's statement. Flaherty said the family was "always confident that the case would be solved and those responsible would be brought to justice." (Watch family spokesman tell of their heartbreak -- 2:20) There's not a clear-cut motive for the killings, but the investigation did turn up some "financial difficulty," Coakley said.

BNP lose council seat in Keighley
Labour's Angela Sinfield won the Keighley West seat with a majority of 603 after its BNP councillor Angela Clark stood down last month.

The BNP need to get the message that they are not welcome in Keighley and need to leave." BNP spokesman Dr Phil Edwards said: "This is by no means a disastrous result and does not mean we are not welcome in Keighley. "We have secured nearly a third of the votes, which is still a good result." In last year's general election, party leader Nick Griffin chose to stand in Keighley but received only 9% of the vote.

Tom DeLay will not seek re-election; to resign from Congress
FREE PREVIEW DeLay Won't Run For Re-Election To House Seat Word Count: 355 WASHINGTON -- Rep. Tom DeLay (R., Texas), once one of the most powerful Republicans on Capitol Hill, won't seek another term in Congress, former aides of Mr. DeLay and current House Republican leaders said last night. Mr. DeLay announced earlier this year that he wouldn't try to run for another term in the Republican leadership after he became the center of two separate investigations. Tom DeLay, the Texas republican representative and former House Majority Leader, and his wife, Christine, sat down at their kitchen table in Sugar Land, Texas, on Monday with TIME White House correspondent Mike Allen to explain DeLay's decision not to seek reelection, and to give up his Congressional seat in the next few months. TIME: Thank you for sitting down with TIME. I understand you're going to be making an announcement soon. DeLay: After the primary [March 7], I started looking atreevaluating the primaryevaluating what the general election was going to be, looking at the landscape. I spent a lot of time talking to friends and people I have respect for and staffChristine and I every day discussing what the future holds. And I'm very proud of my record and I feel very strongly about what the 22nd District that I represent deserves.

Swan in Fife, Scotland dies with H5N1 bird flu virus infection
More birds, including swans, are being tested The ex-head of the British Veterinary Association, Dr Bob McCracken, said he found it "difficult to accept" there would not be more cases. But Dr McCracken said that did not mean it was certain the virus would spread to poultry. He also advised poultry owners to keep birds indoors if possible. Seagulls Fourteen other birds, including 12 swans, are currently being tested by experts to see if they have the virus. I would start from the assumption that a small pool if wild birds in the Fife area are infected Dr Bob McCracken, British Veterinary Association Experts think there will be other positive cases, particularly because the initial case was in a mute swan, which is native to the UK, rather than a migratory species. Dr McCracken said: "I would start from the assumption that a small pool if wild birds in the Fife area are infected and potentially passing it on to other birds." "I don't think for a minute that will be the situation." Dr McCracken also warned that seagulls, who are known to have been pecking at the carcass of the dead bird, could also be infected. But he said measures - most significantly keeping birds indoors - would protect domestic flocks from becoming infected.

Blair, Ahern unveil plan for Northern Ireland devolution
President Bush has urged politicians to give leadership His comments came after the British and Irish prime ministers unveiled a blueprint for reviving devolution. Assembly members have been given until 24 November to set up an executive. In a statement from the White House, Mr Bush urged politicians to "demonstrate leadership" to resolve the outstanding issues. "Today is an opportunity for all in Northern Ireland to take control of their future and bring the political process to a successful completion this year," the White House said on Thursday evening. "President Bush calls on all parties to demonstrate leadership and seize this opportunity to work together to restore the power-sharing government and resolve outstanding issues.

Mr Ahern has acknowledged the difficulties facing himself and Mr Blair were compounded by the murder of ex-Sinn Fein official and former British spy Denis Donaldson in County Donegal. Mr Blair said it was "a moment to let the process be governed, not by suspicion but by the faith that the other does want this to succeed."

Tory chairman Francis Maude called it a "good" result. But opponents said the Tories had failed in northern cities. 'Change and optimism' Mr Maude said the result was "at the top end" of predictions, adding: "We are continuing to build our support while Labour's melts away. "David Cameron's message of change, optimism and hope is in tune with what Britain wants today." It was the Tories' best local election performance since they last won national power in 1992. Party leader David Cameron said: "There's plenty more to do, and plenty more change to be made and work to be done, but I think this is a very important step forward." The party's win in Crawley stripped Labour of control of the town for the first time since the early 1970s. And the Tories picked up Ealing from Labour in what is seen as a "bellweather seat" for general election prospects.

Darfur rebel leader signs peace plan
The breakthrough came when SLM leader Minni Minnawi returned to the talks, following a late-night session. However, two smaller groups rejected the deal, following last-minute efforts to secure their support. The government has also agreed to sign. International negotiators say the deal is the best hope for peace in Darfur, where 2m people have fled their homes. The BBC's Alex Last, who is at the talks in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, says a huge round of applause was heard shortly after Mr Minnawi returned to the talks. "I accept the document with some reservations concerning the power sharing," Mr Minnawi said. DARFUR DRAFT PEACE PLAN Pro-government Janjaweed militia to be disarmed Rebel fighters to be incorporated into army One-off transfer of $300m to Darfur $200m a year for the region thereafter Compensation for those forced to flee their homes Regional government, if approved in a vote Q&A: Darfur crisis Have Your Say: Darfur crisis One of his officials told the Reuters news agency that the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLM) wanted more seats in parliament but had agreed to the deal to end the suffering of the people in Darfur. Meanwhile, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour has accused Sudan's government of offering "broad immunity" to members of the security forces involved in the Darfur violence and trying to minimise the scale of the problems. In Abuja, government spokesman Abdulrahman Zuma looked forward to the end of the fighting. "The deal is peace - I think that the victory today is for Sudan," he said. However, a signing ceremony was delayed for three hours, as mediators try to persuade Abdelwahid Muhamed El Nur, leader of the smaller SLM faction, to sign up to the deal. Our correspondent says there are doubts as to whether the plan is workable, but the mediators are counting on the fact that they have managed to get the support of the largest rebel group. 'Misgivings' Sam Ibok, head of the AU mediation team, said the government thought the plan envisaged too many rebel fighters being integrated into the army. About two million people have been displaced The smallest rebel group, the Justice and Equality Movement (Jem), insisted that it wanted fundamental changes to the document.

Sudan will welcome UN Peacekeepers in Darfur
Speaking from Darfur, Jan Egeland told the BBC there was a sea of militias in the region and without security the humanitarian work could not succeed. Mr Egeland is in Darfur, in western Sudan, to assess conditions there and in refugee camps in neighbouring Chad. He is to hold talks with the government in the capital, Khartoum, on Monday. The government and the biggest rebel group signed a peace deal on Friday. The agreement has raised hopes the government will allow UN peacekeepers to take over from African Union troops in the region. It has previously said it would only consider doing so if a peace deal was signed. Some 7,000 African Union troops are in the region - an area the size of France - but have struggled to contain the fighting.

He was speaking in the town of Gereida which is held by the rebel group which signed the peace deal, the Sudan Liberation Movement under Minni Minnawi. Tens of thousands of people around Gereida have been displaced in recent weeks, and the UN has warned of an impending disaster. Earlier, Mr Egeland held talks with the deputy governor of South Darfur in the town of Nyala and called for aid workers to be given unlimited access, as agreed in the peace deal.

Theo Walcott is the big surprise in Eriksson's preliminary World Cup squad
Jol thinks Defoe should be in the squad Jol said: "I think it is amazing that Jermain is not in the squad. "But with the situation with Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen's fitness I still believe he will be in there." Another Spurs player, defender Ledley King, missed out through injury and Jol added: "It is all about fitness and he just got his injury at the wrong time." But England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson says King could still make the World Cup finals despite failing to even make his standby list. King is unfit after breaking a bone in his foot in April. I wasn't taking anything for granted but I was very hopeful of being included Darren Bent "If he is better then he might become an option.

UK Attorney General says Guantanamo should close
The attorney general believes the camp should close He is reported to have serious doubts about whether the indefinite detention of "enemy combatants" is legal or fair. In a speech in London, he said the camp had become a symbol of injustice and its existence was "unacceptable". State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the US did not want to release people who might "end up on the battlefield" or commit terrorist acts. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has called the camp in Cuba an "anomaly". But in the strongest worded condemnation yet from a British government minister, Lord Goldsmith said: "The existence of Guantanamo remains unacceptable. The historic tradition of the United States as a beacon of freedom, liberty and of justice deserves the removal of this symbol Lord Goldsmith Transcript of speech in full Call shows 'significant shift' "It is time, in my view, that it should close. Not only would it, in my personal opinion, be right to close Guantanamo as a matter of principle, I believe it would also help to remove what has become a symbol to many - right or wrong - of injustice. "The historic tradition of the United States as a beacon of freedom, liberty and of justice deserves the removal of this symbol." Fair trial Lord Goldsmith told the Royal United Services Institute there was a case for limiting some rights for collective security. Fundamental rights must be protected if we are to preserve our democracies but given the current threat to our national security we have to be flexible Lord Goldsmith But he said the right to a fair trial should never be compromised. Lord Goldsmith said the UK was "unable to accept that the US military tribunals proposed for those detained at Guantanamo Bay offered sufficient guarantees of a fair trial in accordance with international standards".

USA Today reports NSA obtained call logs from communications companies
What author Malcolm Gladwell described as small things that make a big difference seems like an apt metaphor for the latest developments on civil liberties and the Bush administration. First was Thursday morning's story , declaring, "NSA Has Massive Database of Americans' Phone Calls." The story dominated the morning news shows and drove the day's events, with the President racing to the microphones in the Diplomatic Room of the White House before departing on a trip to Mississippi. Bush didn't get into the specifics of thestory, but he did defend the program, saying the federal government is not "mining or trolling through the personal lives of innocent Americans." To date, the Bush Administration has enjoyed public support for a slew of policies  including detentions without trials and new methods of eavesdropping  that critics describe as an encroachment on civil liberties. Last year, the Democrats tried to make renewal of the USA Patriot Act an issue, but in the end they buried their objections and passed a bill that Bush could sign. When the NSA's policy of warrantless eavesdropping on some domestic calls was revealed by The New York Times in December, Democrats along with many Republicans also screamed from the rafters, but the program proved popular with the public. Presidential advisers thought it was such a winner that they put it in Bush's State of the Union address. Despite calls to investigate the program and shut it down, what the White House dubs the "terrorist surveillance program" continued unabated. According to the story, the NSA is not actually listening in on the phone calls but monitoring the patterns of calls in a kind of giant Google search, with the hope that their algorithm will detect something untoward and worth investigating. But even if your call to Aunt Sally isn't being listened to by some NSA officer, the program sounds creepy enough that no shortage of senators jumped all over it. The Republican Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he'd subpoena the heads of the three telecommunications companies involved  AT&T, Verizon and BellSouth  before hearings to find out what they knew.

Finnish metal band win 51st Eurovision Song Contest
This hard rock band were already successful in their home country, but have now become a phenomenon in Europe. That is partly thanks to their gloriously over-the-top theatrics and stadium rock anthems. But they may also have captured the imaginations of those who wanted to register a protest vote against Eurovision's normal diet of plastic pop. Their fearsome appearance and religious references led to some protests in Finland and host country Greece before this year's contest. Lordi say they will never remove their masks And a group of Greek protesters known as the Hellenes called on the Finnish government to intervene. "We ask the Finnish Commission of the Eurovision Song Contest to cancel the procedure and choose another song," they said. But Lordi's lead singer, also known as Lordi, brushed aside the complaints, insisting: "We have nothing to do with satan worshipping or anything like that - this is entertainment." "The guys behind the masks are not interesting - they walk the dogs," he said. The band have become Finland's first Eurovision winners Now 32, Putaansuu started drawing monster designs on his face with his mother's make-up at the age of seven and was making horror films with his parents' video camera three years later. He graduated from film school and earned a living drawing storyboards, forming Lordi in 1992. They spent the first 10 years trying to get a record deal but their debut album Get Heavy went platinum in their home country in 2002 and their "greatest hits" compilation has been released in 20 countries.

British police shoot man in anti-terrorism raid
Police have cordoned off three roads in the area Residents' reactions The man, who was later arrested, was taken to hospital after the search in Forest Gate, east London. A 20-year-old man is also being held at a central London police station. A single shot was fired, according to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which will investigate. The operation was not linked to the London bombings of July 2005, police have said. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke, head of the Met's anti-terror branch, said the operation was planned in response to "specific intelligence". "Because of the very specific nature of the intelligence we planned an operation that was designed to mitigate any threat to the public either from firearms or from hazardous substances," he said. He said the purpose of the raid was to prove or disprove intelligence they had received. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford described it as the most significant anti-terror operation this year. Police officers in protective clothing have moved into the terraced house in Lansdown Road in what is being described as a "precautionary measure". The search of the premises is expected to take several days. A white and yellow tent has been set up outside the property, while workmen are erecting a two-storey high scaffolding screen around the building.

17 arrested in Canadian counter-terrorism operation
The arrest of 17people accused of planning attacks in southern Ontariotook on an international twist Saturday when theFBI said some Canadian suspects had been in contact with two men arrested by the U.S. on terrorism-related charges. The FBI said two men from Georgia visited Toronto last year and met at least three of the Canadians arrested late Friday night and accused of planning attacks in southern Ontario. FBI Special Agent Richard Kolko said U.S. authorities have been co-operating with Canadian police since the two Georgia men were arrested this spring on terrorism-related charges. The two were identified as Syed Ahmed, a 21-year-old student at the Georgia Institute for Technology and Ehsanul Sadequee, 19. A U.S. court affidavit said Ahmed and Sadequee travelled to Toronto in March 2005 to meet "like-minded Islamic extremists." It is believed they met with at least three Toronto residents to discuss training and tactics, leading to a major international investigation and the arrests on Friday. A U.S. affidavit obtained by Canadian Press quoted Ahmed as saying they"discussed strategic locations in the United States suitable for a terrorist strike, to include oil refineries and military bases. They also plotted how to disable the global positioning system in an effort to disrupt military and commercial communications and traffic." Sadequee was arrested in April in Bangladesh and is accused of making false statements in connection with a terrorism investigation.

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed in airstrike
BAGHDAD, June 9 -- Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was clinging to life when Iraqi and, later, American forces arrived at the scene of the bombing that killed him, a U.S. general said Friday, revising his earlier account of the al-Qaeda leader's death. Meanwhile, other circumstances surrounding the killing remained cloudy. Zarqawi was lying on a stretcher at the scene of the bombing, in a village about 35 miles north of Baghdad, when U.S. forces arrived Wednesday evening and tentatively identified him as the wanted insurgent leader. He mumbled something indistinguishable and tried to move but was restrained, according to Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad. "Everybody re-secured him back onto the stretcher, but he died almost immediately thereafter from the wounds he'd received from this airstrike," Caldwell said. A day earlier, when asked about reports that Zarqawi had somehow survived the blast from two 500-pound bombs dropped by Air Force fighter jets, Caldwell had told reporters, "He was dead when we arrived there." In a video briefing for Pentagon reporters Friday, Caldwell also slightly adjusted earlier reports of who was killed in the bombing, saying that in addition to Zarqawi and his spiritual adviser, Sheik Abdel Rahman, another man and three women were among the dead but not a child, as he had first said. Even as new details emerged, many questions remained about the events surrounding Zarqawi's death, perhaps the greatest triumph for U.S. forces in their bloody campaign against Iraq's three-year-old insurgency. "I do know that if in fact U.S. military or coalition forces feel that, in the execution of a target, that it's going to lead to exorbitant American or coalition forces losses, that we'll use proportional force rather than put young men and women's lives at risk," Caldwell said. When reporters asked Caldwell how anyone could have survived such a bombardment, Caldwell said Air Force experts had assured him that it was possible.

U.S. military tribunals in Guantanamo Bay lack Congressional authorization, violate U.S. law and Geneva Conventions
Adjust font size: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday strongly limited the power of the Bush administration to conduct military tribunals for suspected terrorists imprisoned at the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The 5-3 ruling means officials will have to come up with a new policy to prosecute at least 10 so-called "enemy combatants" awaiting trial. It does not address the government's right to detain suspects. The case was a major test of President Bush's authority as commander in chief during war. Officials said he has admitted being a personal assistant, bodyguard and driver to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. "The military commission at issue is not expressly authorized by any congressional act," said Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority. "In undertaking to try Hamdan and subject him to criminal punishment, the executive [Bush] is bound to comply with the rule of law that prevails in this jurisdiction," Stevens wrote. Breyer noted, however, that "nothing prevents the president from returning to Congress to seek the authority he believes necessary." "To the extent there is latitude to work with the Congress to determine whether or not the military tribunals will be an avenue in which to give people their day in court, we will do so," Bush said at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.

In an interview with the Egyptian newspaper al-Ahram, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said the Palestinian militant group Hamas had agreed to the conditional release of Cpl Gilad Shalit, who was captured on Sunday. "Up to now, the Israeli side does not accept," Mr Mubarak is quoted as saying, without giving details of the Palestinian conditions. 'All-out war' In the latest round of air strikes, Israeli warplanes fired missiles into the unoccupied Palestinian interior ministry in Gaza City shortly after midnight on Friday, setting the building ablaze.

At least 20 other targets included an office of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah group, militant training camps, a weapons storage facility in Gaza City and sites used by militants to fire rockets at Israel. "Israel is now waging an open-ended all-out war against the Palestinian people that aims to topple the Palestinian presidency and the Palestinian government, and act as though there is no Palestinian official or government," he told the BBC. There were also reports of heavy exchanges of fire between militants and an undercover Israeli force near the northern town of Jabaliya. Humanitarian fears Meanwhile, the UN's emergency relief co-ordinator Jan Egeland said that Gaza was on the brink of a humanitarian crisis after the destruction by the Israeli air force of the only power plant there on Tuesday night.

Portugal taken to penalties; beat England and reach historic semi-final
Ricardo was the hero for Portugal with three penalty saves England lost skipper David Beckham to injury just after half-time and Wayne Rooney was sent off after 62 minutes for a stamp on Ricardo Carvalho. They battled on bravely for the rest of normal time and extra-time with 10 men to take the game to a shoot-out. But Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher missed to end their hopes and Sven-Goran Eriksson's reign. The Swede leaves his post as England coach after going out at the quarter-final stage of a major tournament for the third time in succession and now hands over to Steve McClaren. Eriksson had promised a big performance from his side but until Rooney's early exit it was not forthcoming. The young striker endured a frustrating game and his patience finally snapped as he got tangled up with Carvalho and Armando Petit and appeared to aim a stamp at the Chelsea player's groin. Elizondo took a moment before sending Rooney from the field and with him seemingly went England's World Cup hopes. Portugal were far from their best but they at least caused some worrying moments at the back for England in a tense first half. Eriksson was forced to change things round six minutes into the second half with Beckham struggling with an ankle problem. Beckham almost won a penalty with his last contribution of the game - and probably his chances of winning a World Cup - when his cross hit the hand of Nuno Valente but England's appeals came to nothing. He was replaced by Aaron Lennon and was seen on the sidelines looking anguished as treatment was performed on his ankle, although he did later bear the pain long enough to berate the referee following Rooney's dismissal. Rooney saw red after 62 minutes for stamping on Carvalho Lennon's introduction gave England brief hope as his pace took him past two players, but when the ball fell for Rooney he almost completely missed and Joe Cole's effort was just too high.

The US called the tests "provocative", and urged a resumption of multilateral talks. Japan went on to announce a range of sanctions against Pyongyang. The ambassadors of the US, Japan and the UK said there had been widespread concern with not a single member of the council defending North Korea's actions. A draft resolution drawn up by Japan and the US is said to demand that Pyongyang immediately stop the development, testing and deployment of ballistic missiles. It also calls on member states to prevent the transfer of resources, items and technology that could contribute to North Korea's missile programme. Experts are beginning discussion on the document but there is no indication when it may be passed by the council. Tokyo - one of North Korea's harshest critics, and in easy reach of a long-range missile - has already said it will ban the entry of North Korean officials, chartered flights and a ferry.

US soldier arrested for rape and four murders in Iraq
Steven D. Green appeared in court on Monday in Charlotte, N.C., to face charges that he and other soldiers raped a young Iraqi woman. ((Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office/Associated Press)) Prosecutors in North Carolina have charged a formerU.S. army private with rape and murder after an investigation into the death of four civilians in Iraq last March. Steven D. Green appeared in court on Monday in Charlotte, N.C., to face charges that he raped a young Iraqi woman.He is also charged with killing the woman andthree members of her family to cover up the crime. The age of the victim is not known. While the FBI estimated her to be 25, a neighbour said she was 14. His honourable discharge from the army is not related to the crime, prosecutors said, but was "due to a personality disorder." His case is being handled in the civilian courts because he is no longer on active military duty. Conspiracy alleged The affidavit said Green and three fellow soldiers were posted to a traffic checkpoint in the town of Mahmoudiya —south of Baghdad —when they conspired to rape the young woman. Then, in a statement from one of the soldiers involved in the rape, the affidavit says Green took the woman and three members of her family to another room where he shot them dead.

Several blasts rock Mumbai commuter trains
Rescue efforts have been hampered by heavy rain The first of the near-simultaneous blasts went off at about 1830 local time (1300 GMT), during the rush hour in the suburbs on the Western Railway. Correspondents spoke of scenes of pandemonium, with people jumping from trains and bodies flung onto tracks. There have been a number of bomb attacks in Mumbai in recent years. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for calm and described the incidents as a "shocking and cowardly attempt to spread a feeling of hatred". Pakistani leaders also condemned the blasts as a "despicable act of terrorism". Police said the co-ordinated blasts took place at Matunga, Khar, Mahim, Jogeshwari, Borivali and Bhayandar, with most on moving trains and two at stations. A shopkeeper near one explosion said it was so powerful they thought they had been hit by lightning. Television images show dazed and bloodied commuters being carried by fellow passengers to waiting ambulances, as rescue workers clambered through wreckage to reach victims. The force of the blasts ripped doors and windows off carriages, and scattered luggage. An eyewitness at Mahim told the BBC some of those who had jumped from the train were run over by another train coming in the opposite direction. A medical student at a hospital in Parel, which has received many of the wounded, told the BBC News website the "floors are filled with bloodstains".

Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett dies at age 60
share tweet email A little bit of rock mythology died with Syd Barrett, the psychically damaged founding member of Pink Floyd who apparently succumbed to complications from diabetes last Friday at age 60.Every creative discipline has its unstable geniuses – poets, painters, actors. Some of them play the role to the hilt, with a mad leer and an arched eyebrow. Rock music, with its crazy energy and relentless search for the new, has always been an especially apt breeding ground for wayward types. Syd Barrett, a true manchild tuned to another frequency, created the mold. There were, to be sure, earlier examples of beguiling, irrational behavior in rock. Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis both earned their reputations by playing as if possessed. The British producer Joe Meek (“Telstar”) literally tried to record voices from beyond the grave, in cemeteries. But the psychedelic era brought a new strangeness to popular music, and Barrett was one of the most prominent early acid casualties. A key founding member of Pink Floyd, who gave the group its name (borrowed from the bluesmen Pink Anderson and Floyd Council) and wrote most of the band’s debut album, “The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,” Barrett was forced to quit by early 1968. After cobbling together two fragile but enduring solo albums, “The Madcap Laughs” and “Barrett” (both released in 1970), the frequently incoherent singer frittered away the rest of his years in his mum’s house in Cambridge, England. Occasionally spotted on long walks or errands to the corner store, he was the subject of much armchair speculation: Was he an undiagnosed schizophrenic? Did the drugs trigger a latent mental illness, or were they the sole cause of his incapacity?

Blair ally Lord Levy arrested
Lord Levy is a close friend of Tony Blair Lord Levy, 61, denies any wrongdoing and accused the police of using their arrest powers "totally unnecessarily". The peer was one of the key figures in the securing of multi-million pound loans to the Labour Party last year. Police are examining whether honours were ever given as reward for financial help to any of the three main parties. Critics of Mr Blair have seized on news of the arrest as Lord Levy is a close ally and tennis partner of the prime minister, as well as his Middle East envoy. Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond claimed the water was now "lapping around the prime minister's feet". 'No offence' Scotland Yard is conducting a wide-ranging investigation into loans and donations made to all three parties to see if there is any evidence that honours have been given as rewards for financial help. It is ludicrous for the prime minister to refuse to comment on the basis that this is a party matter Norman Baker Lib Dem MP Analysis: How bad for Blair? Lord Levy's spokesman said: "He has not been charged and does not expect to be, as he has committed no offence." His spokesman added: "Lord Levy has made it clear that he is ready at all times to co-operate with the police investigation. The prime minister's official spokesman said he could not comment on Lord Levy's arrest because it was a party, not a government, matter.

Psilocybin induces mystical and spiritual experiences: study
Psilocybin, the active ingredient of "magic mushrooms," expands the mind. After a thousand years of use, that's now scientifically official. The chemical promoted a mystical experience in two-thirds of people who took it for the first time, according to a new study. One-third rated a session with psilocybin as the "single most spiritually significant" experience of their lives. Another third put it in the top five. The study, published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology, is the first randomized, controlled trial of a substance used for centuries in Mexico and Central America to produce mystical insights. Almost no research on a psychedelic drug in human subjects has been done in this country since the 1960s. It confirms what both shamans and hippies have long said -- taking psilocybin is a scary, reality-bending and occasionally life-changing experience. The researchers say they hope the experiment opens a door to the study of a class of compounds that alter human perception and erode the boundaries of self -- at least in some users. They hope it will provide new insight into how the brain works and what neurochemical events underlie moments of mystical rapture. If the generally positive effects of the drug are confirmed by other studies, the research is likely to raise the question of whether people should be allowed access to psilocybin for self-improvement or recreation. Rigorous study of these substances has been shunned since the 1960s, although it is not legally prohibited. Research on them was a casualty of the muddled mix of science and advocacy by people like Timothy Leary, the LSD guru and former Harvard psychologist once called the "most dangerous man in America" by President Richard M. Nixon. "Our study has shown we can conduct a study of this type safely, and that the effects produced are really quite interesting," said Roland R. Griffiths of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who ran the experiment.

Day of attacks continue in Israel and Lebanon
Israeli warplanes hit Beirut suburb Israel attacks airports, major highway after Hezbollah lobs rockets QUICKVOTE Do you think the Israeli military response inside Lebanon is justified? Yes No or View Results YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Israel Lebanon or or Create Your Own JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israeli warplanes early Friday bombed southern Beirut, home to the offices of Hezbollah and the group's leader, as the Israeli-Lebanese violence that has killed dozens of Lebanese civilians and 10 Israelis entered its third day. Lebanese police said the planes hit the airport road, which crosses through the southern district considered a Hezbollah stronghold. A Lebanese army official said bombs also hit two bridges in the southern suburbs of the capital and a stadium. Earlier, Israel had dropped leaflets warning residents to stay away from the Hezbollah offices in southern Beirut, where Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah is thought to live. Rockets also landed in the northern port city of Haifa, which would mark the deepest point into Israel that Hezbollah rockets have ever reached, but Hezbollah denied that they fired the rockets. An Israeli diplomat called the rocket attacks "a major escalation" in the violence. Israeli airstrikes and artillery hammered hundreds of targets in Lebanon, including two strikes on the Beirut airport, where helicopter gunships left craters in runways and turned fuel tanks into fireballs. (Watch the strike on Beirut's airport -- :44) Israel said it targeted the airport because it is a transfer point for weapons and supplies to Hezbollah. Despite the fact that several countries -- including the Unites States and Lebanon -- have said that the Lebanese government doesn't have the capacity to extend its authority into Hezbollah-held territory, Israel has blamed the Lebanese government for the violence and charged it with the soldiers' safe release.

Israeli strikes are targeting Lebanese infrastructure Enlarge Image  Warplanes fired rockets on the Lebanon-Syrian border and hit the centre of Beirut for the first time. More than 80 Lebanese have died, including 18 fleeing border areas, in the strikes launched after Hezbollah militants seized two Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah launched rockets on the town of Tiberias in the deepest such attack in Israel. Israel has deployed Patriot interceptor missiles in the northern port city of Haifa which was hit by rockets earlier. In an emotional appeal on Lebanese television, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora called for an immediate ceasefire and urged the US to intervene. "Lebanon is a disaster zone... and (it) pleads to its friends in the world to rush to its aid," he said. Following emergency talks in Egypt, Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa said the Middle East peace process had failed and urged the UN Security Council to tackle the crisis.

Labour peer tells Blair to step down as Prime Minister
Lord Hattersley says Gordon Brown should be the next Labour leader He said any tenure in Downing Street beyond this year's Labour conference would damage the party. Last week left-wing backbencher John McDonnell, Hayes and Harlington MP, said he would run for the Labour leadership when Tony Blair stands down. But Lord Hattersley said Chancellor Gordon Brown was the "ideal" candidate to take over the reins of the party. 'High note' "The prime minister ought not to announce he's going at party conference - he ought to go at party conference," the Labour peer told GMTV's Sunday Programme. Mr Blair said he did not want constant speculation over the timing of his resignation. "I'm not sitting there, you know, obsessing the entire time about when the precise date is and all the rest of it. Get on with the job, that's what the public want and we are," he told BBC One's Politics Show. I think what the Labour Party needs to win the next election is a solemn, serious, if you like, son of the manse Lord Hattersley Blair defiant over departure date Mr Hattersley said Mr Blair should point to Labour's achievements since coming to power in 1997, pass the leadership baton to his successor and "thank the party for what they've done". "The longer he stays on the more damaging it is for him as well as the party in my view." He also said that if Mr Blair stayed until 2007, it would be "impossible to put new life" into the party.

Despite 6 warnings Israel bombed and killed 4 UN observers
 » Special Report | Video archive | E-mail us: Your stories | How to help civilians  U.N.: Observers made many calls before strike Annan, China condemn attack that killed 4 YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Israel Lebanon Hezbollah or or Create Your Own BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- The U.N. observers killed when an Israeli bomb hit their bunker in Lebanon Tuesday called an Israeli military liaison about 10 times in the six hours before they died to warn that aerial attacks were getting close to their position, a U.N. officer said. After each call, the Israeli officer promised to have the bombing stopped, an officer at the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) base in Noqoura said. Finally, an Israeli bomb exploded directly on the U.N. post near Khiyam, killing four U.N. observers from Austria, Finland, Canada and China, the U.N. officer said. As of Wednesday morning, three of the four bodies had been recovered from the rubble, an officer at the UNIFIL base in Noqoura said. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said the incident would be "thoroughly investigated" and that the Israeli military had taken measures since the start of its bombardment of southern Lebanon to protect the U.N. observers there. "Israel would never deliberately target U.N. personnel," Mark Regev said. According to Regev, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called U.N.Secretary-General Kofi Annan and "expressed his regret at this tragedy in Lebanon." Annan issued a sharply worded statement Tuesday evening which said he was "shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting ... of a U.N. observer post in southern Lebanon." He called on Israel to conduct "a full investigation into this very disturbing incident." "This coordinated artillery and aerial attack on a long established and clearly marked U.N. post at Khiyam occurred despite personal assurances given to me by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that U.N. positions would be spared Israeli fire," Annan said. The timeline provided CNN by a U.N. officer in Lebanon showed the first bomb exploded about 200 yards from the U.N. outpost at 1:20 p.m. Tuesday, prompting the first call by the UNIFIL observers to their designated contact with the Israeli military. A series of about nine more bombs hit within 100 to 400 yards from the observers over the next several hours, with a call to the Israeli military following each explosion. The U.N. base at Noqoura lost contact with the outpost at 7:40 p.m., apparently the time of the direct hit, the officer said.

Lebanon's prime minister denounced "Israeli war criminals" and cancelled talks with the US secretary of state. Israel said it regretted the incident - but added that civilians had been warned to flee the village. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Israel would "continue to act with no hesitation against Hezbollah" which has been firing rockets into Israel from southern Lebanon. What has happened in Qana shows this is a situation that simply cannot continue British Prime Minister Tony Blair Lebanon crisis 'cannot continue' Hundreds of Lebanese protesters staged a violent demonstration, ransacking the UN headquarters in Beirut, chanting slogans against the US and Israel and in support of the Hezbollah militants. Several countries have condemned the attack and renewed their calls for an immediate ceasefire - opposed by Israel and the US. At an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council, Mr Annan urged members to strongly condemn the Qana attack and to put aside differences to call for an immediate ceasefire.

Several Katyusha rockets hit the border town of Kiryat Shemona on Sunday, wounding several people, in what residents described as the worst day so far. A total of 51 Israelis, including at least 18 civilians, have been killed in the conflict, sparked by Hezbollah's capture of two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid on 12 July.

Colombia's Uribe sworn in to second term as president
BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 7 -- President Alvaro Uribe began a second term Monday, promising to seek an elusive peace with leftist rebels while maintaining the hard-line security policies credited with a sharp drop in murder and kidnappings. In an inauguration ceremony attended by 11 heads of state, Uribe said he would devote "all of his energies" to pursuing a peaceful end to this nation's four-decade-old civil war. "I'm not afraid of negotiating peace," Uribe, 54, said after taking the oath of office. "I confess what worries me more is falling short of that goal and instead seeing our gains in security eroded." After reforming the constitution last year to allow himself to seek a second term, Uribe coasted to victory in the May 28 elections with 62 percent of the vote -- 10 percentage points more than he won in 2002. Despite his reputation as a free-market conservative and Washington's closest ally in Latin America, Uribe at times in his speech sounded like the left-leaning social democrats favored of late by voters in neighboring countries. "We are against a fiscally tight macro-economic policy that leaves economic growth to the luck of supply and demand. Uribe made no bold proposals for improving the lot of the 50 percent of Colombians who live below the poverty line -- on less than three U.S. dollars a day -- even as the rich benefit from the increased foreign investment that improved security has brought. Uribe has taken a hard line against terrorism and drug trafficking Before presidents and officials from more than 20 countries, he pledged to seek peace with left-wing rebels and improve the country's economy.

Police in Britain uncover suspected terrorist plot
All airports have been put under the restrictions Reid statement It is thought the plan was to detonate explosive devices smuggled in hand luggage on to as many as 10 aircraft. Police are searching premises after 21 people were arrested. Home Secretary John Reid said they believed the "main players" were accounted for. High security is causing delays at all UK airports. The threat level to the UK has been raised by MI5 to critical after the arrests in London, High Wycombe and Birmingham. Critical threat level - the highest - means "an attack is expected imminently and indicates an extremely high level of threat to the UK". Three US airlines are believed to have been targeted. Mr Reid said had the attack gone ahead it would have caused a loss of life of "unprecedented scale". He said they were "confident" the main players were in custody, but neither the police nor government are "in any way complacent".

"There has been an enormous amount of co-operation with the US authorities which has been of great value and underlines the threat we face and our determination to counter it," he said in a statement. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the plot was thought to have involved a series of "waves" of simultaneous attacks, targeting three planes each time.

North Korea reportedly planning nuclear bomb test
S. Korea: No evidence of North nuke test SEOUL (AP)  South Korea said Friday it has no clear evidence that communist North Korea is preparing for a nuclear test, responding to a news report citing a U.S. official saying intelligence showed possible signs of an upcoming test. "I haven't heard that we have confirmed clear evidence that North Korea is pursuing a nuclear test," Unification Minister Lee Jong-seok told lawmakers at a committee hearing. Lee said there is frequent speculation about the North's nuclear program, but that not all of it turns out to be true. "We are closely monitoring North Korea's activities related to the nuclear program and missiles," he said. Lee Yong-joon, head of the South Korean Foreign Ministry's task force on the North Korea nuclear issue, said South Korea was monitoring movements in North Korea in close cooperation with the United States. The United States and South Korea "share all intelligence and evaluations" related to North Korean movements, Lee told The Associated Press. "We cannot specifically confirm the report as it is an intelligence matter," a spokesman said on condition of anonymity, citing policy. The comments came after ABC News quoted an unidentified State Department official as saying a North Korean nuclear test was "a real possibility." The report also cited an unidentified senior U.S. military official as saying that a U.S. intelligence agency recently had seen "suspicious vehicle movement" at a suspected test site, including the unloading of reels of cable outside an underground facility in northeast North Korea. The report said the White House was told about the intelligence last week. The White House declined to confirm the report, but an official there who refused to be identified said Washington's position was that a "North Korean nuclear test would be an extremely provocative action that would draw universal condemnation from the international community."

Multiple bombs set off in Turkish resort
The cause of the blast is being investigated by police The explosion happened close to shops and restaurants in the heart of the popular Mediterranean city of Antalya. The blast came hours after three bombs hit another coastal resort, Marmaris, injuring at least 21 people. Meanwhile, Turkish police arrested a man they said was plotting a further bomb attack in the city of Izmir. The Turkish state news agency said the man was from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) separatist group. It said other people were also detained for helping the suspect and that plastic explosives were seized in the operation. Nervous atmosphere The cause of Monday's blast in Antalya is not yet known, but the authorities were said to be looking for two suspects. Meanwhile, a Kurdish militant group with links to the banned PKK has claimed responsibility for Sunday's blasts in Marmaris and Istanbul. "We had warned before, Turkey is not a safe country. Tourists should not come to Turkey," the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (Tak) said on its website. The Turkish economy is heavily reliant on tourism, which Kurdish separatists have repeatedly threatened to target.

Case against Karr dropped: no DNA link to JonBenet Ramsey murder
Mr Karr had told reporters JonBenet's death was an accident The case against John Mark Karr was dropped after forensic tests found that his DNA did not match that discovered at the scene of the crime. Mr Karr, 41, was arrested in Thailand two weeks ago and had been due to appear in court on Monday. He has said he was there when the girl died, but her death was an accident. But outside court in Colorado on Monday public defender Seth Temin said in a statement: "The warrant on Mr Karr has been dropped by the district attorney. They're not proceeding with this case. "We're deeply distressed by the fact that they took this man and dragged him here from Bangkok, Thailand with no forensic evidence confirming the allegations against him, and no independent factors leading to a presumption that he did anything wrong." However, Mr Karr is still in police custody, following a request that he be taken to California to face child pornography charges dating back to 2001. 'No forensic evidence' Mr Karr's arrest sparked hopes in the United States that one of the most infamous crimes of recent years might finally be solved. The BBC's John Kay in California says there has been hysterical media coverage of developments since he was arrested in Bangkok. But Mr Karr's ex-wife Lara has insisted he was with her in Alabama for the entire Christmas period of 1996, when JonBenet died.

27 die from pipeline explosion in Diwaniya, Iraq
The oil pipeline explosion caused a huge fire A police spokesman said people had been siphoning fuel from the pipeline in an industrial zone south of Diwaniya, 130km (80 miles) south of Baghdad. Casualty reports varied widely - one put the death toll at 74. In a separate development, police found more than 20 bodies at two sites in Baghdad. Officials say the cause of the blast in Diwaniya is still being investigated. Witnesses told Reuters the explosion happened at about 2300 local time (1900 GMT) on Monday, when a large group of people were taking fuel from two pools. A unnamed police source quoted by Reuters news agency said 50 people had been killed, while AFP quoted a health official saying 74 died. "Some of the wounded have burns on 75% of their bodies," Hamid Jaafi, a health official in Diwaniya told Reuters. Government officials said the pipeline, which used to carry petrol to the capital, had been out of operation since 2003. But a defence ministry official said it still held residues of fuel and residents often cut holes in it to siphon off petrol, which is in short supply despite Iraq's wealth of oil deposits.

Second in command of al-Qaeda in Iraq in custody
Zarqawi Lieutenant Arrested in Iraq An Iraqi government official says al-Qaida in Iraq's second in command has been captured. Iraq's National Security Adviser Mufaq al-Rubaie told reporters Sunday that Hamed Farid al-Saeedi was arrested a few days ago. Al-Saeedi is reportedly the mastermind behind the February bombing of a Shia shrine in Samarra. That attack is one of the seminal moments of modern Iraq. Images of the shattered gold dome of the shrine sparked the wave of sectarian violence that has Iraq on the verge of a full-scale civil war. "Under the orders of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi," he said, "al-Saeedi planned the bombing to ignite a civil war between Sunnis and Shi'ites." In addition to the bombing, al-Saeedi is believed to have planned and carried out countless kidnappings, bombings and assassinations. Working on intelligence gained after the death of Zarqawi, Hamed al-Saeedi was tracked down to a house in Tikrit, where he was reportedly found hiding behind women and children. Rubaie also said this successful raid shows the capability and professionalism of Iraq's security forces and intelligence operations. U.S. military sources confirmed to NPR the capture of al-Saeedi and his status as the deputy commander of al-Qaida in Iraq. Saedi is accused of ordering the Samarra shrine's destruction Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffaq al-Rubaie, told a news conference the man, Hamad Jama al-Saedi, was detained a few days ago. Mr Rubaie said the man was behind the bombing of a Shia shrine in Samarra in February that drew revenge attacks.

British PM Tony Blair pressured by resignations
Mr Blair is being urged to make a public announcement He branded ex-junior minister Tom Watson, the most senior person to quit, "disloyal, discourteous and wrong" for signing a letter urging him to go. The resignations came as Mr Blair faces growing pressure to name a departure date or even quit now. Gordon Brown's backers say assurances he will resign in May are "not enough". 'Brownite plot' But Mr Blair's supporters claim the calls for him to quit are an orchestrated plot by supporters of Mr Brown, who has so far declined to comment on the furore. In a statement, former Home Secretary David Blunkett said: "It is now in Gordon Brown's - and the Labour Party's - best interests for those seeking the prime minister's immediate departure to back off. "This is not only to avoid our opponents exploiting the impression of disintegration and division, but also to avoid the split of our party, which would have lasting consequences. "No-one can benefit from a split in the government or the party now, or in the foreseeable future, and this is patently avoidable by a return to common sense." 'Clear timetable' Mr Watson and the six parliamentary private secretaries (PPSs) - who are unpaid ministerial aides at the bottom rung of the government ladder - were among a number of normally loyal Labour MPs from the 2001 intake who signed a letter calling on Mr Blair to quit. Without an urgent change in the leadership of the party it becomes less likely that we will win that election Loyal Labour MPs urge Blair to quit In full: 2001 intake letter The six were: Khalid Mahmood, Wayne David, Ian Lucas, Mark Tami, Chris Mole and David Wright. In a joint statement, four of the PPS group said Mr Blair had "not ended the uncertainty over when you intend to leave office, which is damaging the government and the party". Mr David told BBC Radio 5 Live he was worried about next year's elections in Scotland and Wales, adding: "We obviously will do much better if we have a clear timetable set out for transition".

Pope apologises in person for the reaction to his comments
The Pope said he wanted to clarify the true meaning of his address He said the medieval text which he quoted did not express in any way his personal opinion, adding the speech was an invitation to respectful dialogue. Some Muslim leaders said his statement was sufficient to defuse the row, but others said it did not go far enough. The 14th Century Christian emperor's quote said the Prophet Muhammad brought the world only evil and inhuman things. The Pope has been under intense scrutiny amid angry reactions from throughout the Muslim world.

But State Minister Mehmet Aydin said the pontiff appeared to be saying he was sorry for the outrage but not necessarily the remarks themselves. "You either have to say this 'I'm sorry' in a proper way or not say it at all - are you sorry for saying such a thing or because of its consequences?"

French newspaper suggests Osama bin Laden may be dead
AP General Michael Hayden, Director of the CIA, walked into the celebration of Saudi Arabia's national day in Washington D.C. and was immediately posed with the question of the day. "Is it true?" "Nope," Hayden said, immediately adding to the accumulating statements on the paucity of evidence that Osama bin Laden was dead. About an hour before, the Saudi government itself declared that it "has no evidence to support recent media reports that Osama bin Laden is dead. Information that has been reported otherwise is purely speculative and cannot be independently verified." Pakistani intelligence sources, who monitor the mountainous regions where Bin Laden is believed to be hiding out, had also dismissed the reports of the terror leader's death. A well placed source in Washington said the idea of Bin Laden's demise appears to have originated as a "hypothesis of some Saudi intelligence analysts with no hard evidence to back it up. No one at a high level is satisfied it's true." At his country's national day celebration in Washington, Saudi Ambassador Prince Turki al-Faisal said, "My understanding is that [Bin Laden] is alive and well and kicking. Earlier on Saturday, the French newspaper L'Est Republicain cited a report by the French intelligence service, Direction Generale des Services Exteriors (DGSE), saying that Saudi intelligence officials "seem to have become convinced that Osama bin Laden is dead." Echoing that report, a Saudi source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told TIME that Saudi officials have received multiple reports over the last several weeks that Bin Laden has been suffering from a water-borne illness.

IRA disbands military structure
The report said some IRA members remain involved in crime Monitors' statement He was speaking after the Independent Monitoring Commission said the IRA had changed radically and some of its most important structures were dismantled. The prime minister said politicians now had a "unique opportunity" to reach a "final settlement". Out of the IMC's 12 reports so far, it is its most positive report about IRA activities to date. READ THE REPORT Independent Monitoring Commission 12th report [912KB] Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here The report indicates that a number of key parts of the IRA's structure have been dismantled or substantially reduced. Mr Blair said there was "now a consensus across all main players in the politics of Northern Ireland, that change can only come through persuasion and not through violence of any sort". "The IRA has done what we asked it to do, and while issues like policing remain to be solved, the door is now open to a final settlement, which is why the talks next week in Scotland are going to be so important." "That doesn't mean that criminal activity by all members has stopped but the leadership has made public statements and internal directions, investigated incidents of breach of the policy, even expelled some members and has emphasised the importance of ensuring that business affairs are conducted in a legitimate way," he said. The report said there was not enough evidence or intelligence information for it to say who killed Denis Donaldson, the self-confessed British spy and former head of Sinn Fein's office at Stormont, who was shot dead in County Donegal in April. DUP leader Ian Paisley said he was encouraged that his party's pressure was working and if Sinn Fein signed up to policing there could be a deal. "If the police question is settled absolutely on a democratic basis and principle we would have come a long way along the road," he said. Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said: "The DUP don't have anything other than very limited options.

US court indicts man for treason
Adam Gadahn, the first American charged with treason in more than 50 years. (Associated Press) An American citizen was charged with treason Wednesday for the first time since just after the Second World War. Justice Department in Washington announced the charges against 28-year-old Adam Gadahn, who is alleged to have appeared in several videos made in support of al-Qaeda. Gadahn is from California but officials say he is neither in the United States nor in U.S. custody. The FBI says Gadahn was originally known as Adam Pearlman but changed his name when he converted to Islam at the age of 17. His nom de guerre is said to be Azzam the American. In a video posted on a militant Islamic website last month, Gadahn is said to have called for U.S. President George W. Bush to repent his actions and toaccept the Muslim faith. A video released in July allegedly features Gadahn praising those who kill Western troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The FBI says it has been seeking to question Gadahn for nearly two years. Story Highlights • NEW: Gadahn placed on most-wanted list; $1 million reward offered • Californian first American charged with treason since World War II era • Gadahn, 28, appealed to Americans in al Qaeda videos • Nicknamed "Azzam the American," he hailed 9/11 hijackers in video Adjust font size: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An American al Qaeda propagandist was indicted Wednesday on treason charges, the first person charged with the offense during the United States' war on terrorism, officials said. Adam Yahiye Gadahn, who has appeared in five al Qaeda videos, is also charged with offering material support for terrorism, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty said. He has been put on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list, and the State Department is offering a $1 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction.

Gag order imposed on Guantanamo whistleblower
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A paralegal and a military lawyer who brought forward allegations about prisoner abuse at the Guantanamo Bay detention center have been ordered not to speak with the press, lawyers and a military spokeswoman said Saturday. Marine Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, who represents a detainee at the U.S. naval base in eastern Cuba, filed a complaint with the Pentagon last week alleging that abuse was ongoing at the prison. He attached a sworn statement from his paralegal, Sgt. Heather Cerveny, in which she said several Guantanamo guards bragged in a bar about beating detainees, describing it as common practice. Muneer Ahmad, a civilian defense lawyer for Omar Khadr, a Canadian detainee whose military counsel is Vokey, said that Vokey and Cerveny were ordered Friday by the U.S. Marines not to speak with the press. A spokeswoman for the Marines confirmed the order, saying Vokey's supervisor _ Col. Carol Joyce, the Marines' chief defense counsel _ had directed him not to communicate with the media "pending her review of the facts." "This is necessary to ensure all actions of counsel are in compliance with regulations establishing professional standards for military attorneys," the spokeswoman, 1st Lt. Blanca E. Binstock, said in a statement. Reached by telephone, Vokey declined to comment, saying, "I can't even talk about it." Ahmad said Vokey was also barred from talking to the media about anything related to the military commissions _ tribunals set up to try detainees. He said he didn't know how the order was issued and that Vokey previously had the military's authorization to speak with the media. "I think he is very concerned about his ability to perform his job as a lawyer," Ahmad said. Cerveny, 23, visited Guantanamo last month and has said she spent an hour with the guards at the military club.

2006 U.S. Congressional Elections
Some glitches reported as voters turn out for midterm elections WASHINGTON  Millions of voters, including President Bush, began voting today for critical midterm elections, but voting machine glitches in at least three states caused some jangled nerves and early delays. At stake are all 435 House seats, 33 Senate seats and governorships in 36 states in an election that will set the tone and agenda for the final two years of Bush's second term. As polls opened across the country, electronic voting machine problems frazzled voters and election workers in dozens of precincts. Voting was delayed in Indiana and Ohio, while in Florida some election officials had little choice but to turn to paper ballots instead. In Cleveland, voters rolled their eyes as poll workers fumbled with new voting machines that they couldn't get to start properly. "We got five machines — one of them's got to work," said Willette Scullank, a trouble shooter from the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, elections board. Election officials in Delaware County, Ind., planned to seek a court order to extend voting after an apparent computer error prevented voters from casting ballots in 75 precincts. "We are working with precincts one-by-one over the telephone to get the problem fixed," Wenger said. With voting underway, the key question is whether Democrats can take advantage of national dissatisfaction with Bush and the war in Iraq to win the 15 seats they need to control the House of Representatives and six seats they need to take the Senate.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld resigns
President Bush emerged from an election in which his party took what he described as a "thumping" and ousted Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld yesterday, saying that a "fresh perspective" is needed to guide the military through the difficult war in Iraq. Speaking at a White House news conference the day after Democrats took control of the House of Representatives, and possibly the Senate, an apparently chastened and conciliatory Bush said he was nominating former CIA director Robert M. Gates to replace the long-embattled Rumsfeld. After six years of a presidency that has been about drawing lines against the Democrats and taunting them as weak, Bush presented a sharp about-face in an appearance in the White House East Room. "What's changed today is the election is over," he said, "and the Democrats won." Acknowledging that the elections amounted to a rebuke of Republican leadership, Bush said voters had signaled they wanted cooperation and problem-solving in Washington. If anything, he seemed to greet defeat with an air of relief, as though the results had allowed him to abandon an all-is-well pretense that was increasingly at odds with his actual political circumstances. He said that he had begun to contemplate Rumsfeld's exit before the election -- even while he was publicly vowing that he would keep the defense secretary through the end of his term and insisting that polls forecasting Republican defeat were wrong. The defense secretary's removal was part of a broader White House effort to restructure Bush's presidency in the wake of the Democratic victory. Beyond the switch at the Pentagon, White House aides in recent weeks developed an agenda designed to attract bipartisan support, including an increase in the minimum wage -- a longtime Democratic priority -- as well as comprehensive immigration legislation, energy measures, and the extension of the No Child Left Behind education program. "The American people want their leaders in Washington to set aside partisan differences, conduct ourselves in an ethical manner, and work together to address the challenges facing our nation."

Rumsfeld memo recognizes need for 'major adjustment' in Iraq
“Recast the U.S. military mission and the U.S. goals (how we talk about them) — go minimalist,” he added. The memo suggests frustration with the pace of turning over responsibility to the Iraqi authorities; in fact, the memo calls for examination of ideas that roughly parallel troop withdrawal proposals presented by some of the White House’s sharpest Democratic critics. (Text of the Memo) Advertisement Continue reading the main story The memo’s discussion of possible troop reduction options offers a counterpoint to Mr. Rumsfeld’s frequent public suggestions that discussions about force levels are driven by requests from American military commanders. It also puts on the table several ideas for troop redeployments or withdrawals, even as there have been recent pronouncements from American commanders emphasizing the need to maintain troop levels for the time being. The memorandum sometimes has a finger-wagging tone, as Mr. Rumsfeld says that the Iraqis must “pull up their socks,” and suggests that reconstruction aid should be withheld in violent areas to avoid rewarding “bad behavior.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Other options called for shrinking the number of bases, establishing benchmarks that would mark the Iraqis’ progress toward political, economic and security goals and conducting a “reverse embeds” program to attach Iraqi soldiers to American squads. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The memo was finished one day after President Bush interviewed Robert M. Gates, the president of Texas A&M University, as a potential successor to Mr. Rumsfeld and one day before the midterm elections. By then it was clear that the Republicans appeared likely to suffer a setback at the polls and that the administration was poised to begin reconsidering its Iraq strategy. It is unclear whether he knew at that point that he was about to be replaced, though the White House has said that Mr. Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld had a number of conversations on the matter. Told that The New York Times had obtained a copy of it, a Pentagon spokesman, Eric Ruff, confirmed its authenticity. “As it became clear that people were considering options for the way forward, the secretary had some views on the subject, and this memo reflects those views,” he said. At the Pentagon, Mr. Rumsfeld has been famous for his “snowflakes” — memos that drift down to the bureaucracy from on high and that are used to ask questions, stimulate debate and shape policy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Unlike the lawyerly memo on Iraq policy submitted Nov. 8 by Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, Mr. Rumsfeld’s listed more than a dozen “illustrative options” that the defense secretary did not endorse, but suggested merited serious consideration. “Many of these options could, and in a number of cases, should be done in combination with others,” Mr. Rumsfeld advised.

Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk receives Nobel Prize
By Sarah Rainsford BBC News, Istanbul  Pamuk is one of the youngest writers to have won the prize "Our Pride," is the headline in Radikal. "It's very important, I congratulate him," says bookseller Mehmet, who moved all his Pamuk stock to the front of the store as soon as he heard that the first ever Turk had won the Nobel Prize for Literature. "It's not only Orhan Pamuk who's won here. This prize will be a chance for all the world to get to know Turkish literature." Each of his books had sold more than 115,000 copies here at home. He has been translated into dozens of foreign languages - and demand is now soaring. In the first four hours after the news from Sweden, Pamuk's publishers in Istanbul received another 6,000 orders. They have had to allocate extra printing presses to keep up. 'Western plot' Earlier this year nationalist groups labelled the author a traitor when he spoke out on two of Turkey's most sensitive issues - claims that Ottoman Turks committed genocide against the Armenians nine decades ago, and the plight of ethnic Kurds in modern-day Turkey.

U.S. Senator Tim Johnson hospitalized
Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson of South Dakota was hospitalized Wednesday, weeks before his party was to take control of the Senate by a one-vote margin. But by evening, his condition was unclear, with conflicting reports over whether he had suffered a stroke. The one thing that appeared to be true was that Johnson had some undiagnosed illness that has left him with difficulty speaking and moving. Johnson, who turns 60 on Dec. 28, was admitted to George Washington University Hospital, said Julianne Fisher, Johnson's communications director. The illness was initially thought to be a stroke. Fisher later said, however, that Johnson did not suffer a stroke or heart attack. In a statement late Wednesday, Fisher said, "Senator Johnson continues to undergo testing and procedures at George Washington University Hospital. We expect to have more information in the morning." Admiral John Eisold, attending physician of the U.S. Capitol, issued a statement saying Johnson was admitted to the hospital "with the symptoms of a stroke." Johnson became disoriented during a conference call with reporters at midday Wednesday, stuttering in response to a question.

Saddam Hussein executed by hanging
When Sgt Ellis left, Saddam Hussein said he would be his brother In an interview with a US newspaper, Master Sgt Robert Ellis provided a rare glimpse into the last years of Saddam Hussein, who was executed on Saturday. Sgt Ellis looked after the former Iraqi leader - whom they called 'Victor' - in 2004 and 2005 at a camp near Baghdad. The prisoner rarely complained during his time in captivity, he said. He added that he was under strict orders to do whatever necessary to keep Saddam alive. "Saddam Hussein cannot die in US custody," he said a US colonel had told him. 'Coping skills' Sgt Ellis, from St Louis, told the St Louis Post-Dispatch that Saddam Hussein was held in a six foot by eight foot (1.8m to 2.4m) cell with a cot, table, two plastic chairs and two wash basins. In fact, I was there to help him, and he respected that Robert Ellis When he was allowed to go outside, Saddam Hussein saved bread scraps from his meals to feed to the birds, Sgt Ellis said. "He said he was a farmer when he was young and he never forgot where he came from," Sgt Ellis said. "He had very good coping skills," Sgt Ellis said. Saddam talked about when he used to read bedtime stories to his young children and recalled giving his daughter medicine for an upset stomach.

Bush plans to roll out new Iraq strategy this week
By Justin Webb BBC News, Washington  Mr Bush has come under pressure to change his strategy on Iraq The speech will reveal a plan to send more US troops to Iraq to focus on ways of bringing greater security, rather than training Iraqi forces. The move comes with figures from Iraqi ministries suggesting that deaths among civilians are at record highs. The US president arrived back in Washington on Monday after a week-long holiday at his ranch in Texas. The BBC was told by a senior administration source that the speech setting out changes in Mr Bush's Iraq policy is likely to come in the middle of next week. The speech, the BBC has been told, involves increasing troop numbers. The exact mission of the extra troops in Iraq is still under discussion, according to officials, but it is likely to focus on providing security rather than training Iraqi forces. The need to find some way of pacifying Iraq has been underlined by statistics revealed by various ministries in the Iraqi government, suggesting that well over 1,000 civilians a month are dying. As they prepare to take control of Congress this week and face up to campaign pledges to restore bipartisanship and openness, Democrats are planning to largely sideline Republicans from the first burst of lawmaking. But instead of allowing Republicans to fully participate in deliberations, as promised after the Democratic victory in the Nov. 7 midterm elections, Democrats now say they will use House rules to prevent the opposition from offering alternative measures, assuring speedy passage of the bills and allowing their party to trumpet early victories. Nancy Pelosi, the Californian who will become House speaker, and Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, who will become majority leader, finalized the strategy over the holiday recess in a flurry of conference calls and meetings with other party leaders.

US raids Iran 'liaison office', Russia says it is unacceptable
TEHRAN, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. forces raided the Iranian consulate in Iraq's northern city of Arbil and arrested five of its staff members, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported on Thursday. After disarming the consulate's guards and breaking into the gate, U.S. troops ent ered the office building early Thursday morning, IRNA said, confirming Iraqi state television's earlier reports. The Iraqi state television reported earlier that Multi-National Forces in Arbil detained staff members of the Iranian consulate there and confiscated computers and some documents. The U.S. troops arrested five staff members and confiscated computers and documents, IRNA quoted "reliable sources" as saying. The Iranian Embassy in Baghdad sent a letter to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry Thursday morning to protest against "the U.S. illegal move" and call on the Iraqi government to help secure immediate release of the five people, IRNA said. According to Iran's state television, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said that U.S. forces in Iraq "bear full responsibility for the fate of the abducted diplomats." Top envoys of the Iraqi Embassy as well as the Swiss Embassy, which takes care of the U.S. interests in Iran, were summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry for explanations, the television said. Quoting its reporter in Arbil, the television said that forces under the control of Iraq's Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani had tried to prevent U.S. troops from taking away the diplomats, deeming the U.S. move as an affront to the authority of the self-rule regional government. Arbil is in the Kurdish-controlled north of Iraq, 350 km north of Baghdad. Under an agreement between Baghdad and Tehran, Iran set up its consulate in the city in 2006 to facilitate cross-border visits of their citizens. TV: Coalition forces detain Iranian diplomatic personnel in N Iraq BAGHDAD, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Multi-National Forces in Arbil province detained staff of the Iranian consulate there, Iraq's state-run television reported on Thursday.

Israeli head of military Dan Halutz resigns
By Jo Floto BBC News, Jerusalem  The resignation may not draw a line under discussion of recent military failures Last August, just 10 days after the conflict had ended, Lt Gen Dan Halutz was already admitting that mistakes had been made. There had been failures in combat, he said, "notably in the areas of logistics, operations and command". There had been successes too, he added, but many in Israel were left wondering what had actually gone right. After more than a month of fighting, Hezbollah was still able to fire rockets into the north of the country, and the two soldiers whose capture had sparked the conflict were still in captivity. Gen Halutz, a former Air force chief, was accused of relying too heavily on aerial bombardment, and of botching the ground offensive. Poor preparations Soldiers, and particularly reservists, had complained of poor leadership, lack of equipment, poor training and a shortage of supplies. Some told of spending days without food, forced to drink water from the canteens of dead Lebanese guerrillas. In order to guide and lead we must live up to our responsibilities Dan Halutz's resignation letter Critics wondered why the army appeared not to have been prepared for a war on the northern border. He even shrugged off a revelation that he had sold his share portfolio in July, the day senior politicians and commanders were deciding whether to go to war. No 'running away' Earlier this month he told a news conference that would he stay on ''to correct what can be corrected',' dismissing calls for his resignation saying it would be "running away".

Sinn Fein votes to accept policing
About 900 party members voted on the motion at a special party conference (ard fheis) in Dublin which was attended by more than 2,000 people. Sinn Fein support for policing and DUP commitment to power-sharing are seen as essential to restoring NI devolution. A six hour debate was cut short as the leadership forced a vote which was carried with 90% support. The decision gives Sinn Fein's ruling executive the authority to declare its support for the PSNI and the criminal justice system when devolution is restored and policing and justice powers are transferred to the Northern Ireland Assembly. You have created the potential to change the political landscape on this island forever Gerry Adams Reaction to the Sinn Fein vote Q&A: The vote Speaking after the vote, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said the decision was truly historic. "Today you have created the potential to change the political landscape on this island forever," he said. "You have created the opportunity to significantly advance our struggle and you have seized the opportunity to further our primary objective of united Ireland through the building of greater political strength." Mr Adams also said that republicanism and unionism had reached an historic compromise. "If the promise and hope of the peace process is to deliver peace and prosperity, that means beginning a real dialogue, an anti-sectarian dialogue, a dialogue which will move us to a real future," he added. A spokesman for Tony Blair said the prime minister welcomed the "historic decision and recognised the leadership it has taken to get to this point". He said: "It is vital that we continue to maintain the momentum from the St Andrews agreement and the timetable set out in that agreement." Sir Hugh Orde said he welcomed the Sinn Fein vote Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain described the vote as a breakthrough. "What had always been a massive impediment to stable and lasting government (in Northern Ireland) has been removed," he said.

Recovery plan for New Orleans to be ratified
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 11 -- Angry homeowners screamed and City Council members seethed Wednesday as this city's recovery commission recommended imposing a four-month building moratorium on most of New Orleans and creating a powerful new authority that could use eminent domain to seize homes in neighborhoods that will not be rebuilt. Hundreds of residents packed into a hotel ballroom interrupted the presentation of the long-awaited proposal with shouts and taunts, booed its main architect and unrolled a litany of complaints. One by one, homeowners stepped to a microphone to lampoon the plan -- which contemplates a much smaller city and relies on persuading the federal government to spend billions on new housing and a light-rail system -- as "audacious," "an academic exercise," "garbage," "a no-good, rotten scheme." "You missed the boat," homeowner Fred Yoder, who lived in heavily flooded Lakeview, told committee members. "Give me a break: We don't need a light-rail system. The plan released Wednesday is the first stage of what is sure to be a multi-layered, multi-level effort to resuscitate New Orleans. Mayor C. Ray Nagin, who can accept or alter the proposal, will have to present the plan to a state commission that will control allocation of billions of federal dollars, as well as to Donald E. Powell, President Bush's hurricane recovery coordinator, and the White House. The commission's recommendations are heavily dependent on federal money, counting on $12 billion to buy storm-damaged homes and $4.8 billion for infrastructure improvements, including an ambitious light-rail proposal to connect downtown New Orleans with the city's airport, Baton Rouge and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The furious reaction to the plan is the latest agonizing episode in this city's troubled campaign to reinvigorate itself after the devastating floods caused by Hurricane Katrina last August. Nagin, already politically weakened by widespread criticism of his response to the flooding, now faces the difficult challenge of guiding decisions about whether some parts of the city will cease to exist. Some activists have long accused the commission -- which was appointed by Nagin -- of trying to find ways to abandon predominantly black neighborhoods, such as the Lower Ninth Ward. Wednesday's unveiling did nothing to assuage their fears, even though commission members promised to give all neighborhoods an opportunity to prove that they should be rebuilt by convening planning groups in coming months. The proposed moratorium would be in the city's most damaged neighborhoods, and officials would use the four-month period to gauge whether enough residents will come back to make the areas viable. "If this plan goes forward as it is, many people's worst fears about our African American heritage and population will come true," said Sue Sperry of the New Orleans Preservation Resource Center.

US claims Iraqi militants armed with Iranian weapons
There should be no foreign troops in Iraq, the president said Interview clip Mr Ahmadinejad made the comments in a rare US television interview on Monday. He was speaking after US officials said they had evidence Iran was providing weapons to Shia militias in Iraq who were attacking the US military. Mr Ahmadinejad said Iran "shied away from all conflict" and that no peace would come with foreign troops in Iraq. 'Baseless propaganda' In the interview with ABC Television in Tehran, Mr Ahmadinejad was asked if he feared a US military attack. Why should we be afraid?" Mr Ahmadinejad said he thought the possibility of such an attack was "very low". The US is following another policy, trying to hide its defeats and failures and that's why it is pointing its fingers to others Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Ahmadinejad excerpts "We think there are wise people in the US who would stop such illegal actions," he said. And he stressed that Iran's position was clear, saying, "Anyone who wants to attack our country will be severely punished." The Bush administration denies it is planning to invade Iran but has indicated it is willing to use military force to deal with any Iranian interference inside Iraq. He said the accusations were "excuses to prolong the stay" of US forces and that they would need a "court to prove the case". "The US is following another policy, trying to hide its defeats and failures and that's why it is pointing its fingers to others," Mr Ahmadinejad said.

Champions League round of sixteen—first leg results
Lille appeared to consider walking off in protest The French side were angry that Ryan Giggs' free-kick was allowed to stand to give United a 1-0 advantage. Uefa rejected their initial protest and a subsequent appeal so the French club considered taking their protest to the Court of Arbitration of Sport. But on Friday Lille, who also lost the second leg 1-0, announced they would not be taking their appeal any further. A statement on the club's official website said: "In order not to sink into relentless legal proceedings with no end in sight, (we) have taken the decision not to pursue its appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport." Lille were eliminated from the Champions League on Wednesday, with United completing a 2-0 aggregate victory. Uefa also charged Lille with the improper behaviour of their players, who appeared to contemplate leaving the pitch in protest at United's goal. On an incident-filled evening, United fans were involved in a crush scare in the Stade Felix-Bollaert and Uefa's control and disciplinary body will discuss the safety and security issues on 22 March. Barca poured men forward but the Reds took the lead when Bellamy teed up Riise to fire home and they held on to win despite seeing Deco hit the post. The pre-match headlines had been all about an alleged training camp fracas between Bellamy and Riise - but both were in Liverpool's starting line-up and instantly linked up as the Reds made a confident start to the game. Inside the first four minutes Steven Gerrard released Riise and his driven cross from the left was only just too strong for the Welshman.

Iranian TV station announces first space rocket launch
But officials later said it was for research and would not go into orbit. Experts say if Iran has fired a rocket into space it would cause alarm abroad as it would mean scientists had crossed important technological barriers. Iran has made little secret of its desire to become a space power and already has a satellite in orbit launched by the Russians. The latest launch - if confirmed - comes at a time of mounting tension between Tehran and the West over Iran's controversial nuclear programme. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany are due to meet on Monday to discuss the possibility of more sanctions over the nuclear issue. On Sunday, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivered another defiant speech insisting there is no going back on Iran's nuclear programme. Iran's potential nuclear military programme, combined with an advanced missile capability, would destabilise the region Sir Richard Dalton, former UK ambassador to Iran One of his deputy foreign ministers, Manouchehr Mohammadi, said they had prepared themselves for any situation arising from the issue, even for war. Meanwhile, foreign ministers from seven Muslim states meeting in Pakistan have called for a diplomatic solution to the "dangerous" stand-off. "It is vital that all issues must be resolved through diplomacy and there must be no resort to use of force," said a statement issued after talks involving ministers from Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Missile technology Iranian TV broke the news of the reported test saying: "The first space rocket has been successfully launched into space." Ahmadinejad has claimed Iran's right to nuclear technology It quoted the head of Iran's aerospace research centre, Mohsen Bahrami, as saying that "the rocket was carrying material intended for research created by the ministries of science and defence". However, Ali Akbar Golrou, executive director of the same facility, was later quoted by Fars news agency as saying the craft launched by was a sub-orbital rocket for scientific research. "What was announced by the head of the research centre was the news of launching this sounding rocket," Mr Golrou said. It would not remain in orbit but could rise to about 150km (94 miles) before a parachute-assisted descent to Earth.

Toxic chemical spills in the Ohio River
The lower Ohio River has reopened to barge traffic after being shut for more than 12 hours due to a tow boat hitting a lock and a barge leaking a petrochemical into the waterway, the U.S. Coast Guard said on Thursday. REUTERS/Graphic CHICAGO The lower Ohio River has reopened to barge traffic after being shut for more than 12 hours due to a tow boat hitting a lock and a barge leaking a petrochemical into the waterway, the U.S. Coast Guard said on Thursday. The stretch of the river near Brookport, Illinois, reopened around 10:30 p.m. CST Wednesday (0430 GMT Thursday), said Lt. Wayne Chapman at the Marine Safety Unit in Paducah, Kentucky. The closure was from mile marker 938 to 940. The barge was carrying 960,000 gallons of cumene or isopropylbenzene, a colorless liquid used in paint thinners, motor fuels and rubber. The closure did not greatly affect the flow of grain or petroleum on the waterway, traders said. About 10,300 gallons of cumene leaked into the river, but further contamination was not expected, Chapman said. Story Highlights • A barge hit an underwater dam, Coast Guard said • There's no threat to public drinking water, officials said • Cumene, a solvent used to produce other chemicals, was spilled • Experts determining the environmental impact of the spill Adjust font size: BROOKPORT, Illinois (CNN) -- As many as 8,000 gallons of a toxic solvent spilled into the Ohio River Wednesday after a barge hit an underwater dam, Coast Guard and Illinois state officials told CNN. Lt. Wayne Chapman of the U.S. Coast Guard said the barge, owned by Kirby Marine, hit the wicket dam, which is a type of movable dam, near Brookport and began leaking cumene, a solvent used to produce other chemicals. Maggie Carson of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield that experts are trying to determine the environmental impact of the spill. "There's a tremendous volume of water going through there, so there's a dilution factor, and this will be taken into consideration as they try to take measures to contain it," she said.

DUP and Sinn Féin make gains in Northern Ireland Assembly election
Brian Wilson said he was thrilled to be elected The party's NI chairperson Brian Wilson was elected in the North Down constituency on the 10th count after polling 2,839 first preference votes. Mr Wilson has been a councillor on North Down Borough Council since 1981, representing Alliance, then as an independent, before joining the Greens. He said he was thrilled "to have the opportunity of pushing forward Green Party policy in the assembly". "We are one of the youngest political parties in Northern Ireland but these elections have shown the level of support out there for our policies, and how quickly this support is growing. "It is tremendously rewarding that the Greens will now be a permanent fixture in the political landscape of Northern Ireland," he said. Irish Green Party leader Trevor Sargent, a member of the Irish parliament, said Mr Wilson's election was a breakthrough for the party in the whole of Ireland. "Brian's election, which resulted from extensive cross-community support, means that there is now Green representation at every level of political power on this island," Mr Sargent said. Mr Wilson, a member of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, joined the Green Party three years ago. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern speaking in Brussels Mr Hain said it was up to the parties to decide if they would sign up to power-sharing by the 26 March deadline. The talks come as the British and Irish prime ministers urged political leaders not to miss an opportunity of "historic proportions" to restore power-sharing.

Methane gas explosion at Ulyanovskaya Mine kills at least 108
Mines in Siberia's Kuzbass coal area have suffered from underfunding Attempts to rescue three Russian coal miners trapped underground are continuing, after an explosion killed 107 people at a Siberian pit on Monday. One more body was recovered late on Tuesday at the Ulyanovskaya mine, and officials said the search for the three still missing was proving difficult. Some 93 people were rescued from the mine, devastated by a methane blast. Rescuers described a scene of utter devastation, with collapsed and flooded mineshafts and bodies ripped apart. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Moscow says it is Russia's worst mining disaster for a generation. It occurred at 1030 (0730 GMT) on Monday, at a depth of about 270m (885 feet). However, the mine in question was only built a few years ago and had just had a new safety system installed. The mine is run by Yuzhkuzbassugol, an affiliate of Russian coal and steel firm Evraz Group SA. It lies in the Kuzbass coal area in Kemerovo region, nearly 3,000km (1,850 miles) east of Moscow.

Contaminated pet food causes massive recall
WASHINGTON – As many as one in six animals died in tests of suspect dog and cat food by the Canadian manufacturer after complaints were received that the products were poisoning pets around the United States, the U.S. government said today. A federal investigation is focusing on wheat gluten as the likely source of contamination that sparked a recall last Friday of 60 million cans and pouches of the suspect food, said Stephen F. Sundlof, the Food and Drug Administration's top veterinarian. The ingredient, a protein source, is commonly used as filler. Menu Foods told the FDA it received the first complaints of kidney failure and deaths among cats and dogs from pet owners on Feb. 20. During those tests, the company fed its product to 40 to 50 dogs and cats and some seven animals – the mix of species was not immediately known – died, Sundlof said. The contamination appeared more deadly to cats than to dogs, he said. The food was sold under both store and major brand labels at Wal-Mart, Kroger, Safeway and other large retailers. The FDA has yet to tally how many reports it has received of cats and dogs suffering kidney failure or death. "We are still trying to find out what the true picture is out there of animals. We're talking about 1 per cent of the pet food (supply) and it's really just impossible to extrapolate at this point," Sundlof said.

He said his Afghan driver had been decapitated in front of him by their Taleban guards. "I saw him being decapitated, it was horrific," he told Italian TG3 television. Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said the release had not been "simple" and that more details would be released later. Italian officials say the journalist will arrive in the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Tuesday and then fly home to Italy. Shortly afterwards, a tape was released in which the journalist said he had just two days to live.

15 Royal Navy sailors captured at gunpoint by Iranian guards
The men were seized at 1030 local time when they boarded a boat in the Gulf, off the coast of Iraq, which they suspected was smuggling cars. The Royal Navy said the group was on a routine patrol in Iraqi waters and were understood to be unharmed. But Iranian state television quoted the Iran foreign ministry as saying they had illegally entered Iranian waters. The Associated Press news agency is quoting US Navy official, Commander Kevin Aandahl, as saying that Iran's Revolutionary Guard were responsible. Mr Aandahl is also reported as saying the naval force had told them in a radio message that the British were not harmed. She added that she had called for a "full explanation" from Iran and had left them in no doubt that she wanted the group and their equipment back immediately. The task force's commander, Commodore Nick Lambert, said he was hoping there had been a "simple mistake" over territorial waters. Helicopters had reported seeing two British boats being moved along the Shatt al-Arab waterway to Iranian bases and there had been no evidence of fighting, he added. He said that despite scant communication, the 15 people were understood to be safe and had reacted in an "extremely professional way, in line with the rules of engagement".

Iran's insistence the group was in its waters last Friday saw the UK release GPS evidence to back up its denials. Tony Blair's official spokesman said the UK was not seeking a confrontation. Mr Larijani, head of Iran's supreme national security council, said: "It was announced that a woman in the group would be freed, but (this development) was met with an incorrect attitude." He later added on Iranian state radio the UK had "miscalculated" in its handling of the case. "They have created a ballyhoo over diplomatic ties and raised the issue with the UN," he said.

Adult-only TLD rejected by Internet body
The Icann board rejected the proposal nine votes to five The proposal for the .xxx domain was voted out by the overseer of the net's addressing system, seven years after the ideas was first put forward. Board members said they were concerned that approval would put the agency into the position of a content regulator. Backers of the .xxx domain said they were disappointed by the decision and would pursue the matter further. It is the third time that the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) has rejected the bid. Law-makers The idea of creating a net domain for pornography was first floated in 2001 and was given approval in June 2005 by Icann which oversees the net's addressing system. Final approval was scheduled to take place in December 2005 but this was delayed until May 2006 when the proposal was abruptly dropped over worries about how sites signing up to use .xxx would be policed. We are extremely disappointed by the board's action today Stuart Lawley, ICM Registry At the time, ICM Registry - the backer of the .xxx scheme - gave pledges that it would ensure sites signing up did not hit users with spam or spyware. ICM also had to give assurances that it would put in place systems to prevent children seeing the sites and that no .xxx sites would contain images of child abuse. A final decision on the domain name was taken at a meeting of board members in Lisbon, Portugal. "This decision was the result of very careful scrutiny and consideration of all the arguments," said Dr Vinton Cerf, chairman of Icann. "That consideration had led a majority of the board to believe that the proposal should be rejected." Many on the board voted against the proposals because they felt that accepting the domain would mean Icann would be seen as a regulator of content, deciding what is pornographic and what is not.

Ahmadinejad to free British navy personnel
"On the occasion of the birth anniversary of the great prophet of Islam, and on the occasion of Easter and Passover, I would like to announce that the great nation of Iran, while it is entitled to put the British military personnel on trial, has pardoned these 15 sailors and gives their release to the people of Britain as a gift. "I would like Mr Blair's government not to punish the sailors for acknowledging and telling the truth. They can go to the airport and they can go to their families. "I ask Mr Blair instead of occupying the other countries, I ask Mr Blair to think about the justice - to think about the truth and work for the British people not for himself." He said the British people should be told the truth about what the "British soldiers" were doing in Iranian waters. I'm sure the British people have every right to ask their government... what their soldiers were doing in Iraq or in Iranian water. Mr Ahmadinejad said the people of Iran were very upset at what he called the "invasion by the British sailors". "At this moment I wanted to say on behalf of the Iranian people - I wanted to thank the people who... arrested [them], I'm... admiring the commander who managed to capture these people who came to our water. I wanted to thank him for his braveness and I give him the third kind of medal." The BBC's Frances Harrison asked him what prompted his change of heart.

British navy personnel back home
Leading Seaman Chris Coe was shown on Iranian television The crew, freed by Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a "gift" to the British people on Wednesday, touched down at Heathrow Airport at 1200 BST. They were then flown to a Royal Marines base in Devon to see friends and relatives, and to be de-briefed. Tony Blair welcomed their return but accused elements of the Iranian regime of supporting terrorism in Iraq. 'Dual strategy' In a press conference given outside Downing Street, the prime minister said he was "glad" the crew had been returned "safe and unharmed". He said "no deal" had been done with the Iranians to secure the crew's release. He contrasted the rejoicing at the return of the crew with the "sober and ugly reality" of the deaths of four British soldiers in Iraq in what he described as a "terrorist act". However, he said it was "too early to say" whether the UK troops had been killed by Iranian-backed insurgents. The prime minister said the government had pursued a "dual-track strategy" of remaining open to dialogue with Iran, while "mobilising international support and pressure". "In my view it would be utterly naive to believe that our personnel would have been released unless both elements of the strategy had been present." Defence Secretary Des Browne said the navy crew, most of whom are in their 20s, had "acted with immense courage and dignity". De-briefing The navy personnel arrived at Tehran Airport early on Thursday in a fleet of official cars after 13 days in Iranian custody.

33 dead, 15 injured in Virginia Tech shootings
Story Highlights • Witness describes gunman coming back to classroom • University officials say 33 dead, including a gunman • Attacks mark deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history  Adjust font size: BLACKSBURG, Virginia (CNN) -- A gunman who killed at least 30 people in one of two shootings on the campus of Virginia Tech was dressed "almost like a Boy Scout," said a student who survived by pretending to lie dead on a classroom floor. "He just stepped within five feet of the door and just started firing," said Erin Sheehan, who was in one of the Norris Hall classrooms where the second shooting incident took place. Sheehan described the gunman -- who later shot and killed himself, according to police -- as a young man wearing a short-sleeved tan shirt and black ammunition vest. "He seemed very thorough about it -- getting almost everyone down -- I pretended to be dead," she said. (Watch student describe surviving by playing dead ) "He was very silent," said Sheehan, one of only four students in her 25-student German class who were not shot. "We forced ourselves against the door so he couldn't come in again, because the door would not lock." The man tried three more times to force his way in and then began firing through the door, she said. She and about 20 other people took refuge behind a locked door in a teacher's office. (Watch a student's recording of police responding to loud bangs ) "They were telling us to put our hands above our head and if we didn't cooperate and put our hands above our heads they would shoot," Otey said.

Virginia Tech shooter identified, witness reports emerge
Yesterday’s mass shooting at Virginia Tech — the worst in American history — is another horrifying reminder that some of the gravest dangers Americans face come from killers at home armed with guns that are frighteningly easy to obtain. Not much is known about the gunman, who is reported to have killed himself, or about his motives or how he got his weapons, so it is premature to draw too many lessons from this tragedy. But it seems a safe bet that in one way or another, this will turn out to be another instance in which an unstable or criminally minded individual had no trouble arming himself and harming defenseless people. In the wake of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre — in which two alienated students plotted for months before killing 12 students, a teacher and themselves — public school administrators focused heavily on spotting warning signs early enough to head off tragedy. As the investigation of the Virginia Tech shootings unfolds in coming days, it will be important to ascertain whether there were any hints of the tragedy to come and what might be done to head off such horrors in the future. Campuses are inherently open communities, and Virginia Tech has some 26,000 students using hundreds of buildings over 2,600 acres. It is not easy to guarantee a safe haven. The investigations will also need to look into the response by the campus and local police. The initial shootings killed two students in a dormitory around 7:15 a.m., prompting a 911 call and a police response. Tragically, the police assumed that was the end of it and thought the shooter might have left the campus and even the state. Two hours later a second, more lethal round of shooting claimed some 30 lives in an engineering building across campus.

Nearly a dozen killed in suicide bomber attack in Iraq
Taking into account the untapped potential of Iraq's western desert, the war-torn country's oil reserves could be nearly twice as large   A Sunni insurgent coalition announced an "Islamic Cabinet" for Iraq and named the head of al Qaeda in Iraq as "minister of war" in a Web video Thursday aimed at showing their strength in leading the fight against the Iraqi government. Al Qaeda-led Iraqi insurgents issued a video Thursday purporting to show the killing of 20 kidnapped Iraqi police and soldiers, each shot in the head execution-style as they knelt in a row. The Islamic State of Iraq, a coalition of Sunni insurgents including al Qaeda in Iraq, claimed on Saturday to have abducted the 20 and threatened to kill them after 48 hours unless the government freed female prisoners and handed over police accused of a rape. President Bush sparred across the table with Democratic congressional leaders opposed to the Iraq war in a prelude to a veto showdown over a conflict that has claimed the lives of more than 3,200 U.S. troops and tens of thousands of Iraqis. During an hour-long meeting at the White House on Wednesday, the president told lawmakers directly that he will not sign any bill that includes a timetable for withdrawing American forces, and they made it clear Congress will send him one anyway. Iraq's hotly debated draft oil law is to be sent to parliament next week, the country's oil minister said on Wednesday, and CBS News reporter Larry Miller says Iraqis could be sitting on nearly twice as much oil as previously thought, according to a comprehensive new geological study (read more)   A policeman and a civilian woman were killed when gunmen opened fire on a police patrol in Baqouba, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad, police said. An Iraqi soldier was gunned down near Kut, 100 miles southeast of Baghdad, according to officials at a nearby hospital where his body was brought. In the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, 180 miles north of Baghdad, seven employees of the North Oil Company, a state-run enterprise, were seriously wounded in another drive-by shooting, police said. "The clock is ticking," Gates told reporters, saying he will warn Iraqi officials that they must move faster on political reconciliation. "Gates, traveling to Iraq for the third time in four months, took a decidedly stronger tone this time, reflecting U.S. frustration and the political tumult in Washington where President Bush and Congress are deadlocked over whether to set an end date for the war.The defense secretary stressed again, however, that the debate has been helpful in letting the Iraqis know that American patience with the war is ebbing. Democrats have seized on those remarks to bolster their arguments that there must be a deadline for the Pentagon to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq.The last time a U.S. defense secretary visited Fallujah — which until late 2004 was a key stronghold of the Sunni insurgency — it was Donald H. Rumsfeld, who stopped here in December 2005 to announce a plan to begin reducing U.S. troops.

"If common sense doesn't prevail, then where else can you turn?" Damian Hopley, boss of the players' union, told the Daily Telegraph. "The game isn't so much shooting itself in the foot, as blowing off both feet." The dispute between Premier Rugby, the umbrella body for the English Premiership clubs, and the Rugby Football Union, English rugby's governing body, is over shareholding and voting rights in European Rugby Cup Ltd, the organisation behind the Heineken Cup.

High turnout observed in French presidential election
PARIS, April 22 -- French voters Sunday chose ruling party candidate Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist Ségolène Royal to compete in the French presidential runoff in two weeks, with a massive voter turnout backing a generational shift of the country's leadership. Sarkozy, the tough-talking former interior minister and candidate of the Union for a Popular Movement party, won 31 percent of the vote, and Royal, who has cast herself as a maternal protector vying to be France's first female president, received 26 percent, with nearly all of the ballots counted. Eighty-four percent of the 44.5 million eligible voters cast ballots -- an apparent record in a first-round presidential ballot in France -- reflecting the urgency of an election that centered on the country's fear of economic decline at home and diminishing influence abroad. The election results indicate that French voters want a clear choice in the decisive May 6 runoff, which will be a classic right-left showdown pitting the hard-line, pro-business, pro-American Sarkozy, 52, against Royal, 53, who advocates greater spending for social welfare programs and supports more multipolar global relations. Royal, a mother of four, is the first woman to advance to the second round in a French presidential race. "I want to tell all the French who are scared, who are scared of the future, who feel fragile, vulnerable, who find life harder and harder, I want to tell them that I want to protect them," Sarkozy said in a victory speech to supporters at a concert hall near the Champs Elysees. The comments clearly were aimed at voters who tell pollsters they find Sarkozy, the son of a Hungarian immigrant, too tough and divisive. Royal, speaking to boisterous supporters in her voting district town of Melle in southwestern France, said she wanted to lead "the fight for change, so that France can stand up again, to get optimism back." In a clear swipe at Sarkozy -- though she didn't name him -- Royal said she wanted to "change France without brutalizing it." The campaign was dominated by voter calls for change as the domestic economy and job market have stagnated and France's international financial and diplomatic influence is waning. Both Sarkozy and Royal pledged major changes to shake France from its doldrums, and both promise a less imperial presidency that is more in touch with the people.

"What we have cancelled is the first round of voting," Hasim Kilic, deputy head of the court, told reporters. Government spokesman Cemil Cicek said shortly afterwards the cabinet would seek the required attendance of 367 parliamentarians for Wednesday's vote in which Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, a former Islamist, would be the sole candidate. Cicek told a news conference the government was ready to hold early national polls as sought by opposition parties and the business elite, provided parliament agreed to legislation lowering the age threshold for parliamentarians to 25 from 30. The army, which sees itself as the final guarantor of the secular state, has ousted four governments in the last 50 years, most recently in 1997 when it acted against a cabinet in which Gul served.

Bush's veto of Iraq war funding legislation that would force a troop pullout timetable, prompting the start of tense negotiations on a compromise. Bush welcomed somber Democratic leaders to the White House shortly after the veto override attempt failed in the House of Representatives and said he was confident an agreement could be found on a bitterly debated $124 billion war funding bill. "Today is a day where we can work together to find common ground." Democratic leaders called the session positive but insisted their main goal is to find a way to end the four-year-old Iraq war, in which 3,300 Americans and countless Iraqis have been killed. "Whatever our differences, we owe it to the American people to find our common ground. But we must strive to find that common ground," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California.

Ulster Volunteer Force announces it will put weapons "beyond reach"

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/Files BELFAST The Ulster Volunteer Force, the most lethal of Northern Ireland's Protestant paramilitary groups, said on Thursday it would put "beyond reach" weapons it used against Catholics opposed to British rule in the province. "As of midnight, Thursday 3rd May 2007, the Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando will assume a non military, civilianised, role," the UVF said in a statement. "All ordnance has been put beyond reach," it added. The UVF also said it had ended recruitment and military training and instructed members to obey the rule of law. The group, which killed more people than any other Protestant gang during 30 years of sectarian conflict in the province, said its move followed disarmament by the opposing and predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army. London and Dublin welcomed the news five days before politicians from opposite ends of Northern Ireland's sectarian divide begin running the province's day-to-day affairs. "We need to see how today's announcement is translated into action," a spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said. Irish premier Bertie Ahern said the move was "potentially very important" but joined others in pointing out that putting weapons beyond reach was not the same as disarming. When the IRA ended its armed campaign against British rule and so-called 'loyalist' groups such as the UVF, it refused to dispose of its weapons in public but did agree to the presence of independent monitors to verify the scale of decommissioning. The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), headed by retired Canadian General John de Chastelain, said it was ready to work with the UVF. "While we're encouraged by their proposal to end their involvement in paramilitarism, and to reject criminal activity, we are concerned by their intention to deal with their arms without the involvement of the IICD," the commission said. London and Dublin called on the UVF and other loyalist groups to stand down last month after a ceasefire watchdog found that while they had not recently been engaged in "terrorism", some members were involved in violence and crime.

Kenya Airways jet with at least 114 on board crashes
Worried friends and relatives gathered at Kenya's main airport Rescuers in southern Cameroon have resumed searching for a Kenya Airways airliner thought to have crashed on Saturday with 114 people aboard. The flight, which originated in Ivory Coast, is believed to have come down in dense jungle after taking off in heavy rain from Douala en route to Nairobi. Searchers using helicopters are focusing on the Lolodorf area after reports of an explosion there. The missing come from more than 20 countries, including five Britons. The Boeing 737-800 was just six months old and part of a new fleet bought by the airline. The presumed crash will raise questions about whether other aircraft will be taken out of service, the BBC's Karen Allen reports from Nairobi. Kenya's national carrier has a good safety record but 169 people died when one of its planes crashed in 2000. 'Confusion' Flight KQ 507 originated in Abidjan and left Douala, Cameroon, at 0005 on Saturday (2305 GMT Friday), being due to reach Nairobi at 0615 (0315 GMT). The last communication with the missing plane was received by the control tower in Douala, on the coast, shortly after take-off, Kenya Airways said. A distress signal was later sent out by the plane, Kenyan Airways chief executive Titus Naikuni said, adding that this would have been sent out automatically. A BBC correspondent in Lolodorf says the situation there has been chaotic, and heavy rains on Saturday prevented a ground search from taking place. 'Anxious and desperate' Kenyan Transport Minister Chirau Ali Makwere - who is leading a team of Kenya Airways and government officials to Douala - said it was too early to determine what had happened to the plane.

Sarkozy defeated Socialist Party candidate Segolene Royal on Sunday. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier PARIS French president-elect Nicolas Sarkozy disappeared on a retreat with his family on Monday to consider his government line-up and plot strategy for a crucial parliamentary election in June. Sarkozy, a combative conservative, won a strong mandate for political and economic change by winning 53.06 percent of the vote in Sunday's presidential run-off against 46.94 for Socialist Segolene Royal. But he needs to secure a majority in the election for the National Assembly on June 10 and 17 to make good on his vows to loosen rigid labor laws, trim fat from the public service, cut taxes and restore full employment. "We are going to see how we can give him the biggest parliamentary majority possible so he can put into effect his undertakings," Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie told reporters outside Sarkozy's campaign headquarters. Sarkozy left Paris in the morning with his wife and son, after spending the night in a luxury hotel. They arrived unannounced on a private aircraft on the Mediterranean island of Malta, airport sources told Reuters on Monday. "These few days rest were planned to put him more in the mindset of a president after the tumultuous battle," said Claude Gueant, his campaign director. "It will also be a few days to let him reflect on the make-up of his government team," he told RTL radio.

Northern Ireland has home rule returned
Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern saw devolution return Enlarge Image  DUP leader Ian Paisley and Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness took office as first and deputy first ministers as five years of direct rule ended. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern witnessed the creation of the new executive. Mr Blair said that the day's events offered the chance for Northern Ireland to "escape the heavy chains of history" and "make history anew". In October 2002, allegations of intelligence gathering within Stormont led to the suspension of power-sharing institutions. "Look back and we see centuries pock-marked by conflict, hardship, even hatred, among the people of these islands," the prime minister said. Irish Premier Bertie Ahern thanked all the politicians who have been involved in the peace process, but reserved special praise for Mr Blair. Mr Paisley said: "Today we are starting upon the road which I believe will take us to lasting peace in our province." He added: "I welcome the pledge we have all taken to that effect today... that is the rock foundation upon which we must build." Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said he wished Ian Paisley all the best as they began "the greatest, yet most exciting, challenge of our lives". "We must overcome the difficulties which we face in order to achieve our goals and seize the opportunities that now exist," he said. SDLP leader Mark Durkan said: "What today shows is that when finally you have a government setting a deadline and setting terms and keeping to them, you can get somewhere."

Reports: Taliban leader Mullah Dadullah killed in Afghanistan
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, May 13 -- Mullah Dadullah was the face of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan as it used suicide bombings, videotaped beheadings and targeted assassinations to escalate its insurgent campaign over the past two years. Dadullah periodically turned up on television to taunt the Afghan government and U.S.-led international forces with threats of ever more ambitious attacks. On Sunday, his face was on display again, resting on a pink sheet, bloody and lifeless. A bullet hole was visible in the back of his head, with two more piercings in his stomach. Dadullah, the Taliban's top operational commander, was killed Saturday after U.S.-led troops and Afghan forces tracked him down and surrounded him in southern Afghanistan, according to Afghan and international security officials. His death was hailed by those officials as a critical victory in the fight against the Taliban at a time when the extremist Islamic movement has destabilized large portions of the country through Dadullah's uncompromising approach to warfare. "We fully expect Mullah Dadullah will be replaced in time, but for now the insurgency has received a serious blow," said Maj. John Thomas, a spokesman for the NATO-led force that patrols Afghanistan and that supported U.S.-led operations against Dadullah. Thomas described Dadullah as "the top person in our scope in Afghanistan that we were interested in removing." Although the group's overall leader, Mohammad Omar, remains at large, he is believed to play a lesser role in the organization's military operations. A Taliban spokesman denied that Dadullah had been killed, but witnesses who inspected the body as it lay at the governor's palace in the southern city of Kandahar on Sunday identified it as Dadullah's, based on distinctive facial features and a missing left leg. Dadullah boasted in an interview this year that he had deployed 6,000 fighters for a spring offensive and that suicide bombers had infiltrated every major Afghan city. Those claims, however, were widely believed to have been exaggerated, and the offensive has largely failed to materialize.

Five members of US patrol killed; Three missing in Iraq
(AP) In Other Developments: The United States and Iran said Sunday they will hold upcoming talks in Baghdad about improving Iraq's security — a historic political turnabout that comes amid a last-ditch U.S. military and diplomatic push to stabilize the country. Iraqi lawmakers say Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki plans to give Sunnis more say in security operations in their areas. The deal would stave off a threatened Sunni walkout that could have toppled the al-Maliki's embattled government. Lawmakers describe the agreement as an understanding and not a formal pact; similar arrangements have broken down in the past. The deal could help assuage Sunni complaints that security forces dominated by Shiites unfairly target Sunni areas but have not cracked down on Shiite militias linked to influential lawmakers.

During the ceremony the new prime minister said: "I will listen to everyone because a France in motion needs everyone." Afterwards Mr de Villepin emerged from the Matignon, wished Mr Fillon good luck and said: "He has all the necessary qualities to succeed in the service of our country." Mr Fillon served as social affairs minister between 2002 to 2004, pushing through a major overhaul of the country's pension system in the midst of large street protests. He has also served in several other government posts for the UMP party, but lost his place in Mr Chirac's administration in 2005 and pledged his loyalty to Mr Sarkozy. Getting France moving again - Mr Sarkozy sets the pace "There is a demand for change. Never have the risks of inertia been so great for France as they are now in this world in flux where everyone across the world is trying to change quicker than the others, where any delay can be fatal," he said.

Wolfowitz to quit as head of the World Bank
Paul Wolfowitz says he has been the victim of a smear campaign After lengthy talks with the bank's board, Mr Wolfowitz said he would quit the global lending body on 30 June. He had faced widespread calls for his resignation after being accused of a conflict of interest over a pay rise given to ex-bank employee Shaha Riza. The White House, which had backed Mr Wolfowitz, said President George W Bush reluctantly accepted his decision. The bank said it would start an immediate search for his successor. 'Good faith' In a statement, the board of directors said it accepted Mr Wolfowitz's assurances that he had "acted ethically and in good faith" in the handling of Ms Riza's role and remuneration. But it acknowledged that a "number of mistakes" had been made.

He has been under severe pressure for weeks, with a number of European politicians calling on him to step down to prevent the Bank's credibility from being eroded. A spokeswoman for the bank's staff association - which had been at the forefront of calls for Mr Wolfowitz's resignation - said: "He has damaged the institution and continues to damage it every day that he remains as its president." Conflict of interest Mr Wolfowitz came under fire after details emerged about his role in securing a pay rise for Ms Riza, who used to work at the bank.

He is set to call on the international community to prevent Iran enriching uranium on an industrial scale.

Mr ElBaradei has suggested that Iran be allowed to keep part of its enrichment programme. This point of view is at odds with that of the US and of a number of key European governments. The US and other European allies were so angered by Mr ElBardei's "unhelpful comments" that they were expected to deliver a formal complaint. The US described the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s report as "a laundry list of Iran's continued defiance of the international community". Iran has denied hindering the IAEA and said it will "continue to co-operate". In March, the UN Security Council imposed a second round of sanctions on Iran for failing to suspend uranium enrichment, prompting Tehran to limit its co-operation with the agency. The IAEA said its ability to monitor Iran's activities had "deteriorated" "The time has come to look at additional pressure [...] to bring about a change in Iranian calculations."

New Zealander on oxygen machine dies after power disconnection
The oxygen machine was reliant on the electricity supply Folole Muliaga, a 44-year-old mother of four, died within two hours of the electricity being switched off at her home in the northern city of Auckland. Police said they were investigating the circumstances of Mrs Muliaga's death. The power company, Mercury Energy, said it had been unaware any disconnection would put her life at risk. Relatives of Mrs Muliaga, a schoolteacher, said she had been off work since February with a heart and lung condition. Because of this, the family claim, she had fallen behind with her energy bills. 'Deeply sympathetic' When a company representative arrived at the house to disconnect the supply, they said they impressed upon him her dependency on the machine to stay alive. Mrs Muliaga's son Letitaia, 20, said the employee showed no compassion. "He said he is here doing his job and he's here to cut the power off," he was quoted by local media as saying. Paramedics were called but she died within two hours of the power being cut, he added. Mercury Energy said it was "deeply sympathetic" about the death, but disputed that its contractor had been made aware of Mrs Muliaga's condition. "We were simply unaware that loss of electricity to the household was putting a vulnerable customer at risk," general manager James Moulder said. "I do think it is important that the facts are established before people rush to judgement," he said.

This was "one of the most chilling plots imaginable," Roslynn Mauskopf, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said at a news conference in New York. "The devastation that would be caused ... is just unthinkable." The plotters sought to blow up the airport's jet fuel tanks and part of the 40-mile (64-km) pipeline feeding them from New Jersey. Three of the four suspects, who included a former airline cargo handler, have been arrested, federal law enforcement officials said. In a recorded conversation one suspect predicted there would be few survivors and that the attacks would result in the destruction of "the whole of Kennedy." In one recorded conversation, a suspect compared the plot to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, "Even the twin towers can't touch it." Targets in the airport plot included terminal buildings, aircraft and fuel tanks, as well as the fuel pipeline to the airport.

Paris Hilton released under house arrest
Paris Hilton was released from prison today after serving just three days of her 45-day sentence, but has been placed under house arrest. The socialite and hotel heiress, jailed for driving offences, was admitted to the Century regional detention facility in Los Angeles just after 11.30pm on Sunday. Hilton had originally been sentenced to 45 days in jail, but this was reduced to 23 for good behaviour. At 2:09am on Thursday morning, Hilton, 26, was "reassigned" to the LA County probation department for medical reasons, and fitted with an electronic tag as part of her punishment. Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the LA County sheriff's department, said the decision to transfer Hilton was taken after "extensive consultation with medical personnel" but would not comment on what those medical issues were. Hilton's lawyer, Richard Hutton, said his client had been doing well after her first night in jail "under the circumstances" on Monday. Hilton has now been fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet and will serve the remainder of her 45-day sentence at her home. She has 40 days left, as the LA authorities have counted Sunday night and Thursday morning towards her sentence. Rumours of Hilton's early release were posted on celebrity gossip website TMZ early this morning and the sheriff's department confirmed Hilton's release at a press conference this afternoon. The actor, author, model and star of reality TV show, The Simple Life, pleaded no contest (a guilty plea) in January to charges of alcohol-related reckless driving and was sentenced to three years' probation. She was stopped by the California highway patrol for speeding in February and charged with violating her probation. Hilton turned herself into the authorities on Sunday night, almost walking off the red carpet at the MTV movie awards in Hollywood and going straight to the detention centre. Critics and friends of Hilton have been debating how her stay in prison will affect her career. She is reported to have been paid $500,000 (£251,200) to keep a prison diary, but others fear the short spell will finish her lucrative career.

North Korea fired... REUTERS/Jo Yong-Hak SEOUL North Korea fired up to two short-range missiles off its west coast on Thursday, said U.S. and South Korean officials, prompting quick U.S. criticism of Pyongyang over the second such launch in as many weeks. The launch occurred a day after U.S. President George W. Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed at a bilateral meeting there were limits to their patience with Pyongyang's failure to honour a nuclear disarmament agreement. "What I have been advised is that it (was) a cruise missile test," White House National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley told reporters. "We saw I think in the last week or 10 days a similar test." A South Korean Defence Ministry official confirmed reclusive communist North Korea had fired at least one missile but could not specify the exact number or type. White House National Security spokesman Gordon Johndroe said North Korea's missile test activity was "not constructive" and Pyongyang should focus on dismantling its nuclear programme. "The United States and our allies believe that North Korea should refrain from testing missiles," Johndroe said in a statement to reporters on the sidelines of a Group of Eight (G8) summit in Heiligendamm, Germany. BARRAGE North Korea fired a barrage of long and short range missiles last year, triggering United Nations sanctions. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged fellow G8 leaders to keep up the pressure on North Korea over its nuclear programme, Japanese officials said on Thursday. "We cannot allow the development of nuclear weapons by North Korea," one official quoted Abe as saying at the opening of a working lunch. Pyongyang has refused to implement a February 13 deal with South Korea, the United States, Russia, China and Japan under which it agreed to begin shutting down its nuclear programme in return for energy aid.

White House press center evacuated after bomb scare
WASHINGTON The press center across the street from the White House was briefly evacuated on Monday after a bomb-sniffing dog prompted a security check of an Israeli vehicle, U.S. officials said. The temporary filing center is around the corner from Blair House, where dignitaries often stay. Security was already tighter because of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's visit from Monday. Secret Service spokesman Darrin Blackford said a dog singled out a vehicle parked on Jackson Place, in front of the press quarters.

The area was given the "all clear" about an hour and 40 minutes after the 2:50 p.m. incident. Secret Service spokeswoman Kim Bruce told CNN the service evacuated the area, including Lafayette Park, Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House and the press center at Jackson Square, "out of an abundance of caution," but the White House itself was not evacuated.

'Purity' ring case taken to High Court
LONDON A teenage schoolgirl will appeal to the High Court on Friday to overturn a ban on her wearing a "purity ring" at school to symbolize her decision to abstain from sex before marriage. Lydia Playfoot, 16, from West Sussex, says the silver ring is an expression of her faith and should be exempt from the school's rules on wearing jewellery. "It is really important to me because in the Bible it says we should do this," she told BBC radio. "Muslims are allowed to wear headscarves and other faiths can wear bangles and other types of jewellery. It feels like Christians are being discriminated against." Playfoot's lawyers will argue that her right to express religious belief is upheld by the Human Rights Act. There have been a series of rows in schools in recent years over the right of pupils to wear religious symbols or clothing, such as crucifixes and veils. That case echoed a debate in France over the banning of Muslim headscarves in state schools. 4:3-4," a reference to a Biblical passage from Thessalonians which reads: "God wants you to be holy, so you should keep clear of all sexual sin." Lydia's father, Phil Playfoot, said his daughter's case was part of a wider cultural trend towards Christians being "silenced." "What I would describe as a secular fundamentalism is coming to the fore, which really wants to silence certain beliefs, and Christian views in particular," he said.

Mr Blair said nothing to the press as they got in the car, but wife Cherie smiled and waved at the press and said she would not "miss" them. Earlier MPs from all sides called a halt to the usual House of Commons hostilities to pay tribute to him during Mr Blair's final half hour question time session. Mr Blair admitted he had "never pretended to be a great House of Commons man" but he paid tribute to the "noble" work of MPs and - in his final words to Parliament - said: "I wish everyone, friend or foe, well and that is that, the end." MPs gave departing Mr Blair a standing ovation Mr Blair, who was being watched from the public gallery by his family, also paid tribute to troops killed in Iraq. He hailed Britain's armed forces as the "bravest and the best" and said he was "truly sorry about the dangers they face today in Iraq and Afghanistan".

Two men were arrested after ramming a burning car into the airport's main terminal, a day after police thwarted two attempted bombings in the capital. Police said the incident was being treated as terror related. Later, two more arrests were made on the M6 in Cheshire in connection with the two incidents. He told BBC News 24 that three cars straddled the motorway and brought traffic to a halt. In front of them were a couple of other unmarked police cars and they forced a car onto the hard shoulder and got the occupants out and as far as I can see arrested them," he said. Strathclyde Police told a news conference the attack on Glasgow Airport was now being linked to the car-bomb plot in London - foiled by police on Friday. Mr Brown thanked the emergency services for their professionalism Airport attack was terrorism Your pictures: Glasgow alert Chief Constable Willie Rae said: "There are clearly similarities, and we can confirm that this is being treated as a terrorist incident."

Leahy: Congress willing to 'go to court' over W.H. subpoena standoff
The White House won't release documents on domestic surveillance or allow aides to testify on US attorney firings. A flurry of subpoenas is pushing Congress and President Bush toward a historic clash over executive powers that could wind up in the courts. For now, lawmakers are targeting two issues: the dismissal of nine US attorneys and the Bush administration's authorization of warrantless domestic surveillance. If the president does not comply with these subpoenas Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy said he will seek to cite the White House for criminal contempt of Congress. But the outcomes of these disputes also could tip the balance of powers between Congress and the executive branch for a generation. "It feels like a climactic moment," says Julian Zelizer, a congressional historian at Princeton University. "The Bush administration has been about presidential power since they took office – even before 9/11." "We've seen a push by Vice President Cheney to reverse everything that happened in the 1970s and fully restore the powers of the presidency. At issue is whether lawmakers have a right to question, under oath, two senior White House aides on the attorney firings, which critics say were motivated for improper political reasons or to squelch ongoing corruption investigations. If subpoenas for two former aides to testify are not withdrawn by the response date of July 12, Mr. Bush will also cite executive privilege in not permitting them to appear, said a senior administration official in a briefing last week. "For the president to perform his constitutional duties, it is imperative that he receive candid and unfettered advice," said White House counsel Fred Fielding, in a letter to the Senate and House Judiciary committees last week.

Further arrests following terror attacks in London and Glasgow
Police have continued to search the Royal Alexandra Australian media reports have identified the man as Dr Mohammed Haneef, aged 27, who was detained while trying to board a plane to India. It brings the number of people held to eight. In addition, Australian police are interviewing a second doctor. 'Precautionary' explosions Controlled explosions have been carried out on a car at a Glasgow mosque and at a station in Hammersmith, west London. British Transport Police said explosives experts performed a controlled explosion on three fire extinguishers left on a pavement outside Hammersmith Tube station, which serves the District and Piccadilly lines. Three explosions were also carried out on the car in Glasgow as a precaution, but Strathclyde Police said there had been "absolutely no specific information" regarding a threat. Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Australian police there had acted on information from the UK authorities. The man detained at Brisbane airport was an Indian national who had been trying to return to India with a one-way ticket, he added. Australian Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said police had executed search warrants at the Gold Coast Hospital in Southport, eastern Queensland - where the detained doctor worked as a registrar - and at other locations across the state. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie said the detained man had been working at the hospital since September, and that he had been based in Liverpool when he answered an advert in the British Medical Journal in March 2006. Mr Beattie said a second doctor, also recruited from Liverpool, was being interviewed by police. In Scotland, the Lord Advocate approved the transfer of two men, who had been held in a high security police station in Govan, to the Met.

Poll of 100 million votes names new Seven Wonders of the World
The world's most wondrous wonder is actually the computer. Millions of people from across the globe joined in what was essentially a huge publicity stunt, voting via the Internet to choose a new list of the Seven Wonders of the World, announced Saturday. And the seven winners, announced on the seventh day of the seventh month in the year '07, were: The Great Wall of China, the ancient city of Petra in Jordan, the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Machu Picchu in Peru, the Maya ruins of Chichen Itza in Mexico, the Colosseum in Rome and India's Taj Mahal. The lucky seven represented a collection of mystical, centuries-old places and more modern constructions of limited transcendence -- chosen in a decidedly unscientific poll. "We are celebrating the cultural diversity of our world," proclaimed actor Ben Kingsley, co-host of a glitzy ceremony late Saturday in Lisbon's Stadium of Light, where the winners were announced amid highly orchestrated fanfare. The popularity contest was the creation six years ago of Bernard Weber, a Swiss filmmaker and self-styled adventurer. Nearly 200 early candidate sites chosen by Internet balloting were scaled down by a panel of experts to 21 finalists, each from a different country, from Greece's Acropolis to the Statue of Liberty. Nothing prevented repeat voting by fans, citizens, governments, tourism agencies, you name it. Weber promoted the project with flashy appearances in hot-air balloons, on camelback and inside a blue blimp, traveling to each of 21 final candidates. In developing countries where the Internet is taking off, such as China, millions of people enthusiastically cast votes for their favorite monuments. Since the Great Wall was one of the candidates (and a winner), it was an easy guess just where most of those votes went.

Face-off at Islamabad Mosque
Troops are blocking all entrances and roads to the mosque Ejaz-ul-Haq said the militants were "hardened terrorists" holding women and children hostage inside the Red Mosque. The Pakistani army has kept a tight grip on the mosque, also known as Lal Masjid, since fighting began last week. The mosque's leader, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, said he and his followers would commit suicide rather than surrender. An army commander was shot dead by students inside the mosque on Sunday. At least 21 people have been killed since the stand-off began last Tuesday. Abdul Rashid Ghazi said as many as 1,800 followers remained in the mosque, although this cannot be verified. 'Al-Qaeda links' Mr ul-Haq told the BBC that between two and five of the militants were wanted in connection with "high-profile cases". Mr ul-Haq said the government became aware of the militants' presence after a man killed on the first day of the siege was identified as Maqsood Ahmed, a member of Jaish-e-Mohammad, an outlawed radical Muslim organisation which has been linked to al-Qaeda. Ahmed was wanted in connection with an assassination attempt against Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in the northern Pakistani town of Attock in 2004. He says those inside are students of his religious school and he is in charge.

US Immigrants protest Green Card delays with flowers
Shyam Bindingnavale had spent years of anguish in pursuit of permanent residency, so when the government offered him an opportunity to apply for it and then abruptly snatched it away, he was furious and deeply disappointed. Bindingnavale, 36, a Gaithersburg resident and financial analyst working here on an H1B visa for skilled technical workers, struck back the most effective way he could imagine: He sent flowers to Emilio Gonzalez, the director of the U.S. So did about 200 other green card applicants, most of them professionals, natives of India and working legally in this country. They did it because that's what Gandhi would have done. Yesterday, their bouquets of purple roses, pink lilies and yellow daisies, which cost about $40 each and which were sent from all over the country, piled up on the immigration office's loading dock at 20 Massachusetts Ave. NW, addressed to Gonzalez and stacked in columns taller than people. "We know the reason behind it and understand the symbolism. We donated them in the same spirit in which they were provided to us," said an agency official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lawsuit over the matter filed by an advocacy group. The idea for the protest began with the Indian immigration community on the online forum Immigration Voice, a site devoted to issues facing skilled, legal workers seeking permanent residence in the United States. Their method was inspired by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who spent years campaigning nonviolently for India's independence from Britain. Green card applicants were given hope on June 12, when the State Department posted a bulletin offering H1B visa holders who had been stuck in a bureaucratic logjam an opportunity to take that last step needed to apply for permanent residency. Thousands of engineers, doctors and other educated foreigners began a mad scramble to file their applications before the July 2 deadline.

New gambling review could jeopardize UK's 'supercasino' plans
Manchester put forward the winning bid for the UK's first super-casino Whitehall sources told the BBC the idea of using a super-casino to regenerate run-down areas was "dead in the water". The PM promised a report on the "social effects" of gambling by September. But Manchester MP Graham Stringer said it would be a "weak and bad decision" if the city's successful bid to build the first super-casino was overturned. 'No consensus' During prime minister's questions, Mr Brown was told by Labour MP Andy Reed that most people thought super-casinos would make gambling addiction worse. The prime minister replied the issue would be "subject to reflection over the next few months".

Tour de France: Michael Rasmussen wins stage 8
By Martin Gough  Rasmussen has been King of the Mountains in the last two years Denmark's Michael Rasmussen went it alone for victory in Tignes to secure the Tour de France yellow jersey. Rasmussen, who began the day 39th overall, was part of a breakaway halfway through the 165km eighth stage. He went solo on the last climb to finish two minutes and 47 seconds ahead of Iban Mayo and 5:04 clear of Linus Gerdemann, now second overall. Alexandre Vinokourov and Andreas Kloeden both lost 4:29 while Michael Rogers crashed out of the race. T-Mobile leader Rogers was in the same group as Rasmussen - and the race leader on the road - on the descent of the Cormet de Roseland when he hit a roadside barrier. 606: DEBATE There's plenty of time to consider strategy over the rest day FR He bravely carried on before being forced to pull up later with a dislocated shoulder. "It's a real shame because I could see the yellow jersey," he said. "One moment I was in the lead, the next I was lying on the ground with my back wheel where my front wheel should have been." O'Grady was taken to hospital after a crash on the same descent as Rogers while McEwen, who won the first stage in Canterbury last Sunday, was eliminated from the race after finishing outside the 40-minute time limit. X-rays showed that O'Grady broke five ribs in the fall, as well as fracturing three vertebrae and a shoulder blade. This could be my year as the Pyrenees are extremely difficult but, again, I need to improve in the time trials Michael Rasmussen After a stage which included three category-one climbs, Rasmussen also took the lead in the King of the Mountains competition, which he has won overall for the last two years. Asked if he would aim to take the yellow jersey in Paris in a fortnight's time he said: "The way I'm riding, I would be stupid not to."

Documents show Fred Thompson worked for Pro-Choice group
Giuliani tries new campaign strategy by nurturing relationships with reporters and driving coverage with his own message. Giuliani catches up on organization After months of tough press and a corresponding drop in his once-soaring poll numbers, Rudy Giuliani’s campaign has put a new strategy in place, nurturing relationships with reporters and trying to drive coverage with its own messaging. Mastering some of the basic fundamentals of the modern presidential campaign simply hasn't come easily for Giuliani, who started his quest much later than his GOP peers and has sometimes seemed to have difficulty adjusting to the umatched scrutiny of a run for the White House. Story Continued Below But the campaign of the former New York mayor seems to be finding its equilibrium. Just this week, the campaign has e-mailed 24 press releases, research documents and advisories to the national media—about twice as many as it would have sent in any given week earlier in the year. Also this week, the campaign began sending a daily e-mail alerting reporters to the message of the day and Giuliani’s schedule. Additionally, campaign staff have engaged individual reporters on a near-daily basis, seeking to get ahead of the news cycle. Perhaps most important, the campaign has started bracketing news announcements with complementary messaging designed to drive home Giuliani's agenda. Rather, his campaign held a press conference Tuesday unveiling his “Justice Advisory Committee,” a group of lawyers whose purpose is to reassure conservatives of the pro-choice candidate’s intentions. When Giuliani spoke about his promise on Wednesday, the campaign reinforced the message by posting a column on the topic exclusively on PajamasMedia, a popular conservative website. This blocking and tackling goes hand-in-hand with running for president in 2007, but the forward-leaning approach is new for a national frontrunner whose campaign infrastructure has not matched his standing in the polls.

AKP secures mandate in Turkish general election
By Sarah Rainsford BBC News, Ankara  Unofficial results prompted wild street celebrations by supporters Turkey's powerful military warned it would intervene to protect the republic, if required. This Sunday, 46.4% of the electorate cast their votes for the AKP across the country, proving they did not believe in any such danger. It was a resounding victory and, as the results rolled in, there was euphoria at the brand new party headquarters in the city. Hundreds of people thronged outside, waving orange and blue party flags. There was singing and dancing in the streets. Passing cars were draped in party flags too, passengers hanging out of the windows. It will be very good for Turkey," said Sadi, one of the supporters. He voted for the AKP so democratic reforms would continue, moving Turkey closer to the European Union. So does this second term success mean Turkish society is becoming more religious and more introverted? "Today nearly half of the people voted AKP, and half of all people here do not want Turkey to be an Islamic society," he explained.

Major earthquake strikes Peru followed by multiple large aftershocks
Peru quake kills 500, bodies in streets Updated Peruvians pulled hundreds of dead and wounded from the rubble of homes and churches overnight and some gathered them on street corners after a massive earthquake ravaged the country's central coast. About 500 people were killed and a further 1,600 injured in the 8.0-magnitude quake on Thursday, the president's chief of staff said. As rescuers scrambled through the debris in search of survivors, dazed residents guarded bodies in the street, not sure where to take them. The US Geological Survey upgraded the quake's magnitude to 8.0 from an earlier 7.9 measurement, and powerful aftershocks rattled the country. Many mud-brick houses crumbled, residents placed the bodies of relatives and neighbours on street corners and hospitals were overwhelmed with injured in Chincha and the nearby city of Pisco. On the road into Chincha, which lies 200 kilometres south of the capital Lima and is home to some 170,000 people, fuel tanks and merchandise were spilled onto highways where trucks had turned over when the quake buckled the pavement. Wounded people lay on the floor in Chincha's San Jose hospital, where walls were destroyed by the quake. Prisoners escape Hundreds of prisoners ran out of Chincha's Tambo de Mora prison, an old building that collapsed during the earthquake. It was really hard to control all the prisoners," Manuel Aguilar, vice president of Peru's prison authority, said. In the San Juan de Dios hospital in Pisco, doctor Ricardo Cabrera said staff was struggling to cope with 200 wounded and more than 40 dead, with no power and a large part of the hospital damaged. "There are a lot of bodies still in the rubble," Dr Cabrera told RPP radio, calling for blood, bandages and medicines.

Jose Padilla found guilty of supporting terrorism
MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Former Chicago gang member Jose Padilla was found guilty Thursday of supporting Islamic terrorism overseas. Jose Padilla was originally accused of planning a "dirty bomb" attack in the United States. Co-defendants Adham Hassoun and Kifan Jayyousi were also found guilty of the three counts charged: conspiracy to murder, kidnap, and maim people in a foreign country; conspiracy to provide material support for terrorists; and providing material support for terrorists. Padilla was originally arrested on accusations that he planned to set off radioactive "dirty bombs" in the United States. Thursday's convictions are not related to those accusations, and prosecutors did not present the "dirty bomb" plot to the jury. A federal court jury in Miami deliberated for just under two days before handing down the verdict. "They've had enough," said court clerk Ivan Marchena. Watch latest news of Padilla verdict from CNN's Susan Candiotti » All three defendants face life in prison when they are sentenced on December 5. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales -- who is on vacation this week -- issued a statement saying, "The conviction of Jose Padilla -- an American who provided material support to terrorists and trained for violent jihad -- is a significant victory in our efforts to fight the threat posed by terrorists and their supporters." "We commend the jury for its work in this trial and thank it for upholding a core American principle of impartial justice for all," the statement said. Defense attorneys argued at trial that Padilla went overseas only to study Islam. Padilla's mother, Estela Lebron, told CNN her son will appeal the verdict. "I'm not surprised by anything in this place anymore," she said.

Plane flying from Cyprus to Istanbul, Turkey hijacked
ANKARA, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) -- Most of the passengers on the hijacked aircraft of the AtlasJet which was heading for Istanbul from the northern Cyprus, managed to flee from the plane at Antalya Airport in southern Turkey on Saturday, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported. Sources were quoted as saying that Turkish security forces began releasing elderly passengers and children on board as a result of negotiations with two hijackers after the plane was landed at the airport for refueling.

An important part of them managed to get out, said the sources, adding that some passengers were injured. Sources also said that the hijackers are still holding nine passengers and two crew members as hostages. The hijackers wanted to fly the plane to Iranian capital city of Tehran after it took off from the Ercan Airport in Nicosia in northern Cyprus at 07:15 a.m. local time (0415 GMT), according to the report. One of the hijackers was speaking Arabic and had a knife and the other was carrying a package that he claimed to be a bomb, Anatolia reported. Other media reported that the two hijackers claimed they were from al-Qaida, an escaped passenger told NTV television. When pilots said they needed to refuel, the hijackers tried to storm the cockpit but they could not manage it, Anatolia said, adding that they took one of the hostesses hostage and threatened to harm her. The plane later landed at an airport in the southern Turkish city of Antalya for refueling and the pilots left the airplane, said the report. There are 136 passengers and six crew members on board the plane, operated by the private Turkish airline company Atlas Jet, it added. Passengers jumped from the plane's exits Passengers flee plane The Atlas Jet plane was flying from Northern Cyprus to Istanbul when the two men tried to divert it to Iran.

Volatile stock market, credit woes persist
A sign over the floor of the at the New York Stock Exchange August 16, 2007. U.S. stock index futures pointed to a higher open on Wall Street on Monday, as Friday's cut by the Federal Reserve in the interest rate it charges for lending to banks boosted investor confidence. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid NEW YORK Stocks fell on Monday, led by losses in financial companies, as worries about spillover from the subprime mortgage market lingered despite the Federal Reserve's surprise discount rate cut on Friday. U.S. one-month Treasury bill yields dropped to their lowest since December 2004, while Thornburg Mortgage TMA.N Chief Operating Officer Larry Goldstone said there was a crisis in investor confidence in the mortgage sector. The U.S. central bank's emergency move to stabilize credit markets followed sharp declines in world stock markets in recent weeks as problems in the risky U.S. subprime mortgage sector spread to other markets. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is scheduled to meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd to discuss the recent volatility in the financial markets, Dodd said. "I think there was too much complacency coming into the market today," said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. "There's still a number of potential shoes that could drop" in the mortgage and credit markets.

Forest fires burn on in Greece; death toll nears 50
The fires spread rapidly, catching many people unawares Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis said the country had to "mobilise all means and forces to face this disaster". Officials say 47 people have died and many others may be trapped on the Peloponnesian peninsula. A 65-year-old man has been charged with arson and murder relating to a fire which killed six people in Areopolis. And in the northern city of Kavala two youths have been detained on suspicion of arson. Blackened skies The BBC's Malcolm Brabant, in Pyrgos, says radio stations are being inundated with calls from people in remote mountain villages saying they are surrounded by fire. We are living through an unspeakable tragedy today Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis In pictures: Forest fires Witnesses tell of fire horror Meanwhile, many bodies have been taken to a mortuary in the city of Patras. Strong winds have blown smoke and ash towards Athens 330km (200 miles) away, starting more fires and blocking out the sun over the capital. "No-one has the right to take human lives and destroy the environment... to destroy our country," said Mr Karamanlis. Most of the dead came from villages near the town of Zaharo, on the west coast of the Peloponnesian peninsula.

Horse flu spreads in Australia
Flu crisis spreads to Randwick Updated Australia's horse flu crisis deepened this morning when symptoms were reported in thoroughbred racehorses for the first time. All track work has been stopped at Sydney's Randwick Racecourse after three horses developed higher than normal temperatures. One of the horses involved is from the stable of star trainer Gai Waterhouse while another is being trained by 'Cups King' Bart Cummings. Racing New South Wales spokesman Peter V'Landys says no chances are being taken. "We have spoken to the chief veterinarian and organised to have those horses tested immediately and for the tests to go out to the Menangle government laboratory for analysis," he said. "It's a precaution, these horses have got elevated temperatures. "Two of the horses have only got slightly elevated temperatures, but in the current circumstances we're not prepared to take any risks whatsoever." More cases in Warwick At least 10 horses at the Morgan Park site in Warwick, in southern Queensland, are now showing signs of the virus, but vets there have not yet confirmed a flu diagnosis. Blood samples have been sent to a laboratory in Victoria and the results are not expected until later this week. In New South Wales, 47 horses were confirmed with the disease before the latest cases at Randwick. Queensland Racing chairman Bob Bentley has called for an inquiry into the outbreak, which has brought the racing industry to its knees. Mr Bentley says industry officials are working on a plan with the Queensland Department of Primary Industries that would provide exclusion zones for owners wanting to work their horses.

U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales resigns
Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, one of President Bush's closest confidants and a key architect of his controversial counterterrorism policies, announced yesterday that he is quitting after seven months of bitter confrontation with Congress over his honesty and his competence to run the Justice Department. His resignation, submitted Sunday to President Bush and disclosed yesterday, removes one of the nation's most controversial attorneys general since the Watergate era. He will leave behind a Justice Department battered by allegations that partisan politics has infected its law enforcement mission. Gonzales had long been a lightning rod for critics of the administration's harsh interrogation policies, its secret overseas prisons and its expanded domestic surveillance -- all supported by legal analyses conducted under his supervision or with his concurrence. The events that led to his resignation began with a Democratic-led inquiry into those firings, and they included accusations that Gonzales had lied to lawmakers. Most of his senior aides have already departed, and Congress is now locked in conflict with the White House over its access to documents related to Gonzales's decision-making. Gonzales will be replaced temporarily by Solicitor General Paul D. Clement, and Bush could name a permanent nominee for the job by the end of this week, White House officials said. Lawmakers began floating names of possible replacements yesterday, but administration officials insisted that no candidate has been tagged. With unwavering support from Bush, his longtime mentor, Gonzales long defied demands from lawmakers of both parties that he step aside. But within the past week, Justice aides and other officials said, Gonzales concluded that his credibility with Congress, his employees and the public was so shattered that he could not promise to remain through the end of Bush's term, as the White House chief of staff had demanded of Cabinet officers. Gonzales, a son of migrant workers and the nation's first Hispanic attorney general, gave no reason for his departure during a brief news appearance in Washington, emphasizing his "remarkable journey" from a poor childhood in Texas to the height of power in Washington. Bush told reporters yesterday that he accepted Gonzales's resignation reluctantly, casting his friend as the victim of "months of unfair treatment that has created a harmful distraction at the Justice Department."

Iran unveils part of its nuclear program
The World Tehran sharing more nuclear data, agency says Iran is still enhancing its effort to enrich uranium but the endeavor falls well short of capacity, a U.N. report declares. But U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran's network of nuclear facilities masks a clandestine effort to obtain technology that could be used in the making of an atomic bomb. They have threatened to impose a fourth round of sanctions on Tehran when the United Nations Security Council takes up the issue again, probably next month. Iran insists that its nuclear program is meant to meet its civilian energy needs. In theory, about 3,000 centrifuges operating at full capacity for a year could produce enough material to make one bomb. Iran says it has mastered the technology and that a plant in the city of Natanz has the capacity to operate 50,000 centrifuges. Experts doubt these claims. According to the report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran operates 1,968 centrifuges for producing enriched uranium that could ultimately be used to make nuclear weapons or generate electricity, a 50% increase over the number it had on line in April. However, the uranium has been enriched to only 3.7%, far less than the 90% estimated to be necessary for weapons-grade material. CAIRO — Iran continues to expand its ability to enrich uranium, but is operating far below capacity and cooperating more fully in clearing up questions about its efforts, a U.N. report said Thursday. The report warns, however, that Iran needs "to continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of its present and future nuclear program."

Adventurer Steve Fossett missing
By David Willis BBC News, Nevada  The airport in Minden is serving as a base for the rescue effort Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft took turns to taxi down the narrow runway. More than a dozen are playing their part in the hunt for Steve Fossett. I took a flight in a small Cessna aircraft over the area from which Steve Fossett took off on Monday. It is high desert dotted with mountain valleys and ravines. Spotting the millionaire adventurer and his single-engine blue and white plane would be a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack. High winds have also hampered the search effort making it difficult for planes to fly low enough for their pilots to peer into the gulleys. No signal Since Steve Fossett did not file a flight plan the search area is immense - more than 600 sq miles (1,554 sq km). Maj Cynthia Ryan, of the Civil Air Patrol, said it could take a week to search the entire area. She is confident Steve Fossett will be found, although when I put it to her that his silence seemed ominous she agreed. Given Steve Fossett's experience - he has circumnavigated the globe no fewer than five times - the question is how could a freak joyride have gone so wrong? Steve Fossett not only had plenty of fuel when he set out, he also had with him a radio and a cell phone, and the aircraft was fitted with an electronic beacon. Maj Ryan said no signal had been received from the beacon, which suggested that it had either developed a fault with the battery, or been destroyed or submerged in water. Millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett, who has cheated death time and again in his successful pursuit of aviation records, was missing Tuesday after taking off in a single-engine plane the day before to scout locations for a land-speed record, officials said. Teams searched a broad swath of rugged terrain in western Nevada near the ranch where he took off, but searchers had little to go on because he apparently didn't file a flight plan, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said.

2007 Rugby World Cup: New Zealand, Australia and England open with wins
By James Standley  Winger Sitiveni Sivivatu grabbed a first-half brace for the All Blacks New Zealand (43) 76 Tries: McCaw 2, Howlett 3, Muliaina, Sivivatu 2, Jack, Collins 2 Cons: Carter 7, McAlister 2 Pens: Carter McCaw 2, Howlett 3, Muliaina, Sivivatu 2, Jack, Collins 2Carter 7, McAlister 2Carter Italy (7) 14 Tries: Stanoevic, Mirco Bergamasco Cons: Bortolussi, de Marigny Favourites New Zealand laid down a World Cup marker by destroying Italy in their opening game in Marseille. Richie McCaw (2), Doug Howlett, Mils Muliaina and Sitiveni Sivivatu (2) scored before Marko Stanojevic crossed for Italy to make it 43-7 at the break. The All Blacks added further tries through Chris Jack, Howlett (2) and Jerry Collins (2), before Mirco Bergamasco grabbed a consolation try. Star All Blacks fly-half Dan Carter landed 17 points with the boot. Italy have a reputation as a physical, abrasive unit but they were taken apart by the All Blacks in a devastating opening quarter. New Zealand have a history of peaking between World Cups but since losing in the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament they have won 38 of their 43 Tests. 606: DEBATE They thrilled the passionate 60,000 crowd at Olympique Marseille's Velodrome stadium by performing their traditional pre-match Ka Mate haka, rather than the Kapa O Panga haka they have used frequently over the past couple of years. The Italians chose to spurn the challenge by going into a group huddle and they seemed to turn their backs once again just 60 seconds into the game. All Blacks second row Ali Williams peeled round the back of a line-out and New Zealand captain McCaw romped over untouched from the 22. McCaw, the IRB player of the year in 2006, added his second try just six minutes later before two Carter conversions and a penalty put the tournament favourites 17-0 up after just 11 minutes. Italy looked shell-shocked and a panicky kick soon landed in the hands of the lethal Sivivatu, who sparked a sweeping passing move ended by Howlett in the far corner. The battered Azzurri tried to respond by imposing themselves physically, but twice Carter saw their blitz defence coming, twice he chipped over the thin blue line and twice the All Blacks scored. Muliania and Sivivatu were the lucky recipients and, with Carter maintaining his 100% success rate with the boot, the tournament favourites had 38 points on the board after just 18 minutes.

2007 Rugby World Cup: South Africa, Wales, Scotland and Ireland win
Wales finally won enough ball to allow their backs to show their class Wales (9) 42 Tries: Parker, AW Jones, Williams (2), Charvis Cons: Jones (4) Pens: Hook (3) Parker, AW Jones, Williams (2), CharvisJones (4)Hook (3) Canada (12) 17 Tries: Cudmore, Culpan, Williams Cons: Pritchard  Wales survived a huge scare in their opening World Cup match before overcoming a determined Canada side. Canada led 17-9 after 45 minutes in Nantes after tries from Jamie Cudmore, Craig Culpan and Morgan Williams. But the introduction of Stephen Jones and Gareth Thomas sparked Wales to life as they dominated the last half hour. Sonny Parker, Alun Wyn Jones, Colin Charvis and Shane Williams (2) crossed to ensure the victory which had looked a distant dream for the Welsh side. Wales, wearing black armbands in honour of former Welsh Rugby Union president Sir Tasker Watkins who died on Sunday, lined up in unfamiliar grey jerseys. And the dullness of their shirts was matched by their play in the opening exchanges as they struggled to find any cohesion. 606: DEBATE Gareth Jenkins is no clearer in knowing exactly his best XV BBC Sport's Nabil Hassan They at least managed to force Canada to concede penalties in their own half, and James Hook kicked three of his four attempts to put Wales 9-0 up after 15 minutes. A scrum deep in Wales 22 provided the perfect attacking platform, and Cudmore eventually barged his way over from a few yards out as Wales buckled under heavy pressure. Wales were left stunned 10 minutes later as Culpan ran almost the length of the field to score Canada's second try. Wales had looked destined to score as a break by centre Tom Shanklin put Canada on the back foot, but Hook's attempted long pass was intercepted by Culpan and the centre had enough pace to race home.

General Petraeus: 30,000 troops may be able to leave Iraq by next summer
Gen. David Petraeus told Congress on Monday he envisions the withdrawal of roughly 30,000 U.S. troops by next summer, beginning with a Marine contingent later this month. In long-awaited testimony, the commanding general of the war said last winter's buildup in U.S. troops had met its military objectives "in large measure." As a result, he told a congressional hearing and a nationwide television audience, "I believe that we will be able to reduce our forces to the pre-surge level ... by next summer without jeopardizing the security gains we have fought so hard to achieve." Petraeus unleashed a volley of numbers to support his claim the surge is working, reports CBS News national security correspondent David Martin. He said the number of attacks in Iraq is lower than at any time in more than a year; civilian deaths are down by 45 percent; and sectarian killings are down by 55 percent. But the charts show violence is still high, running at levels comparable to 2005, before the bombing of the Samarra mosque triggered sectarian fighting that nearly tore Iraq apart, adds Martin. Testifying in a military uniform bearing four general's stars and a chestful of medals, Petraeus said he had already provided his views to the military chain of command. Rebutting charges that he was merely doing the White House's bidding, he said firmly, "I wrote this testimony myself. It has not been cleared by nor shared with anyone in the Pentagon, the White House or the Congress."

2007 Rugby World Cup: Tonga, Fiji and Italy win
Finau Maka crossed over for Tonga in the first two minutes USA: (3) 15 Tries: MacDonald, Stanfill Con: Hercus Pens: Hercus Tonga: (13) 25 Tries: Maka, Vaka, Vaki Cons: Hola 2 Pens: Hola 2 Tonga got their World Cup campaign off to a winning start with victory over a battling USA in Montpellier. The Americans found themselves 13-0 down after 26 minutes thanks to an early try from Toulouse flanker Finau Maka and two Pierre Hola penalties. Eagles prop Mike MacDonald made the score 13-8 with a try in the corner but Tonga responded through Joseph Vaka. USA flanker Louis Stanfill then crossed from close range but Viliami Vaki's superb score sealed victory for Tonga. The result was a disappointing one from America's point of view following on from their impressive display against England last weekend. 606: DEBATE They seemed to be feeling the effects of the quick turnaround and Tonga made an explosive start with Toulouse's Maka going over after a rolling maul from a line-out after 72 seconds. America settled however and restricted the combative Tongans to just two Hola penalties in the rest of the opening half. The Eagles, boosted by a Hercus penalty just before the break, dominated for long periods of the second period and twice got back to within a score of their opponents. MacDonald powered his way over to score in the corner on 46 minutes but Tonga responded with the help of an incisive break from skipper Nili Latu which led to Joseph Vaka scoring his first try for his country. America had renewed hope when Stanfill bundled over from his own tap penalty but Vaki struck the decisive blow with 10 minutes left - leaving the Eagles ruing their wasted opportunities. It's not often you get the chance to play in a World Cup and it's a good feeling to get a victory.

UK bank gets emergency support
Some customers were queuing outside Northern Rock branches But experts and officials insist that Northern Rock, which has £113bn in assets, is not in danger of going bust. Despite the reassurances lines of customers formed outside many Northern Rock branches around the UK. The bank has struggled to raise money to finance its lending ever since money markets seized up over the summer. Stock market hit NORTHERN ROCK FACTS Founded in 1965 after merger of Northern Counties Permanent Building Society and Rock Building Society Headquarters in Newcastle Became a public company in 1997 Has 6,400 staff Has 18.9% share of new UK lending Loans and assets of £113bn Deposits from customers of £24bn Northern Rock's share price What if a bank goes bust? Other bank shares fell, with Bradford & Bingley, Alliance & Leicester and HBOS down nearly 8%, 7% and 4% respectively. Northern Rock said that its profits for 2007 would be hit, but that it remained solvent. Unlike most banks, which get their money from customers making deposits into savings accounts, Northern Rock is built around its mortgage business. It raises most of the money which it provides for mortgages by borrowing from banks and other financial institutions. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Chancellor Alistair Darling said: "The problem here is there is a lot of money in the system but they are reluctant to lend it to each other at the moment." Queues at branches Mr Darling said that "in order to create a stable banking system, the Bank [of England] steps in and it makes facilities available to the Northern Rock." Angela Knight, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, said that anybody who was "either a saver with Northern Rock or has got a mortgage... can be absolutely confident that they have got their money with or they have borrowed from a very sound financial institution."

Chris Langham given ten months for downloading child porn
Chris Langham was convicted in August on 15 charges Actor Chris Langham has been jailed for 10 months for downloading indecent videos of children from the internet. The Bafta-winning star of comedy dramas Help and The Thick Of It wept as he was sentenced at Maidstone Crown Court. He was convicted last month on 15 charges. Some of the videos accessed by Langham, 58, of Golford, Kent, showed the most "horrific level" of abuse. Langham will serve five months in prison, less the 43 days he has spent in custody already. One of the victims was about eight years old and others were aged between 11 and 13, according to Judge Philip Statman. The worst video was 15 minutes long and it showed in quite graphic detail the sadistic brutalisation of an eight-year-old girl in the UK Det Ch Insp Paul Fotheringham Langham's future behind bars He told Langham: "Some of the children viewed are clearly prepubescent, others are fully developed, some of the children are clearly of Filipino extract. He added: "Your activity took place in the comfort of your own home, no doubt at the time feeling safe in the knowledge that you would never be caught." During his trial at Maidstone Crown Court Langham admitted viewing them but pleaded not guilty because he did not want to be labelled a paedophile. 'Abusive situations' Det Ch Insp Paul Fotheringham said: "Fifteen [images] is reasonably low to be honest, most police forces have probably had cases where they've had people with hundreds of thousands of images. "The worst video was 15 minutes long and it showed in quite graphic detail the sadistic brutalisation of an eight-year-old girl in the UK, with some serious sexual offences against her."

By James Standley  Jerry Collins enjoyed the chance to get his hands on the ball in space New Zealand: (52) 108 Tries: Rokocoko 2, Toeava, Williams, Mauger 2, Collins, Masoe, Hore, Leonard, Evans, Ellis, MacDonald, Smith 2, Hayman Cons: Evans 14 Rokocoko 2, Toeava, Williams, Mauger 2, Collins, Masoe, Hore, Leonard, Evans, Ellis, MacDonald, Smith 2, HaymanEvans 14 Portugal: (3) 13 Tries: Cordeiro Cons: D Pinto Pens: D Pinto Drop-goals: Malheiro New Zealand ran in 16 tries as they brushed aside Portugal in Lyon. Joe Rokocoko (2), Isaia Toeava, Ali Williams, Aaron Mauger, Jerry Collins, Chris Masoe and Andrew Hore went over for the All Blacks in the first half. Portugal managed a converted Rui Cordeiro try to add to Goncalo Malheiro's earlier drop goal. The Portuguese, 22nd in the world, had eagerly awaited their opportunity to meet the world's top ranked team and they visibly relished the chance to face the haka. Italy had spurned the challenge when they met the All Blacks and conceded a try within two minutes, but Portugal held out twice as long before Rokocoko scythed through to score. The winger soon added a second try, but the next score went to Portugal as Malheiro, their all-time record points scorer, drilled over a fine drop-goal. The All Blacks, the tournament favourites, said they would be "sensitive" up against a largely amateur team, but conceding points was not part of the deal and the drop-goal had the same effect as poking a wasps' nest. New Zealand started to swarm over Os Lobos and, in the last 18 minutes of the first half, added further tries by Toeava, Williams, Mauger, Collins, Masoe and Hore. Amazingly, the first score of the second half went to Portugal as Cordeiro finished off a series of close-range drives. Duarte Pinto duly kicked the conversion to put the minnows within 42 points. But Leonard rapidly hit back for the All Blacks and, although Portugal defended bravely, Evans, Ellis, Mauger, MacDonald, Smith, who grabbed a double, and Hayman all crossed as the floodgates opened once more. Evans converted 14 tries and claimed a personal haul of 33 points as New Zealand finished well short of the record 145 points they ran up against Japan in 1995. "We started a little slower than last week and that was credit to the Portuguese but we got into a rhythm.

2007 Rugby World Cup: Fiji, Tonga and France win
By James Standley  Saracens winger Kameli Ratuvou was a constant threat for Fiji Fiji (15) 29 Tries: Leawere, Ratuvou 2, Delasau Cons: Little 3 Pens: Little Leawere, Ratuvou 2, DelasauLittle 3Little Canada (6) 16 Tries: Smith Cons: Pritchard Pens: Pritchard 3 Fiji kept in the hunt for a place in the World Cup quarter-finals with a bonus-point win over Canada in Pool B. Tries from Kele Leawere, Kameli Ratuvou and Vilimoni Delasau helped them into a 22-6 lead. Canada hit back, with Ryan Smith's try and James Pritchard's third penalty trimming the gap to six points. But Ratuvou's late try ended Canada's hopes as Fiji stay on course for what is likely to be a winner takes all contest against Wales on 29 September. The game was always going to be a clash of styles, with Canada relying on their forward strength and a more structured approach to combat Fiji's greater pace, power and skill out wide. However, Fiji tried to take Canada on with a deliberate game initially, kicking several penalties for touch, and a penalty apiece from James Pritchard and Nicky Little saw the sides level at 3-3 after the early exchanges. Fiji were making little headway until Saracens winger Ratuvou, playing at full-back for Fiji, injected some pace into the game. First he sliced through to within a couple of yards of the line before losing the ball in a tackle. A couple of minutes later he smashed his way through the first line of defence and when Fiji switched play to the right, second row Leawere was on hand to blast over by the posts. Little converted to make it 10-3 and although Pritchard narrowed the gap with his second penalty after 26 minutes, within two minutes Fiji had stretched their lead as Ratuvou once again stamped his mark on the game. Number eight Sisa Koymaibole's charge took Fiji within sight of the line and Ratuvou burst over from close range to make it 15-6 at half-time. The Fijians might be just one place higher than Canada in the world rankings at 12th, but whenever they secured decent possession they looked much more threatening. When winger Delasau got his hands on the ball veteran Canadian prop Rod Snow was all that barred his way to the line and he stepped him with ease. However, they hit back just before the hour mark when Smith slipped Little's tackle to score from close range after a sustained attack, with Pritchard's conversion making it 22-13.

Meteorite blamed for mysterious illness in Peru
Reports on a small Peruvian town’s plight over the past few days include more than a few elements to boggle the mind — and then to make you wonder whether an episode of “The X-Files” is playing out in real time. (To set the spooky mood, just watch this short video.) Stunned residents said they tracked it to a fresh hole in the earth that was more than 60 feet wide, 15 feet deep, filled with boiling water and steaming with noxious fumes, according to a statement from the Health Ministry. And then people started getting sick: more than 150 reported symptoms like dizziness, vomiting and skin lesions, according to a government statement quoted by Bloomberg News. The Associated Press reports that a local official confirmed through tests that a “rocky meteorite” created the crater. But a meteorite expert at the Natural History Museum in London, who was interviewed by BBC News, said that “increasingly we think that people witnessed a fireball,” which she said would not be uncommon, and that the hole in the ground was unrelated. After seeing the fire in the sky, the local people “went off to investigate, and found a lake of sedimentary deposit, which may be full of smelly, methane-rich organic matter,” Dr. Caroline Smith suggested. “This has been mistaken for a crater.” A NASA scientist interviewed by Space.com agreed, saying of the steaming pond that “statistically, it’s far more likely to have come from below than from above.” Adding to the confusion, the scientist concedes that the meteorite explanation was not impossible, but he would expect it to be a metal one, not the rocky one identified by tests at the scene. The local official who confirmed the meteorite strike also said that the water in the crater was boiling for 10 minutes, a detail that first emerged from witnesses in what appears to be the first English-language article about the incident, from Agence France-Presse. “And this is where the story falls apart,” a blogger at Wired writes, adding to that explanation in a post that started off, “Shades of the Andromeda Strain! How cool is this!” He continues: Mid-sized meteorites are not hot.

Maoists quit joint-government in Nepal
KATHMANDU: Even as pressure mounted on Nepal prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala to woo the Maoists back into the government and avert a crisis, a day after the rebels quit the government and trained their sights on the November election, reconciliation talks among the eight parties on Wednesday failed to appease the rebels. Though the leaders of the remaining seven parties in the ruling alliance said the parleys had been positive, the meeting started on a stormy note with Maoist supremo Prachanda staying away initially. Though scheduled to have started from 2 pm, the talks began almost two hours late sans Prachanda. After he finally made an appearance, the meet ended with an agreement to continue the talks. However, no date has been fixed for the next round of talks despite the gravity of the situation and with the constituent assembly election only 63 days away. One of the rebel leaders, Chandra Prakash Gajurel, who heads the Maoists' foreign affairs division, said at a public programme in the capital on Wednesday that his party would start collecting signatures for a campaign to convene parliament, bring a no-trust motion against Koirala and have two-thirds of the MPs declare Nepal a republic with the abolition of monarchy. Other party leaders however said that there was no immediate plan to do so but the step could be taken at an appropriate time. The pullout is the most serious setback to peace moves since the Maoists ended a 10-year insurgency last year.

By Rob Hodgetts  Giteau scored a brace and kicked 17 points for Australia Australia (22) 55 Tries: Giteau (2), Mitchell (3), Ashley-Cooper, Hoiles Cons: Giteau (4) Pens: Giteau (3) Drops: Barnes Giteau (2), Mitchell (3), Ashley-Cooper, HoilesGiteau (4)Giteau (3)Barnes Fiji (5) 12 Tries: Neivua, Ratuva Cons: Bai Cons: Lemi Australia romped to a comfortable 55-12 victory over a second-string Fiji in the Pool B clash in Montpellier. The Wallabies ran in seven tries to secure top spot in the group, setting up a likely quarter-final against either England or Tonga in Marseille. Fiji scored tries from Isoa Neivua and Aca Ratuva but the Wallabies were in training mode ahead of bigger tests. "It was a little bit scrappy in the first half, but we showed we are able to defend well at times," said man-of-the-match Giteau, who also kicked 17 points and won his 50th cap. "Fiji defended well and put us under pressure. Hopefully we will have a good performance against Canada and get ready for the quarter-finals." The Fijians, who were resting a host of top players, can still qualify for the knock-out stages if they beat Wales in the crunch match Nantes on 29 September. "We thought we had a few chances at end of first half to chase the score and I was pleased with the younger players coming through, knowing that we've got a tougher game against Wales next week," said Fiji coach Ilie Tabua. Australia took their time to unlock the Fiji defence and had to wait until 16 minutes for the first try after Wycliff Palu and Lote Tuqiri combined to put in Giteau. 606: DEBATE The Wallabies went close soon after when George Gregan, equalling Will Carling's record of 59 caps as captain, was foiled yards from the line after Rocky Elsom's break, but Fiji, to their credit, held off the next Australia score until the half hour mark. Full-back Chris Latham slipped a cute grubber kick through for winger Mitchell to gather and five minutes later Giteau added a second when he sneaked through following sustained Australian pressure. The Wallabies were cruising but right on the whistle, a textbook Fijian passing move down the three-quarters picked out left wing Neiuva, who outmuscled five Australian defenders to crash over. After the break, the hard-headed Australians spurned the chance to probe the corner with a penalty and took three more points through Giteau before Berrick Barnes added a drop-goal for good measure. Fiji, though, were not prepared to go through the motions as understudies and a dazzling break from replacement Mosese Raulini fed open-side Ratuva for his side's second try.

2007 Rugby World Cup: Georgia claim first World Cup victory
By James Standley  Fly-half Merab Kvirikashvili (right) turned in a fine display for Georgia Georgia (13) 30 Tries: Guiorgadze, Machkhaneli, Kacharava Cons: Kvirikashvili 3 Pens: Kvirikashvili 3 Guiorgadze, Machkhaneli, KacharavaKvirikashvili 3Kvirikashvili 3 Namibia (0) 0 Georgia claimed their first-ever World Cup victory as they defeated Namibia in wet conditions in Lens. Merab Kvirikashvili landed two penalties and converted Akvsenti Guiorgadze's try to put the Lelos 13-0 up at the break. Kvirikashvili then kicked a third penalty and a conversion after Irakli Machkhaneli engineered a fine solo try. Georgia won the inaugural meeting between the two sides 26-18 in June and they had the upper hand from the first whistle in northern France on Wednesday night. Namibia, in the south west of Africa, is generally hot and dry and their national side had reportedly not played in the rain for over 30 years. Georgia looked more comfortable from the start and they opened the scoring in the seventh minute after inside centre Irakli Giorgadze burst through the Namibian midfield. 606: DEBATE Namibia infringed at the resulting ruck and fly-half Kvirikashvili, who plays for French second division side Pau, landed the penalty. Namibia were struggling to get into the game and when they failed to find touch Malkhaz Urjukashvili counter attacked and took Georgia deep into Namibia territory. After a couple of phases they moved the ball to Kvirikashvili but his grubber kick between the posts ran dead before any of the Georgian chasers could get to it. The fly-half missed a second penalty after 23 minutes but two minutes later he was on target to give them a 6-0 lead. Georgia rarely looked threatened but right winger Giorgi Shkinin's inability to cope with any ball kicked at him was proving a handicap. When he dropped his third kick in a row it put the Eastern Europeans in deep trouble and they conceded a penalty for holding on at a ruck.

The All Blacks were in dominant form with two tries apiece for Sitiveni Sivivatu and Isaia Toeava. Romania tried hard but their only try came after 31 mintues through hooker Marius Tincu. The All Blacks set out their intentions from the start with the first of Sivivatu's tries coming with less than a minute on the clock. 606: DEBATE From then on it was one-way traffic as the Romanians had no answer to New Zealand's fast attack and the All Blacks built up a 31-0 lead after 25 minutes. Romania showed some determination to take more from the contest early in the second half but the relentless All Blacks could not be contained. Rokocoko completed his hat-trick in the second half and his side finished with a flourish with replacement Doug Howlett stretching his all-time New Zealand try scoring record to 49. With four wins out of four, the All Blacks will travel to Cardiff next weekend in confident mood to play France, Argentina or Ireland in the quarter-finals. "Overall we're pretty pleased, and we had no injuries, which is a pretty big plus.

2007 Rugby World Cup: Argentina and France qualify for quarter finals
By James Standley  Yannick Jauzion showed some sublime touches for France France (23) 64 Tries: Poitrenaud, Nyanga, Beauxis, Dominici 2, Bruno, Nallet, Martin, Bonnaire Cons: Beauxis 5 Pens: Beauxis 3 Poitrenaud, Nyanga, Beauxis, Dominici 2, Bruno, Nallet, Martin, BonnaireBeauxis 5Beauxis 3 Georgia (0) 7 Tries: Maisuradze Cons: Khamashuridze World Cup hosts France beat Georgia but the victory was not enough to help them avoid a quarter-final against favourites New Zealand in Cardiff. The win meant France briefly went top of the group but Argentina's win over Ireland relegated them to second place. France must now travel to Wales while Argentina, whose victory over the hosts in the first match of the tournament set them on their way to topping Pool D, will meet Scotland in Paris in the last eight. In the end it was a game too far for Georgia, who have lit up the World up with their never-say-die attitude. They won their first ever World Cup match when they downed Namibia and also came within inches of shocking Ireland, but there was nothing left in the tank in Marseille on Sunday. France took an early lead through a Beauxis penalty and he added the conversion after the classy Yannick Jauzion made a superb outside break to set up Poitrenaud, who glided over for the opening try. Georgia never gave up but France were ultimately too strong Beauxis, who scored 24 points in all, landed two further penalties either side of a missed penalty attempt by fly-half Merab Kvirikashvili for Georgia and France ran in two more tries before the break. Nyanga crossed down the blindside for the first before Beauxis went over after a neat scissors with Poitrenaud. Beauxis converted both scores to put France 30-0 up at the break and they scored their fourth try, earning a bonus point in the process, when Dominici latched onto the fly-half's inch-perfect cross-kick. Sale hooker Bruno marked his arrival with a score before Dominici latched onto a neat Jean-Baptiste Elissalde kick to grab his second. Nallet and Martin extended the lead before Zviad Maisuradze powered over for a converted try from a quick tap penalty to give the Georgian fans something to cheer about. There was a sour note late on, with Otar Eloshvili lucky not to be sent off after a shocking spear tackle on Martin, but overall Georgia's time in France has been a triumph.

Thousands of trapped miners rescued in South Africa
The miners could only be brought to the surface in small groups The final group was lifted to safety from Elandsrand mine, 80km (50 miles) from Johannesburg, officials said. The accident had left the miners trapped 2.2km (1.4 miles) underground. The miners were brought out through a small shaft normally used for mining equipment. Only 75 workers could be hauled clear at a time, adding up to no more than 300 in an hour. 'Room for improvement' One of the last miners brought to safety, Richman Maneli, told AFP news agency he was happy to be out. "It has been 30 hours of suffering," he said. "We had no food, no water and we are exhausted." Earlier, another rescued miner, Granny Makad, told South Africa's Mail and Guardian newspaper many of the trapped miners were crying and believed they would die underground.

Darfur rebels threaten to pull out of peace talks
"Trust is being lost," says Andrew Natsios Andrew Natsios said the atmosphere between the governments of north and south Sudan had become poisonous. He said the Comprehensive Peace Agreement had to be addressed before the situation deteriorated further. The CPA is seen as a key factor in achieving resolution of the conflict in the Darfur region. At least 200,000 people have died and some two million forced from their homes during the four-year conflict in Darfur. Talks between Khartoum and rebel groups over Darfur are scheduled to begin in the Libyan capital on 27 October, although on Saturday a key rebel leader threatened to boycott them. 'Tension rising' Mr Natsios said it was hoped when the 2005 governmental peace deal was signed that the two enemies in war would be partners in peace. But he said that had not happened and described the governments of north and south Sudan as opponents unable to resolve their differences. Mr Natsios said: "We are deeply concerned with the health of the CPA. The important deadlines have been missed... and trust is slowly being lost." He said tensions, particularly along the border areas where armed units confront each other, were rising. Meanwhile, key rebel leader Khalil Ibrahim has threatened to boycott the Darfur peace talks if more than two rebel groups are invited. Mr Ibrahim, head of the Justice and Equality Movement (Jem), said only his group, a united Sudan Liberation Army and the government should participate. The BBC's Amber Henshaw says many fear the talks are doomed from the outset because the factions are not united and another key leader, Abdul Wahid al-Nur of the Sudan Liberation Army, is refusing to take part.

At least 150 militants and 50 Pakistani troops killed in clashes
Lahore, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani air force planes swooped down on the country's troubled tribal region on the border with Afghanistan Tuesday, launching a blistering airstrike that left as many as 50 militants dead, Pakistan Army sources said. The strike in the Miran Shah region was the latest salvo in intense fighting between Pakistani security forces and Taliban and al Qaeda militants that broke out Saturday, as the summer cease-fire crumbled even further. Those battles -- in North Waziristan, part of the country's largely lawless tribal region -- killed up to 150 militants, as well as 50 government troops, an army spokesman said. Another 20 security forces have been wounded. Intelligence sources said 12 to 15 soldiers remain missing. According to the army spokesman, the military operation, which was launched Sunday, will continue until peace is completely restored to North Waziristan. Pakistani officials offered few other details about the scope of the latest fighting which follows recent attacks on Pakistani security forces and a breakdown over the summer of a ceasefire between the Islamabad government and tribal leaders. That truce was blamed for an increase in attacks on U.S. troops over the border in Afghanistan, as Taliban fighters were able to prepare, train, and reconstitute weapons supplies without interference from the Pakistani government. The Taliban are the former Afghan regime that sheltered al Qaeda until the U.S.-led war following the September 11, 2001 attacks. U.S. intelligence officials say al Qaeda has established a "safe haven" in Waziristan, just over the border into Pakistan -- and that Osama bin Laden is believed to be in the area. American and NATO troops pushed the terrorist network and its Taliban allies out of power in Afghanistan following the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, but top leaders -- including al Qaeda mastermind bin Laden -- are believed to have found refuge in the mountainous border zone. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, cracked down on al Qaeda militants and arrested many in the Waziristan area before the truce was reached, but critics say he has failed to prevent the militants from gaining strength within the country. Tens of thousands of Pakistani civilians are fleeing a town on the border with Afghanistan following three days of fighting which has killed up to 250 people, locals and military officials said today. About 90% of the population of Mir Ali, a town of 50,000 people in the lawless north Waziristan region, has fled the fighting using cars and tractors or on foot, a local man told the Reuters news agency.

Shootings in Cleveland high school leave five injured, gunman dead
(CNN) -- It was only after a crowd of screaming students ran past Darnell Rodgers in a stairway at his Cleveland, Ohio, high school Wednesday afternoon that he realized he had been shot.

Police have started to piece together what happened. ET, 14-year-old gunman Asa Coon, who was a student at the school, walked the halls firing a gun in each hand, Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath said. When it was all over, five people had been shot, but the only fatality was Coon, who police said killed himself in a classroom. Police found a .22- caliber revolver and .38-caliber revolver near Coon's body, along with a box of ammunition and three knives, said McGrath.

Anti-terrorism raids in New Zealand
One of those arrested was Maori rights campaigner Tame Iti More than 300 police were involved in the operation, reportedly targeting Maori sovereignty and environmental activists - not foreign groups. Police Commissioner Howard Broad said those arrested had used firearms and other weapons at military-style training camps. The North Island raids were the first use of the country's Terrorism Suppression Act. The people targeted were from "a range of motivations" and from various ethnicities, the police chief said. "Based on the information and the activity known to have taken place, I decided it was prudent that action should be taken in the interests of public safety," Mr Broad said. Months of planning Armed police raided camps in the eastern Bay of Plenty, as well as a number of addresses in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Palmerston North and Hamilton, police said. One of the videos reportedly showed a military-style training exercise with live ammunition being fired in mountainous terrain. New Zealand's Prime Minister Helen Clark said she was briefed on the planned police raids last week. Asked if she was surprised by the police information, she said: "Yes and no.

Australia Votes 2007: Liberals promise personal income tax cuts
Coalition keeps up pressure on Labor over tax Updated John Howard and Peter Costello have used a visit to a small business in the marginal New South Wales electorate of Eden-Monaro to push the Coalition's plan to progressively reduce the tax rates. Mr Costello says the Coalition is the only party to release a plan for Australia's economic future and he is continuing to pressure Labor to release its tax plan. Mr Howard says the Coalition's $34 billion proposal will encourage more people into work, or to start their own business. "Our tax plan is not just about putting extra dollars in the pockets of middle Australia but it's very much about further growth of the Australian economy," he said. Deputy Opposition Leader Julia Gillard says Labor will not be bullied into rushing out a tax policy, saying that John Howard took his time in 1996. "We know of course Mr Howard when he was opposition leader didn't announce his tax plan until weeks into the campaign," she said. "The big end of town has to be happy with Peter Costello's $34 billion tax cuts, but it's the wrong way for Australia," he said. The Government today unveiled its first major campaign pledge,$34 billion in tax cuts over three years.

Turkish Parliament approves military action in Iraq
The vote came as relations between the countries were strained by a House committee’s passage last week of a bill calling the World War I-era mass killing of Armenians an act of genocide. In a nod to Turkey’s importance as an ally in Iraq, Congressional leaders began to back away on Wednesday from a commitment to hold a vote on that bill. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We are at a defining moment in Turkish-American relations,” said Morton Abramowitz, the American ambassador to Turkey during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, commenting on the Turkish vote. “This is a very big warning sign to the Americans and to the Iraqi Kurds.” Security experts here and in the United States agreed that Turkey was unlikely to cross the United States with a full-scale military operation. Still, the government is closer than it has been in years to military action of some sort, embarrassed into acting by a public angry over mounting deaths and what is seen as American inaction. More than two dozen Turks, some of them civilians, have been killed in cross-border rebel attacks in the past several weeks, and the powerful Turkish military which, unlike the government, has long been pressing for action, is fanning public anger.

'Large-scale attack' against ex-Prime Minister Bhutto leaves more than 100 dead in Pakistan
KARACHI, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 136 people were killed and more than 387 wounded around midnight Thursday in a suicide bombing near a motorcade carrying former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who returned to the country earlier in the day after eight years of self-imposed exile, according to hospital and police sources. Bhutto, recently returned to Pakistan, is helped from her vehicle following the bombing. more photos » Bhutto and those with her were unhurt, and her companions said she reached her family home safely. Video footage showed her exiting the bullet- and blast-proof vehicle after the blasts. Pakistan's president, Gen.

She apparently had moved from the roof of the vehicle inside and downstairs just moments before the blasts. "I can see body parts strewn all over the road," said CNN's Dan Rivers, at the scene. Authorities believe the suicide bomber was on foot and threw a grenade to attract attention before setting of the second, major blast, Karachi police chief Azhar Farooqi told CNN.

Two-horse race likely for leadership of UK Liberal Democrats
Nick Clegg will formally announce his bid to run for the Liberal Democrat leadership today, having already signed up more than twice as many MPs as his rival, Chris Huhne. The home affairs spokesman, regarded as the frontrunner in the race to succeed Sir Menzies Campbell, received a boost yesterday as the manifesto coordinator, Steve Webb, stood aside in his favour. Mr Webb's backing will help Mr Clegg ensure he cannot be portrayed by supporters of Mr Huhne as a rightwinger. But some senior Liberal Democrats are disappointed that Mr Webb, regarded as one of the party's leftwingers, is not standing. Lord Ashdown has also backed Mr Clegg. It is understood the former leader tried to persuade him to stand in the last leadership contest. Eighteen of the 63 Lib Dem MPs told the Guardian they would nominate the home affairs spokesman, while eight said they would back his rival. Mr Webb said he had the support of enough MPs to get on the ballot, but the "huge cost" to his family, and Mr Clegg's qualities, had persuaded him not to run. He added: "I believe that my work with colleagues on our policy platform has given us a firm foundation as a party.

Calls made for prosecution in light of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 report
Garuda pilots face jail if found guilty Updated Indonesian police say they are gathering evidence to pursue manslaughter charges against the two pilots who survived the crash of a Garuda plane earlier this year. Five Australians were among the 21 people killed when Garuda flight 200 crash-landed in March. The pilots, if found guilty, could face up to five years in jail. A spokesman for Indonesia's National Police, Sisno Adiwinoto, has said that two out of five requirements must be met before Garuda flight 200's pilots, Marwoto Komar and Gagam Rachman, can be named as suspects in negligently causing the deaths. Witness testimony, expert witness testimony, suspect testimony, documents and physical evidence or clues can all be drawn on to build a criminal case against the pilots, but only two of these are required to name the pilots as suspects. A damning report by Indonesia's National Transport Safety Committee or NTSC points to pilot errors, and Inspector General Adiwinoto says the case will proceed if enough evidence is found. Police will not have access to the primary evidence gathered by the NTSC. The families of the Australian victims are preparing a class action and Mr Downer says the Government is happy to talk to them about their plans. "You're dealing with the Indonesian system here, it's a different system from our own, so it's not necessarily going to be very easy," he said. "But I think our first priority is to make sure that those who are responsible for this accident, who survived the accident, be brought to justice, that's my priority."

Bush says missile shield "urgently" needed to counter Iranian threat
President George W. Bush speaks at the National Defense University in Washington October 23, 2007. Bush said on Tuesday a planned missile shield in Europe is vital to protect against an ''emerging Iranian threat'' as he pressed an escalating U.S.-led campaign against Tehran.... REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque WASHINGTON President George W. Bush said on Tuesday a planned missile shield in Europe is vital to protect against an "emerging Iranian threat" as he pressed an escalating U.S.-led campaign against Tehran. Laying out his position in the clearest terms so far, Bush used a policy speech at the National Defense University to hammer home the theme that Iran poses a grave danger because of its simultaneous pursuit of nuclear and missile technologies. Bush's latest verbal salvo followed his stark warning last week that a nuclear-armed Iran could lead to World War Three, a remark that drew criticism from political opponents at home who accuse him of stoking tensions with Tehran. "The need for missile defense in Europe is real, and I believe it's urgent," Bush said. "Iran is pursuing the technology that could be used to produce nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles of increasing range that could deliver them." Bush sought to reassure Russia that it need not fear U.S. plans to locate components of the anti-missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, and said Iran would be the key target of such a shield. Western countries accuse Iran of seeking to build atomic bombs under cover of a civilian program. Bush has said he wants a diplomatic solution, although he has not ruled out military action if all else fails. His efforts to win U.N. backing for a third round of sanctions against Iran have faced resistance from Russia and China, veto-holding members of the Security Council. Russia has said it is not convinced Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons or that it will pose a serious missile threat anytime soon.

The United States had cautioned Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf against declaring emergency rule and urged him on Saturday to stick to his pledge to hold free elections... REUTERS/Mian Khursheed WASHINGTON The United States had cautioned Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf against declaring emergency rule and urged him on Saturday to stick to his pledge to hold free elections early next year. "This action is very disappointing," said White House National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe. "President Musharraf needs to stand by his pledges to have free and fair elections in January and step down as chief of army staff before retaking the presidential oath of office," Johndroe added. Musharraf imposed emergency rule on Saturday in a bid to reassert his flagging authority against challenges from Islamist militants, a hostile judiciary and political rivals. "All parties involved should move along the democratic path peacefully and quickly," Johndroe said. Earlier, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, while on a visit to Turkey, said she was "deeply disturbed" by Musharraf's declaration of emergency rule, calling it a step backward for democracy. "The U.S. has made very clear that it does not support extra-constitutional measures as they would take Pakistan away from the path of democracy and civilian rule," Rice told reporters as she was taking off from Turkey. "We will be urging the commitment to hold free and fair elections be kept and we will be urging calm on all parties," she said while en route to Jerusalem. Rice said she had spoken multiple times recently to Pakistan's leaders as had other Bush administration officials and expressed strong U.S. reservations about declaring emergency rule. She said she had not spoken to Musharraf since he made the announcement on Saturday. "I am not going to provide the details of those discussions except to say we made very clear that extra-constitutional means would not be supported by the United States," said Rice.

Rights have been suspended, media has been restricted and hundreds of people arrested under the emergency decree. Mr Aziz said 400 to 500 "preventative arrests" had been made so far, and said the emergency, imposed by Gen Musharraf on Saturday, would last for "as long as is necessary". Small protests have started in the capital, Islamabad, where police and security forces are on the streets surrounding key sites. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said Washington is reviewing the aid which it gives to Pakistan in the wake of Gen Musharraf's decision. "Obviously we are going to have to review the situation with aid, in part because we have to see what may be triggered by certain statutes," Ms Rice said. "Some of the aid that goes to Pakistan is directly related to the counterterrorism mission," Ms Rice said, adding that that complicated the issue.

Paula Radcliffe makes comeback and wins New York City marathon
Radcliffe was running in her first marathon for over two years Radcliffe twice tried and failed to shake off the Ethiopian as the race reached its climax, and her great rival briefly threatened to snatch victory. But the 2004 winner put in a final burst to leave Wami behind and broke the tape in 2hrs 23 mins and 9 secs.

Italy arrests reputed Mafia boss Lo Piccolo
Sicily's Cosa Nostra yesterday suffered a dizzying blow with the arrest of the mafia don regarded as the successor to Bernardo Provenzano, the "boss of bosses" seized last year. Salvatore Lo Piccolo, 65, was captured when police raided a "godfathers' summit" in the hills above Palermo. His son and two other top mafia bosses were arrested with him. The prosecutor who oversaw the operation warned it could unleash a power struggle within Cosa Nostra. Some organised crime experts pointed to a "baby boss" in his 20s as a likely contender for the top job. Among signs of instability in the world's most fabled crime syndicate was that Lo Piccolo was said by investigators to have been betrayed by his own chief "enforcer". As the convoy of police vehicles hurtled towards the entrance, officers wearing face masks gave "V for victory" signs to applause from a crowd outside. An elite squad of police and paramilitary Carabinieri had earlier surrounded a house near the town of Giardinello where the top don was meeting with two other fugitive "godfathers", Andrea Adamo and Gaspare Pulizzi. While the arrests were made, police said, a weeping Alessandro Piccolo cried out: "I love you, dad."

Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the committee, had announced his opposition several days ago. “Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey’s personal assurance that he would enforce a future, a new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to pass one,” Mr. Leahy said today. “Unsaid, of course, is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of the president.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Now, I wish I could support Judge Mukasey’s nomination,” Mr. Leahy said at another point. We have many things in common in our past careers. I certainly don’t question his intellectual ability or his independence.” But Mr. Leahy said the Justice Department needs “an attorney general who believes and understands that there have to be limitations on executive power.” Before he voted “no,” Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, “We need a leader who will inspire confidence in the rule of law. We need a leader who is unafraid to speak truth to power. We need a leader who is worthy of the trust we place in our attorney general to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Michael Mukasey, regrettably, is not that leader.” Photo The committee’s ranking Republican, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he too had been dissatisfied with some of Mr. Mukasey’s responses to questions about torture and the limits on presidential power and that he looked forward to more Congressional deliberations on those issues. “But all factors considered, I think that the balance is decisively in favor of confirming Judge Mukasey,” Mr. Specter said. “If he is confirmed, I believe he will take steps to depoliticize the Department of Justice and to help restore the integrity and credibility that was so lacking under his predecessor,” the Nevada Democrat said. “However, given our recent history, it is of crucial importance that our next attorney general be able to stand up to the president and for the rule of law.

Illegal drug found to be used in the manufacture of toys
(Recasts with Aqua Dots recall) By Karey Wutkowski and Julie Vorman WASHINGTON Nov 7 About 4.2 million Chinese-made Aqua Dots toys were recalled for possibly containing a "date rape" drug, U.S. safety officials said on Wednesday after earlier announcing another batch of toy recalls for unacceptably high levels of lead. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said the Aqua Dots craft toys include a chemical, 1,4 butanediol, on their beads which, if swallowed, can turn toxic and cause unconsciousness, respiratory depression, or seizures. The Aqua Dots toys made Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N) list of top 12 Christmas toys and have been sold at major U.S. retail stores since April for between $17 and $30. Australian officials issued a nation-wide ban on a similar toy after three children were hospitalized. Also on Wednesday, the CPSC issued recalls for about 403,000 toys with paint containing excessive levels of lead, including 380,000 toy cars sold at Dollar General stores. Other warnings were for Dizzy Ducks music boxes, Winnie-the-Pooh spinning tops, "Big Red" wagons, Dragster and Funny Car toys, and Duck Family collectible wind-up toys, all because of paint with unsafe levels of lead. Recalls involving millions of mostly Chinese-made toys, the majority over lead in their paint, have alarmed American consumers in recent months. Lead is toxic and can pose serious health risks to children, including brain damage. No injuries were reported in Wednesday's lead-related recalls but a CPSC spokesman said the agency had two reports of American children who swallowed the Aqua Dots beads and became unconscious. It urged consumers to take away the Aqua Dots toys from their children and look for any stray beads that may have fallen out of the craft kits. The toy is distributed in North America by Spin Master, Ltd a Toronto company, which said it had recalled Aqua Dots from Canadian retail stores as well.

French transportation strike spreads to civil servants
French commuters have been hard-hit by the transport strikes Strike action spreads Hundreds of thousands of civil servants have joined striking transport and energy workers as France is paralysed by a second week of industrial action. Teachers, postal workers, air traffic controllers and hospital staff are holding a 24-hour stoppage over planned job cuts and higher wage demands. Students are continuing to demonstrate over university funding plans. Many thousands joined street protests in Paris, Rouen, Strasbourg, Marseille, Grenoble, Lyon and other cities. It could end up as the biggest show of defiance at President Nicolas Sarkozy's reform plans since his election in May. The latest nationwide stoppage left many schools closed, hospitals providing a reduced service and newsagents without newspapers. I think they have the right to go on strike Paris commuter Strike fever hits France France's workplace anger Are you affected? French energy workers, who began a third 24-hour strike on Monday night, have cut nearly 9% of capacity at nuclear plants, union officials said. Half of the country's high-speed TGV trains were operating on Tuesday, while in Paris only one metro train in three was in service and less than half of buses were expected to run. State rail operator SNCF, which is due to hold talks with transport unions on Wednesday, says the number of its workers on strike had fallen since last week. STRIKERS' GRIEVANCES Teachers, civil servants oppose job cuts and want more pay Newspaper distributors angry at planned restructuring Transport workers on strike for a week over pension reforms Students protest at changes they say could exclude poor In pictures: Strikes spread But with traffic gridlock on the capital's roads on Tuesday morning, the stoppage still caused havoc for commuters.

Sabotage strikes French railways
Cables were blackened by apparent acts of arson on the railway It said acts of sabotage overnight, including fires, caused huge delays to TGV services already hit by a transport union strike in its eighth day. President Nicolas Sarkozy said culprits would be severely punished. Union leaders also condemned the attacks. The sabotage came as three-way talks opened in a bid to end the strike. Managers from SNCF and the Paris metro operator RATP were meeting unions and government representatives to try to reach a compromise on reforms to transport workers' pensions. The government has vowed not to back down on its core proposals. Fires In a statement, the SNCF said there had been "several acts" occurring "at the same time" on lines running north, west, east and south-east out of Paris.

Middle East peace conference begins in Annapolis, Maryland
“We meet to lay the foundation for the establishment of a new nation: a democratic Palestinian state that will live side by side with Israel in peace and security,” Mr. Bush told the gathering of officials from 49 countries at the United States Naval Academy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Flanked by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, Mr. Bush cast peace between Israelis and Palestinians as part of a broader struggle against extremism in the Middle East. It was a moment of diplomatic theater, endorsed by the attendance of a member of the Saudi royal family and orchestrated by Mr. Bush, who pledged that the United States would “monitor and judge the fulfillment of the commitment of both sides.” The agreement, cast as a “joint understanding” between the Israelis and the Palestinians, fell short of the detailed five-page document that Palestinian officials have been pushing. But it went somewhat further than the Israelis had wanted, calling for an immediate start to wide-ranging talks aimed at reaching a final peace accord within 13 months. “We agree to immediately launch good-faith bilateral negotiations in order to conclude a peace treaty, resolving all outstanding issues, including all core issues without exception, as specified in previous agreements,” the joint understanding said. “We agree to engage in vigorous, ongoing and continuous negotiations, and shall make every effort to conclude an agreement before the end of 2008.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was not clear until Mr. Bush, Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas stepped onto the podium in the ornate frescoed Memorial Hall at the Naval Academy, near a replica battle flag from the War of 1812 declaring “Don’t Give Up the Ship,” whether the Israelis and the Palestinians had agreed on anything at all. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even this morning, Mr. Bush held last-minute talks with Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas, while outside the room, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice buttonholed her Israeli and Palestinian counterparts, Tzipi Livni and Abu Alaa, to wring agreement on the wording of the accord. In making the announcement, Mr. Bush read aloud the joint understanding wearing his glasses, suggesting there had not been enough time to convert the just-agreed document to large type for his speech. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Abbas shook hands with Mr. Olmert and Mr. Bush and then pointedly and emotionally put all of the most divisive issues squarely at the center of the talks that are scheduled to begin on Dec. 12. “I am not making an overstatement, Mr. President, if I say that our region stands at a crossroad that separates two historical phases: pre-Annapolis phase and post-Annapolis phase,” Mr. Abbas said. We are prepared to make a painful compromise, rife with risks, in order to realize these aspirations,” he said.

Second night of rioting in Paris suburb, Villiers-le-Bel
Rioting youths blamed the French police for the teenagers' deaths Youths target police The police say some officers suffered bullet wounds, while others were hurt by stones, fireworks and petrol bombs thrown at them in Villiers-le-Bel. The youths said they were avenging the two teenagers killed when their motorcycle hit a police car on Sunday. A senior union official said the riots had been more intense than in 2005. The 2005 unrest, sparked by the accidental deaths of two youths, spread from a nearby suburb of Paris to other cities and continued for three weeks, during which more than 10,000 cars were set ablaze and 300 buildings firebombed. 'Fired upon' The second consecutive night of rioting began early in the evening in Villiers-le-Bel, the northern suburb that saw most of the violence on Sunday. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to keep at bay gangs of youths who were attacking them with stones, fireworks and petrol bombs. Our colleagues will not allow themselves to be fired upon indefinitely without responding Patrice Ribeiro Secretary, Synergie police union Paris riots replayed Have your say More than 70 vehicles and buildings, including the municipal library, two schools and several shops, were set on fire. The national secretary of the Synergie police union, Patrice Ribeiro, said at least 77 officers had been injured in the violence and that several had been wounded by shotgun pellets fired at them. The French Interior Minister, Michele Alliot-Marie, said six police officers had been injured seriously and that they included those who had been "struck in the face and close to the eyes". Mr Ribeiro said police were facing a situation that was "far worse than that of 2005", which began in the nearby suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois. "Our colleagues will not allow themselves to be fired upon indefinitely without responding," he told the radio station, RTL.

REUTERS/Jim Young ANNAPOLIS, Maryland U.S. President George W. Bush has set himself the Herculean task of shepherding an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal by the end of next year, but doubts remain about his commitment. As Bush proudly beamed behind them, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas shook hands on Tuesday over an agreement to immediately begin their first formal peace negotiations in seven years. Their goal is to craft a peace treaty by the end of 2008 -- just before the U.S. president leaves office -- but analysts remain skeptical the two politically weakened leaders can cut a deal and that Bush will seriously push them to do so. The question is whether they have the will and the skill," Aaron David Miller, a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center think tank in Washington and a former U.S. peace mediator, said of the Bush administration. "I am not persuaded yet that they have grasped the seriousness and the amount of work that is required to do what they say they want to do -- to reach an agreement on the core issues by the end of the Bush administration," he added. Talks on those issues -- borders, settlements, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees -- are to begin December 12 and any agreement would require compromises that will be painful for both sides. "There is, I think, considerable doubt remaining about whether the administration is prepared to take on the heavy lifting ... to make this work," said Bruce Riedel, an analyst at the Brookings Institution. In his speech at Annapolis, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal raised some doubt about U.S. determination, noting Washington had committed to try to settle the conflict "within a specific time frame and we shall hold them to that."

Sudanese protesters demand death for British teacher
KHARTOUM, Sudan -- Two British parliament members met officials in Sudan Saturday to try to secure the release of a British teacher imprisoned for naming a teddy bear Muhammad and later said the Khartoum government wants to resolve the case. Britain's Channel 4 News quoted the teacher, Gillian Gibbons, as saying in a statement from police custody that she was being treated well. I'm well," Channel 4 quoted Gibbons as saying. "I want people to know I've been well treated, and especially that I'm well fed. I've been given so many apples I feel I could set up my own stall. "The Sudanese people in general have been pleasant and very generous, and I've had nothing but good experiences during my four months here. I'm really sad to leave, and if I could go back to work tomorrow then I would." Fiona Long, a Channel 4 News spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that the program stood by the accuracy of its report. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi and Lord Nazir Ahmed, both Muslim members of Parliament's upper house, had earlier visited Gibbons in prison for more than an hour. "Gillian was surprisingly in good spirits considering the last seven days," Warsi, a Conservative, told Sky News. Warsi and Ahmed arrived in Sudan Saturday on what the British Foreign Office called a private visit to meet with officials and seek the early release of Gibbons.

Chinese officials say man dies of H5N1 Avian Flu virus
Special report: Global fight against bird flu  NANJING, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- A man in east China's Jiangsu Province died of bird flu on Sunday, the provincial health department reported. The 24-year-old, surnamed Lu, developed fever, chills and other symptoms on Nov. 24. He was hospitalized on Nov. 27 after being diagnosed with "lower left lobe pneumonia" and his condition further deteriorated. He was the 17th Chinese to die of avian flu since 2003. A respiratory tract sample from the man that was examined by Jiangsu Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Center on Saturday was H5N1 positive. The term referred to the virus's genetic make-up. Before he developed symptoms, Lu had been staying at home preparing for an exam and eating home-cooked food, according to local sources. He also had no contact with infected or deceased fowl, the health department said. A test conducted by the China Disease Control and Prevention Center on Sunday, however, indicated he was H5N1 positive. In line with the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of avian flu infection as well as the Chinese standard, a bird flu prevention and control expert panel of the Chinese Ministry of Health concluded Lu had been infected with the flu.

Nine who admitted raping 10-year-old released by Australian judge
Sexual abuse has been a noted problem in indigenous communities A judge's decision not to jail nine men guilty of raping a 10-year-old girl in an Aboriginal community has triggered outrage in Australia. The offenders were either placed on probation or given suspended sentences for the 2005 rape in the Aurukun settlement, in northern Queensland. In her ruling, Judge Sarah Bradley told them that the victim "probably agreed to have sex with all of you". A review of sexual abuse sentences in Aboriginal Queensland has been ordered. Sentencing seven of the accused in Cairns in October, Judge Bradley told them that the girl involved was not forced into sex, according to a report in The Australian newspaper. 'No excuse' But Australia's newly-elected Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has spoken out against the ruling, saying he was "appalled" by the verdict after it was revealed in the Australian press on Monday. My attitude is one of zero tolerance," he told reporters in Queensland, his home state. "There is nothing culturally, there is nothing morally, there is nothing socially and there is definitely nothing legally that would ever allow this sort of decision to be made," she said. "I am not prepared to just write this off as an unusual one-off case," she said.

Musharraf lifts emergency rule in Pakistan
Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif waves to his supporters during an election rally in Patoki near Lahore December 16, 2007. REUTERS/Zulfikar Balti BRUSSELS The European Commission welcomed on Monday the lifting of emergency rule in Pakistan but called for all restrictions to be removed ahead of elections. The move by President Pervez Musharraf on Saturday meant it would be possible to send a limited European Union mission of about 50 people to observe the January 8 general election, a spokesman for the EU executive said. "We welcome President Musharraf's lifting of state of emergency and the revoking of the provisional constitutional order," Amadeu Altafaj Tardio told a regular briefing. "It is essential for all restrictions on fundamental rights and freedoms to be lifted in advance of the parliamentary elections," he said. "We thus appeal to the government to take further steps to enhance confidence in the political process." Altafaj underlined it needed to allow a level playing field for all political parties and to ensure complete transparency in the election process. EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner now believed it would be possible to send an election mission to Pakistan, but some points needed to be clarified, he said. Musharraf, a key ally of the West in the battle against Islamist militancy, restored the constitution after more than a month of emergency rule in which he sacked senior judges, locked up lawyers and rounded up thousands of activists. When Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf declared emergency rule six weeks ago, it was a decision fraught with peril – the opposition was threatening mass protests, and he seemed in imminent danger of being overthrown.

Belgian Chamber of Representatives backs interim government
Mr Verhofstadt's team has a backlog of important business Belgium's caretaker Prime Minister, Guy Verhofstadt, won a vote of confidence on Sunday by 97 votes to 46. King Albert appointed him last Thursday for a three-month term. Coalition talks had failed to reconcile party leaders. Belgium's Dutch-speaking Flemish majority and the French-speaking Walloons remain deeply divided over questions of regional autonomy. Mr Verhofstadt, a Dutch-speaking Liberal, has pledged to spend the next three months drafting a new budget, tackling rising prices and preparing reforms to devolve more power to the regions. In March his five-party cabinet will hand power to Yves Leterme's Flemish Christian Democrats - the winners of the 10 June elections. Mr Leterme remains determined to fulfil his election pledge to devolve more power to the regions. Walloon politicians especially dislike Flemish plans to loosen federal control over taxation and social security. Mr Leterme is deputy prime minister and minister for the budget, transport and institutional reform in the 14-member interim government, which includes politicians from the French-speaking community. Mr Verhofstadt's cabinet will remain in office until March The five-party cabinet of caretaker Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt will stay in office for three months. The main political dispute is over greater regional autonomy - a move broadly favoured by the Dutch-speaking Flanders region but opposed by the French-speaking south. His government will stay in office until March to tackle urgent economic issues neglected during the political crisis.

Benazir Bhutto killed in suicide attack
The blast happened by an entrance to a park A PPP spokesman has told the BBC that Ms Bhutto was injured. It is not clear how badly. She had just addressed the rally in the town of Rawalpindi. In October some 130 people were killed in an attack on Ms Bhutto's cavalcade when she returned to the country. Benazir Bhutto on the campaign trail PPP spokesman Farahtullah Babar said Ms Bhutto was only some 50 metres away when the bomb exploded, the Associated Press news agency reports. "She had just crossed the gate when we heard a deafening sound." Mr Babar said that Ms Bhutto was safe, but subsequently PPP party members have said that Ms Bhutto was injured in the blast and taken to hospital. Ms Bhutto returned from self-imposed exile in October after years out of Pakistan where she had faced corruption charges. Her return was the result of a power-sharing agreement with President Musharraf in which he granted an amnesty that covered the court cases she was facing. On the day of her return she led a motor cavalcade through the city of Karachi.

Violent clashes in Kenya kill scores
Government forces are cracking down on protesters in the wake of Thursday's controversial vote. The thousand-odd protesters carried leafy branches – a standard totem of protest in Kenya – and returned to the slum of Kibera after being turned back, peacefully, by police. It is a calm exception to the looting, shooting, and tear gas that have followed Kenya's most closely contested presidential election. It is also a sign that opposition discontent – peaceful or otherwise – over the announced victory of incumbent President Mwai Kibaki shows no sign of stopping. "The international community knows exactly what has happened: Mr. Kibaki lost the election," says opposition presidential candidate Raila Odinga at a Monday press conference. It is important that this crisis be resolved peacefully, and we have urged our supporters around the country ... to resist acts of violence." If the Dec. 27 elections were a test of Kenyan democracy, as analysts said they would be, the past few days show Kenya heading for a failing grade. Charges of rigging from both major parties, violent protests, and a spiral of ethnic violence – some of it prompted by racist cellphone text messages – have killed more than 120 Kenyans around the country. "From an outside perspective, it looks like [this election] happened too fast," says Bradley Austin, an election expert at the International Foundation for Election Systems. And then you add in 2 million additional voters [since the 2002 election], with such a high voter turnout, and you have what you have here."

Study suggests hospitals are not the best place for cardiac arrest treatment
If your heart were to stop suddenly, you'd think a hospital would be the safest place to be. An alarming new study, released today in the New England Journal of Medicine, says that in about a third of cardiac arrest cases nationwide, hospital staffs do not respond quickly enough, which increases the risk of brain damage and death, and may contribute to the deaths of thousands of Americans every year. Watch the full report tonight on "World News with Charles Gibson" at 6:30 p.m. ET Click here to ask one of the authors of this new study a question about hospital heart care. On television a "code blue" is called, and doctors and nurses come running with a defibrillator to shock the heart back to life. But in actuality, hospital staffs often don't move that fast, and the consequences can be chilling. Now compare those statistics to the more than 50 percent of patients who survive heart attacks while in a crowded airport or a casino, where defibrillators are readily available. Delays in hospitals were most common at night and on weekends. Patients in smaller hospitals with fewer than 250 beds, and in units without heart monitors, are in especially grave danger.

Huckabee, Obama win Iowa caucuses
DES MOINES, Iowa (CNN) -- Barack Obama and Mike Huckabee have claimed victories in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses. With all Democratic precincts reporting, Obama had the support of 38 percent of voters, compared to 30 percent for John Edwards and 29 percent for Hillary Clinton. "The numbers tell us this was a debate between change and experience, and change won," said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. Iowa delivered fatal blows to the campaigns of Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware. Both have decided to abandon their White House runs. Bill Richardson, who finished fourth, said his campaign plans to "take the fight to New Hampshire." Clinton and Obama are in a statistical dead heat in New Hampshire, according to the latest CNN/WMUR poll. Watch where millions of dollars and months of campaigning have left candidates » On the GOP side, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whose campaign was languishing six months ago, and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are now tied for first place in New Hampshire, according to the poll, which was released Wednesday. For the winners of both party's caucuses in Iowa, it's an age revolt for Democrats versus a religious revolt for Republicans, Schneider said.

Israeli troops kill 9 in Gaza
Israel is upset with Cairo for allowing more than 2,000 Gazans to return home from the hajj pilgrimage through the Rafah border crossing with Gaza, rather than, as originally agreed, through the Kerem Shalom crossing controlled by Israel. Israel wanted to check the returning pilgrims to see if they were smuggling cash back for Hamas, which runs Gaza, or if some of those returning were wanted militants who had received military training in Lebanon, Syria or Iran. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Regev denied that there was a diplomatic crisis with Egypt, but said, “There is tension.” Egypt is a crucial ally of Israel, he said. “So we want to try to encourage Egypt to do more, but at the same time to ensure that the relationship remains stable,” Mr. Regev said. “Peace with Egypt is fundamental to us. But if Hamas is allowed through a porous border to strengthen itself, build a more formidable military regime and expand the range of its rockets, it’s not in Egypt’s interests, either.” Israel continued its attacks on Palestinian militants in Gaza, especially from Islamic Jihad. In an incursion in southern Gaza, in a village near Khan Yunis, Israeli troops and tanks, backed by helicopter gunships, destroyed a house, killing two brothers, Ahmad and Sami Fayyad, their sister, Asma Fayyad, 24, and their mother, Karima Fayyad, 60.

Pentagon releases video of incident involving Iranian ships in Persian Gulf
Iran says US video was fabricated The US says Iranian boats were being provocative and dangerous The confrontation Iran's Revolutionary Guards say the US navy fabricated evidence that a convoy of its ships was harassed by Iranian speedboats in Gulf waters on Sunday. The US has released grainy footage, apparently showing small boats speeding near the American warships. In an audio recording, an Iranian radio operator appears to say "I am coming at you; you will explode". The Iranian parliamentary speaker has dismissed the affair as being part of a US propaganda campaign against Tehran. "The footage released by the US Navy are file pictures and the audio has been fabricated," Iranian state-run TV quoted a Revolutionary Guards source as saying. US President George W Bush described the incident as "provocative", adding that it was a "dangerous situation" that should not have happened. Warning You will explode Voice on US tape Radio communications The video, said to be shot from the bridge of the USS Hopper in the Strait of Hormuz, appears to show the small boats racing near the wake of the US ships and crossing close to each other. One boat is shown in close-up - a blue speedboat with at least two crew. After spotting the approaching vessels, a Navy crewman can be heard over the radio, warning them they are approaching a coalition warship. "Request you establish communications, identify yourself and state your intentions, over," he says. At the end of the US recording, the screen goes black and the remainder is in audio only.

'Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography' released, $100 million lawsuit in planning stages
The controversial author of a new biography of Tom Cruise is defending his claim that the actor is the de facto “second in command” of the Church of Scientology and says a lengthy church statement rebutting the book supports the charge. Labeled a writer of “outlandish and malicious lies” by Cruise’s publicist, Andrew Morton told TODAY co-host Meredith Vieira in an exclusive interview that he knew that there would be a backlash when he set out to explore the deep ties between Cruise and the church founded by the late science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. “I think this is a fair, evenhanded treatment of Tom Cruise’s life,” said Morton, who’s also written biographies of Princess Diana, Monica Lewinsky and Madonna. “He’s a man who deserves attention.” “Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography” was released in the U.S. Tuesday after publishers in the United Kingdom and elsewhere reportedly passed on it due to concerns about lawsuits. The release was greeted by a 15-page rebuttal issued by the Church of Scientology, of which Cruise is a member, which calls attention to Morton’s background as a British tabloid journalist and states: “His book is a bigoted, defamatory assault replete with lies.” The church took particular exception to Morton’s claim that Cruise, who has been named the most powerful celebrity in the world by Forbes magazine, is effectively the second-in-command of the controversial religion. “Insinuations that Mr. Cruise is second-in-command of the Church are not only false, they are ludicrous,” the church’s statement says. Mr. Cruise is a Scientology parishioner and holds no official or unofficial position in the church hierarchy.” “It’s nonsense for them to say that, because he’s one of the most significant members of the church,” Morton told Vieira. This book is very carefully researched, very carefully vetted.” When Vieira asked who told him that Cruise is effectively second-in-command, Morton said, “People who worked with David Miscavige, the head of the Church of Scientology, people who’ve just left, people who’ve been in executive positions.” Further, he said, it’s unusual for a church to issue a lengthy rebuttal of a book for an ordinary member. Countering Morton’s assertions of accuracy, the church pointed out that the book is not being published in Australia, England and New Zealand because of those countries’ strict libel laws. And in its review, The New York Times wrote that Morton “pushed the limits of responsible reporting.” “Their policy is always to attack the attacker,” Morton said of Scientology, which in his book he calls a cult.

Tom Cruise Scientology promotional video leaked to the Internet
'It's rough and tumble, wild and woolly" and "a blast," according to Tom Cruise. But Scientology also confers some serious bling, none shinier than the Freedom Medal of Valour. The actor and proselytiser for the Church of Scientology was awarded this gold-coloured medallion by the movement in 2004 but an edited video clip of Cruise giving an intense spiel for the award ceremony has only just emerged on YouTube. The gong features two interlocking triangles on their sides with an "S" snaking through and the words "freedom medal" around the top. According to Andrew Morton's new unauthorised biography of Cruise, the actor is the second most powerful person in the organisation. In a statement condemning Morton's book, the Scientologists described him rather more dismissively as "a Scientology parishioner" who "holds no official or unofficial position in the Church hierarchy". He is, however, the only holder of the Freedom Medal of Valour. Cruise's is the same, says Janet Laveau, of the Church of Scientology in Britain, but "the Medal of Valour means the humanitarian work he did reached a larger global population". "It's about rolling up your own personal sleeves and making a very big difference for people who need help," she says.

Australian actor Heath Ledger found dead in New York City
"He was found unconscious at the apartment and pronounced dead," the New York Police Department said, adding that pills were found near the body. Police are reportedly investigating if the Australian actor - nominated for an Oscar for Brokeback Mountain - died of an overdose of prescription pills. Father Kim Ledger said that the death of his 28-year-old "dearly loved son" had been "tragic" and "accidental".

Fred Thompson quits U.S. Presidential race
(CNN) -- Former Sen. Fred Thompson on Tuesday ended his run for the presidency, coming off the heels of a disappointing third-place finish in South Carolina's GOP primary and heading into the showdown state of Florida next week. Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee has dropped out of the race for the GOP presidential nomination. "Today I have withdrawn my candidacy for president of the United States," Thompson said in a statement. "I hope that my country and my party have benefited from our having made this effort. Jeri and I will always be grateful for the encouragement and friendship of so many wonderful people." Thompson entered the race in September, long after his Republican rivals had announced their candidacies and began raising money. His campaigning style was criticized as lackluster, and he was never able to capitalize on the anticipation supporters had built before he announced that he was getting into the race. Thompson was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994 and represented Tennessee for eight years. Short of cash and sinking in national polls, Thompson had staked his hopes on South Carolina, where a strong showing could have reinvigorated his flagging campaign. Watch how Thompson's withdrawal could affect the race » Thompson played to the voters as a staunch conservative and a son of the South.

Italy's PM Prodi faces confidence vote
(Adds 1st vote, opposition, analysis and quotes)  By Stephen Brown  ROME, Jan 23 Italy's centre-left government struggled to stay afloat on Wednesday and even the president appeared to doubt that Prime Minister Romano Prodi, weakened by defections, could survive a confidence vote in the Senate. As expected, Prodi won a first confidence vote in the lower house where he has a clear majority. But with Prodi under pressure to step down before the vote in the upper house due on Thursday, the third biggest economy in the euro zone seemed doomed to prolonged political upheaval that will further delay reforms, just when a global slowdown looms. Ordinary Italians, who have seen 61 governments since World War Two, seemed jaded by the prospect of more turmoil, while in worried markets, the spread between Italian government bonds and German bunds widened to levels not seen for 6-1/2 years. A government source said President Giorgio Napolitano had advised Prodi to "review" the wisdom of facing the Senate, where he has lost his majority. "After today it's 100 percent certain Romano Prodi will resign to avoid being beaten in the Senate," said right-wing National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini. Prodi's once slim Senate majority has been erased by the defection of former justice minister Clemente Mastella's Catholic Udeur and the centrist Liberal Democrats. Losing or drawing the vote would force Prodi to quit but the 68-year-old prime minister fuelled speculation he might resign earlier by visiting Napolitano -- a reminder of his tactical resignation last February meant to scare his allies into line. "MINORITY DICTATORSHIP"  Prodi's fate hangs on whether he can muster enough support in the Senate to compensate for the defections and for two coalition dissidents who have said they will vote 'no'. Without his two-seat Senate majority, he relies entirely on seven unelected lifetime senators to survive. Some calculations show the best he can hope for is to win by one vote. Giulio Andreotti, an ex-prime minister and honorary senator, said he saw "no alternative at the moment to this government, so I will vote for Prodi". But Roberto Maroni, a deputy from the right-wing Northern League, said it would be a "minority dictatorship" if Prodi clung to power on the votes of unelected elder statesmen.

REUTERS/Enrico Oliverio/Italian Presidency Press Office/Handout ROME Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi resigned on Thursday after his centre-left government lost a confidence vote in the Senate, prompting opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi to demand immediate elections. We will say what we want to do in the first 100 days of our government," said conservative former prime minister Berlusconi, who has led Prodi in opinion polls. But President Giorgio Napolitano may first appoint an interim government to reform a messy electoral system, which in 2006 landed Prodi with a tiny Senate majority and an unstable nine-party coalition ranging from Catholics to communists. Analysts said the demise of the 61st government since World War Two should not hurt economic growth prospects, as Prodi had been too busy surviving politically to carry out deep reforms, but could threaten a recent improvement in public finances. "This isn't necessarily bad news, it all depends what comes after Prodi," said Unicredit MIB economist Marco Valli. "Markets don't like uncertainty but if what follows Prodi is a stronger government, then that could be positive." Berlusconi's senators opened champagne to celebrate, earning a rebuke from Senate President Franco Marini who said: "Get rid of that bottle, we're not in a pub here." Prodi, 68, was undermined by his own allies, just as when his first spell in office was cut short in 1998.

Indonesia reports 100th human death from bird flu
Jan 29 The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed on Tuesday the deaths of a 23-year-old Indonesian woman and a nine-year-old Indonesian boy from the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. Of the 124 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 100 have been fatal. There have been 223 human deaths globally from the H5N1 strain and 357 confirmed cases of infection since 2003, according to WHO data. Following is a list of confirmed human cases of H5N1.

So far, most human cases can be traced to direct or indirect contact with infected birds. Initial tests usually take a day or two to confirm if someone has H5N1. More detailed testing by government laboratories or those affiliated with the WHO can take a week or more. JAKARTA, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of bird flu casualties in Indonesia has reached 100, following the death of two more patients over the last few days, according to local media on Tuesday. A 9-year-old boy died at a Jakarta hospital on Sunday and was tested positive of having the H5N1 virus, and on the same day a 23-year-old woman from the Jakarta suburb of Bekasi became the 100th victim, Metro TV news reported. In overall, Indonesia has confirmed 124 bird flu cases in human since the virus began ravaging in 2003. Indonesia is the nation worst affected by bird flu and has struggled to contain the virus.

International manhunt for alleged kidney harvester
Indian police have confiscated the passports of two Britons who allegedly travelled to the country to buy kidneys in an organ transplant racket, investigators said today. After raiding a private hospital last week in Gurgaon, an upmarket suburb of Delhi, police found that poor labourers had had their kidneys removed, sometimes against their will, and sold to clients from around the world. Doctors running the illegal operation charged 1.5m rupees (£18,750) for a kidney transplant while the donor was paid about 40,000 rupees. The trade has shocked India, which banned the sale of kidneys for commercial gain in 1994 with jail terms of up to five years for those found guilty. However, the ring is believed to have seen more than 500 organs bought in the past nine years. The police seized computers and are decoding e-mail accounts. Police told the Guardian today that "two British people have not been let out of the country" as part of their investigation". They are helping with our investigation... [There] are allegations that they are part [of the buying ring]," said the deputy commissioner of Gurgaon police, Rakesh Arya. They have been apprehended but not yet charged." The police refused to divulge their names and the British High Commission said it had not been informed of an investigation.

ATHENS, Greece — The leader of Greece’s powerful Orthodox Church, Archbishop Christodoulos, who eased centuries of tension with the Vatican but was viewed as reactionary by his liberal critics, died Monday. Christodoulos, who headed the church for a decade, was first hospitalized in Athens in June before being diagnosed with cancer of the liver and large intestine. He spent 10 weeks in a hospital in Miami but an October liver transplant operation was canceled when doctors discovered the cancer had spread. He refused hospital treatment in the final weeks of his life. He died at his home in the Athens suburb of Psyhico, church officials said. The Interior Ministry announced four days of national mourning and said Christodoulos would be buried on Thursday with full state honors. Across the country flags flew at half-staff, including atop the ancient Acropolis and on the parliament building. The archbishop’s flag-draped coffin was taken to the cathedral in Athens, where his body will lie in state until his funeral. Christodoulos was elected church leader in 1998 and is credited with reinvigorating the vast institution that represents 97 percent of Greece’s native born population. Christodoulos helped create church Web sites and radio stations, and frequently issued detailed checklists on how black-clad Orthodox priests should conduct themselves in public.

High level al-Qaeda leader reported dead
Libi is thought to have directed recent suicide attacks News of his death emerged on a website used by Islamist groups. Ekhlaas.org said he had "fallen as a martyr". Pakistan says it cannot confirm reports that Libi was killed by a US missile strike in Pakistan on Tuesday Libi is believed to have behind an attack at an Afghan air base last year while the US vice-president was there. Most analysts say Libi's death would be a blow to al-Qaeda, both symbolically and operationally. But the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says al-Qaeda has proved itself to be resilient to individual losses and setbacks, and no-one is predicting an immediate decline in attacks in the region. US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he did not "have anything definitive" to say about the news, the Associated Press reported. Al-Qaeda spokesman Libi, 41, has appeared in a number of al-Qaeda videos. ABU LAITH AL-LIBI Born: Libya, around 1967 Description: 193cm (6'4") tall, solid build, dark hair and eyes, scars on back Role: Senior operations commander; al-Qaeda spokesman Source: Globalsecurity.org  Profile: Abu Laith al-Libi He has acted as a spokesman for the group, announcing in 2002 that Osama Bin Laden and Taleban leader Mullah Omar had survived the US invasion of Afghanistan. Libi was under US intelligence surveillance and most details about him are classified, our correspondent says. "This individual is in the top half-dozen figures in al-Qaeda... who has a long record of military activity on behalf of al-Qaeda," an unnamed Western official told Reuters news agency. He is thought to be one of al-Qaeda's most senior field commanders in Afghanistan, and to have directed a number of recent suicide bomb attacks in the east of the country. The US has linked him the bombing at the US base at Bagram in Afghanistan in February last year that killed 23 people.

75 million left without Internet access after fault in undersea cable
The first cut caused widespread disruption to net services The Falcon cable, owned by a firm which operates another damaged cable, led to a "critical" telecom breakdown, according to one local official. The cause of the latest break has not been confirmed but a repair ship has been deployed, said owner Flag Telecom. The earlier break disrupted service in Egypt, the Middle East and India. "The situation is critical for us in terms of congestion," Omar Sultan, chief executive of Dubai's ISP DU, told The Associated Press, following the most recent break. Wednesday's incident caused disruption to 70% of the nationwide internet network in Egypt on Wednesday, while India suffered up to 60% disruption. Flag Telecom said a repair ship was expected to arrive at the site of the first break - 8.3km from Alexandria in Egypt - on 5 February, with repair work expected to take a week. A repair ship deployed to the second break - 56km from Dubai - was expected to arrive at the site in the "next few days", the firm said. Web returns The first cable - the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) - was cut at 0800 on 30 January, the firm said. FLAG is a 28,000km (17,400 mile) long submarine communications cable that links Australia and Japan with Europe via India and the Middle East. SEA-ME-WE 4 is a submarine cable linking South East Asia to Europe via the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East. The two cable cuts meant that the only cable in service connecting Europe to the Middle East via Egypt was the older Sea-M-We 3 system, according to research firm TeleGeography.

US presidential candidates gearing up for Super Tuesday
With 72 hours to go before Super Tuesday, and with some two dozen states at play, the candidates are hop-scotching the country this weekend, trying to scoop up delegates like pebbles. Ensconced in delegate rich California this weekend, Sen. Hillary Clinton seems to be sending a message to voters torn between her and Sen. Barack Obama, suggesting maybe she'd make him her running mate. "Seeing the two of us was just so exciting for so many people," Clinton told PBS host Tavis Smiley in an interview after the two debated Thursday night. With delegates allotted proportionally, a candidate doesn't have to win the state to walk out closer to the nomination. "The president made a deal with Sen. Kennedy and neither one of them meant to mess it up," the former president said, referring to Kennedy's support for President Bush's No Child Left Behind education plan. Clinton's fellow Arkansan Mike Huckabee is staying south for the Republican race -- trying to prevent his fellow evangelicals from flocking to rival Mitt Romney. Sen. John McCain is also down south today in Nashville, trying to build on momentum from big endorsements and his Florida win before he heads to Massachusetts, the home state of Mitt Romney. Romney is sinking more of his millions into TV ads in Super Tuesday states, but for the first time he hinted he needs to get a serious return on his investment Tuesday to keep going.

Rugby union: Wales, France, England win in second week of 2008 Six Nations
By Sean Davies Williams' second try was highly controversial Wales (10) 30 Tries: S Williams 2, Hook Cons: Hook 2, S Jones Pens: Hook, S Jones 2 Scotland (6) 15 Pens: Paterson 5 A spectacular brace of Shane Williams tries saw Wales maintain their 100% start to the RBS Six Nations. The home side dominated possession and territory and their flair saw first half tries for Williams and James Hook. But dogged Scotland held on through the boot of Chris Paterson, the wing landing all five of his goal kicks. Highlights: Wales 30-15 Scotland Interview: Man of the match Martyn Williams Interview: Wales coach Warren Gatland Interview: Scotland coach Frank Hadden Wales began with the momentum of last week's stunning win over England, man-of-the-match Martyn Williams and Hook pouncing on a loose Scotland line-out to win their side a scrum five metres from the visitors' line. 606: DEBATE Martyn Williams remains the scavenger supreme BBC Sport's Bruce Pope Scotland's defence proved stout through a series of Welsh drives, and they escaped with a penalty when Tom Shanklin held the ball on the floor. The Welsh were looking to spread the ball in front of a record crowd at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, but Hook spun a midfield pass into the arms of Andrew Henderson. Paterson hacked forward to the Wales line, securing the position from which the wing - restored to Frank Hadden's team this week after the miserable loss to France - opened the scoring with a 10th-minute penalty. It's 100% certain that I scored, there's no doubt in my mind Shane Williams More Wales reaction The ball was spun left, Hook putting Lee Byrne into space with a delightful pass after Gavin Henson helped straighten the line. Byrne's pass went behind Williams, but the winger gathered and threw a trademark side-step to cross for the opening try, converted by Hook. The 14 men held out, Hook and Paterson exchanging penalties after his return to leave Scotland relieved with a scoreline of 10-6 at the break.

International row after Spielberg quits 2008 Beijing Olympics
'A call for a boycott doesn't serve any purpose and it would be a great pity' Boycotting the Olympics would not help the human rights situation in Darfur, the Olympics minister Tessa Jowell said today. She said that although aspects of Chinese policy were "wholly unacceptable", a boycott was not the right way to exert pressure on Beijing. Jowell was speaking in response to calls from Sudanese rebels for the international community to boycott the Olympics because of China's support for the Sudanese government and its role in Darfur. "The world has known for the last seven years that Beijing would host the Olympics," Jowell told the Times. "Most progressive governments accept that there are wholly unacceptable aspects of Chinese policy, but that did not stop the International Olympic Committee awarding them the games. "A call for a boycott doesn't serve any purpose and it would be a great pity. This doesn't mean, however, we should be distracted from the urgency of Darfur." Mr Spielberg's decision is a high-profile blow to Olympic organisers The foreign ministry said "ulterior motives" may be behind criticism of its links with Sudan. China has strong economic and military ties with Sudan, which campaigners say it should use to put pressure on Khartoum to resolve the Darfur crisis. "It is understandable if some people do not understand the Chinese government policy on Darfur, but I am afraid that some people may have ulterior motives, and this we cannot accept," he told a news conference.

Six dead in campus shooting at Northern Illinois University
NIU campus gathers to commemorate 1 year since fatal rampage Victims are mourned and community aims to move forward in victims' honor On Saturday, the sophomore returned to the center, joining another crowd to pay tribute to the victims once again. But this time, the mood was different, as the university also celebrated its triumph of recovery. Alyssa Everley was among thousands of students who gathered solemnly at Northern Illinois University's Convocation Center last February for a memorial service honoring five victims slain in a bloody rampage. "Last year it was shock and pain," Everley said. "Now we still want to pay respect to the victims, but we also realize the best way to honor them is by moving forward." Twelve months have passed since a suicidal gunman, Steven Kazmierczak, shot 25 students in an NIU lecture hall, leaving the campus plagued with confusion, anger and sadness. On the first anniversary, the university spent sun-up to sundown honoring the victims, while heralding the compassion and courage demonstrated on the campus. "This is a celebration of character," proclaimed NIU President John Peters, speaking at the morning kick-off ceremony, which honored first responders who arrived on the scene of the shootings, the volunteers who poured onto campus and those who donated cash, quilts and other support to the university. "A year ago, a year ago in this very place, we pledged to not let a single act of violence define us," Peters said. Peters led a ceremonial procession to the site that included the families of the victims and Gov.

Bush decided to have the Navy shoot the 5,000-pound (2,270 kg) minivan-sized satellite with a modified tactical missile, after security advisers suggested its reentry could lead to a loss of life. U.S. officials said they were not trying to protect classified information on the satellite or to demonstrate their capabilities to China, which downed one of its own satellites with a missile last year, drawing criticism from Washington. But some experts disagreed and questioned the risks associated with shooting down the satellite. Two defense officials also cited disagreement within the administration over the action and said the decision appears to have been strongly influenced by the White House. Officials would not estimate the likelihood of success, only calling it high. Thousands of space objects fall to Earth each year, but they generally scatter over a huge area and there have never been any reported injuries. What makes this different is the likelihood that the satellite could release much of the more than 1,000 pounds (454 kg) of hydrazine fuel as a toxic gas, according to James Jeffries, deputy national security adviser. He said the satellite was unlikely to hit a populated area and described the danger from toxic gas as limited. But Jeffries added: "There was enough of a risk for the president to be quite concerned about human life." Jeffries and other U.S. officials rejected suggestions that Bush opted to shoot down the satellite out of concern that classified material on board could survive reentry into Earth's atmosphere, and potentially land in the wrong hands.

Kosovo declares independence from Serbia
Albanian and American flags have been on prominent display Declaration Kosovo's parliament has unanimously endorsed a declaration of independence from Serbia, in a historic session. Celebrations went on into the night after Prime Minister Hashim Thaci promised a democracy that respected the rights of all ethnic communities. Serbia's PM denounced the US for helping create a "false state". A split later emerged at the Security Council, when Russia said there was no basis for changing a 1999 resolution which handed Kosovo to the UN. Tens of thousands of people had thronged the streets of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, since the morning. We have waited for this day for a very long time... from today, we are proud, independent and free Hashim Thaci Kosovo Prime Minister Kosovo's 'dream come true' Mark Mardell's Euroblog Serb and Albanian views Crowds surrounded an independence monument which was unveiled during the evening and signed by Mr Thaci and Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu.

Several Serbian ministers had travelled to Kosovo to show their support for the ethnic Serbian minority.

Magnitude 7.5 earthquake strikes Aceh
The tremor, whose epicentre was near the island of Simeulue, 319km (198 miles) off the coast of Sumatra, also damaged many buildings, they added. The epicentre was close to that of the earthquake which triggered the 2004 Asian tsunami, killing 200,000 people. Tsunami warning centres initially issued alerts, but later lifted them. Indonesia lies on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, one of the most seismically active regions of the world. 'Mass panic' Local residents said Wednesday's earthquake, which hit Simeulue at 1508 (0808 GMT) according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), lasted for almost a minute. It was felt strongly more than 300km (185 miles) away in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, where people left their offices after buildings started shaking. Everything shook very strongly for more than a minute and I ran along with the others Ahmad Yushadi "Everything shook very strongly for more than a minute and I ran along with the others. I heard people screaming in panic," Ahmad Yushadi told the Associated Press news agency. An official from the Indonesian ministry of health, Rustam Pakaya, said the authorities on Simeulue had reported three deaths and 25 serious injuries caused by the earthquake. "People have evacuated to the mountains," he said.

Belgrade: demonstration against independent Kosovo escalates into riots
A charred body has been discovered inside a torched office at the U.S. Embassy in Serbia's capital Belgrade, embassy officials said Thursday, just hours after several hundred demonstrators attacked the compound. The swarm of rioters had broken away from a massive rally held earlier in the day to protest against Washington's recognition of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The U.S. Embassy in Belgrade burns after masked attackers broke into the building and set an office on fire. ((Associated Press)) Flames and smoke billowed out of an office on the embassy grounds around 7 p.m. local time after crowds of masked young men broke into the compound and used metal bars to smash into the first floor of the building. A few demonstrators climbed the building and set the U.S. flag on fire as others used a door to ram the metal-barred windows. "Our embassy was attacked by thugs," White House press secretary Dana Perino said while travelling from Africa with reporters and U.S. officials on Air Force One. "We have made known to the Serbian government our concern and displeasure that their police force did not prevent this incident." Embassy spokesman William Wenland said all embassy staffers were accounted for, and noted the person who died was likely a protester. "It appeared to have been a protester who was caught in the fire that had been set by the protesters and not as a result of any interaction with U.S. security forces," Wenland said. Dozens of heavily armed police patrolled the area soon after, while riot police used shields and tear gas to push back the mostly male demonstrators, who then fled into side streets and continued to clash with security forces. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S. ambassador to Serbia was staying safe at his home and was in contact with U.S. officials as the clashes were ongoing. Security officials and marine guards were in a different part of the compound, but no embassy staff were inside the attacked building, McCormack told reporters Thursday afternoon in Washington.

Pieces of white fuselage and other remains from the crash littered the area, images from a video shot by searchers showed. Whipped by cross-winds, rescue mountain-climbers struggled to lower themselves down the cliff to reach the plane operated by the small local airline Santa Barbara, civil defense chief Antonio Rivero said. "This plane was found completely wrecked, smashed against the face of one of the mountains," Rivero said. The plane crashed 6 miles from the tourist city of Merida after taking off for the capital Caracas on Thursday before dusk in a notoriously difficult region to navigate.

Prince Harry ordered to return home
British media agreed not to report the prince's deployment The 23-year-old royal, who has spent the last 10 weeks serving in Helmand Province, is flying back to the UK amid concerns for his safety. The move follows the collapse of a news blackout deal over his tour of duty, which was broken by foreign media. There had been fears the prince, who is third in line to the throne, could become a target for the Taleban. In a statement, the Ministry of Defence described the reporting of Harry's deployment by foreign media as "regrettable" but said that contingency plans for such a leak were in place. Prince Harry, in an interview recorded in Afghanistan prior to his withdrawal, said he had enjoyed being away from the press and England. "I don't want to sit around Windsor, because I generally don't like England that much and it's nice to be away from all the press and the papers.....," he said. More recently he took part in a major operation to disrupt Taleban lines of communication Brigadier Andrew Mackay It added that while the prince should have returned "in a matter of weeks" with his Household Cavalry regiment battlegroup, the situation had now "clearly changed". He continued: "He has seen service both in the south of Helmand and in the north. "This decision has been taken primarily on the basis that the worldwide media coverage of Prince Harry in Afghanistan could impact on the security of those who are deployed there, as well as the risks to him as an individual soldier," it added. Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid tribute to the prince and said Britain owed him a "debt of gratitude" for his service in Afghanistan, but he added that it was correct to bring Harry back to the UK.

Mystery surrounds ricin discovery in Las Vegas hotel
LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Officers who found the deadly poison ricin in a Las Vegas, Nevada, extended-stay hotel room also discovered firearms and an "anarchist-type textbook" with an entry about ricin bookmarked, police said Friday. The deadly poison ricin and an "anarchist-type textbook" were found in a room in this Las Vegas hotel. Two tests had confirmed the substance found was ricin, and that a man who was staying there has been hospitalized for more than two weeks and is in critical condition, police said Friday. The 57-year-old man, whose name was not released, summoned authorities February 14 and asked to be transported to a hospital because of difficulty breathing, Kathy Suey, deputy chief of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters. But police were not aware of the ricin's existence until Thursday, when a second man, who identified himself as a relative of the victim, went to the Extended Stay America room to clear the victim's possessions out and found the substance. That man brought the poison, which was in vials in a plastic bag, to the manager's office, and police were notified. "He brought it to the management and said that 'I'm not comfortable with whatever this item is.'" Watch how ricin can be used to kill » Lombardo said police first were called to the room on Tuesday after weapons were discovered there. He said officers discovered "general firearms," which have been impounded, and an "anarchist-type textbook" marked at an entry on ricin.

Armenian President Kocharyan declares state of emergency
(CNN) -- Armenian President Robert Kocharian declared a state of emergency Saturday night after a day of clashes between police and protesters, a spokeswoman for the Armenian Foreign Ministry said. The state of emergency will "hopefully bring some order" to the capital, Yerevan, said Salpi Ghazarian, assistant to the Armenian foreign minister, who spoke to CNN early Sunday. The state of emergency could last until March 20, she said, but the government hopes "that it will be lifted sooner." The clashes began when authorities used force to clear Freedom Square of thousands of demonstrators who had camped there for the past 10 days, according to a U.S. Embassy official. Ghazarian said the authorities "moved in" because "they thought that there were arms there, and it turned out that they were right." Watch a report on clashes between police and the opposition » The embassy official estimated that the demonstrations in Freedom Square grew to as many as 60,000 Armenians at times over the last 10 days. Watch Ghazarian discuss the situation in Armenia » "What is happening on the streets of Yerevan is people protesting what they consider to be unfair elections," Ghazarian said. There are a couple of burning cars, and there are a few hurt people," she said. Witnesses told CNN that Saturday morning's action by Armenian riot police was bloody, but the U.S. official said there were no confirmed deaths or serious injuries.

Small explosion investigated in Times Square, New York
Authorities on Friday were investigating whether an explosion at the Times Square military recruiting office was connected to strikingly similar bombings at two foreign consulates in New York, but ruled out a link to mysterious letters sent to Capitol Hill offices. Investigators were also scrutinizing surveillance video and forensic evidence after a bicycle-riding bomber struck the landmark station Thursday, scarring one of the world's most recognizable locations. Authorities said there was no connection between the blast and a letter sent to as many as 100 members of Congress bearing the words "Happy New Year, We Did It." The lengthy anti-war letters — which arrived with photos of a man standing in front of the recruiting office before it was damaged — contained no threats, officials said. Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles, said an individual was questioned there about the letters to Congress and "there is no evidence linking the letters, which contained no threat, to the bombing." A law enforcement official in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation of the bombing is continuing, called the timing of the letters an "incredibly unbelievable coincidence" and said no charges were expected in connection with them. Democratic lawmakers were startled to receive the letters in their office mail just hours after the early morning New York bombing, and turned them over to the Capitol Police. One law enforcer said the "We did it" referred to the Democratic wins. Law enforcement officials speculated the letters may have been sent to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the start of the Iraq war, which is March 19. And the "We did it" claim may simply be sarcasm connected to the war, one official said. Each envelope was stamped with two $1 stamps and contained a white label with a return address, which the police did not identify in the e-mail.

REUTERS/Sea Shepherd Conservation Society/Handout SYDNEY A hardline anti-whaling activist, Sea Shepherd captain Paul Watson, said he was shot during a clash with Japanese whalers in the Southern Ocean on Friday, but survived because he was wearing a kevlar vest. But Japan's fisheries agency said coastguard officials aboard the whaling ship had only thrown "flash grenades", which are used for crowd control and are not regarded as weapons. Watson told Australian radio from his ship that anti-whaling activists threw "stink bombs" on to the Japanese whaling factory ship the Nisshin Maru. The Japanese retaliated throwing "flash grenades" on to the deck of the Steve Irwin and during the clash, Watson said he was shot. Sea Shepherd posted photos on its news Web site showing Japanese throwing smoking canisters and Watson holding what he said was a bullet and a dented badge hit by the object. "I didn't see anyone shoot at me and it was pretty hard for any of the crew to see anything because everyone was ducking from these flash grenades," said Watson. Australia's foreign affairs department initially said it had been told by Japan that warning shots had been fired, but later clarified its statement saying Japanese whalers fired three "warning balls", also known as "flashbangs". "He must have heard the bang of the flash grenade and got a shock," the fisheries ministry official said.

China kills suspected terrorists, prevents 'air disaster'
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The terrorists killed and captured more than a month ago in the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region had planned an attack targeting the Beijing Olympic Games, a senior official said here on Sunday. Knives, axes, grenades and books about terrorism were seized. "Obviously, the gang had planned an attack targeting the Olympics," said Wang Lequan, chief of the Xinjiang autonomous regional committee of the Communist Party of China on the sidelines of the national parliamentary session. The group was said to have collaborated with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a group the United Nations labeled a terrorist organization in 2002. "The Olympic Games slated for this August is a big event, but there are always a few people who conspire sabotages. It is no longer a secret now," said Wang. "Those terrorists, saboteurs and secessionists are to be battered resolutely, no matter what ethnic group they are from," said the official, adding that such evil forces usually attempt to deceive the world under the name of ethnic and religious causes. Wang vowed to adopt a strike-first policy against the "three evil forces" of terrorists, separatists and extremists, saying "we are prepared to strike whenever their conspiracies are detected." Xinjiang police crushed a terrorist training camp in January 2007, in which 18 terrorists were killed and 17 others captured. The attackers were stopped in time, and all the passengers and crew members on board were safe, according to Nur Bekri, chairman of the autonomous regional government, who added that further investigation is still going on. BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China on Friday foiled a planned attack on a passenger plane taking off from Urumqi, capital of the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, an official said here on Sunday.

Gay Iranian awaits decision on asylum
LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain says it will reconsider the asylum application of a gay Iranian teenager who claims he will be persecuted if he is returned home. Mehdi Kazemi believes he will face persecution if he is made to return to Iran. Friday's announcement came after the European Parliament urged a resolution to the case and said that Iran routinely detained, tortured and executed homosexuals. He fled to the Netherlands and sought asylum there -- but the government turned him down, saying the case should be dealt with in Britain, where he first applied. "Following representations made on behalf of Mehdi Kazemi, and in the light of new circumstances since the original decision was made, I have decided that Mr. Kazemi's case should be reconsidered on his return to the UK from the Netherlands," British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said in a statement. » Kazemi was studying in Britain in 2006 when he learned that his partner in Iran had been arrested, charged with sodomy, and hanged, according to Kazemi's uncle -- who spoke to CNN on condition that his name not be revealed because of safety concerns. "Under torture and pressure, (the partner) revealed Mehdi's name as his boyfriend," the uncle said.

China: Dalai Lama's comments are 'downright nonsense'
Special report: Dalai's separatist activities condemned BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- High-ranking Tibetan officials refuted Dalai Lama's "cultural genocide" and "terror rule" remarks on Sunday and said such arguments were a tale of a tub and "downright nonsense." Dalai cited the "rule of terror" and "cultural genocide" in its latest separatist remarks after the Lhasa riot, according to media reports. "Should the Dalai separatists group not spoil (the stability in Tibet), Tibet would be in its best period of development in history," said Lhasa Mayor Doje Cezhug. "Nowadays, Tibetan people have been living a modern life while enjoying the development of traditional Tibetan culture." Legqog, director of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan Regional People's Congress, said that "'the rule of terror in Tibet', as Dalai claimed, was downright nonsense." "The concept of 'citizen' didn't even exist in the old Tibet," he said. They suffered all kinds of excruciating tortures." "The Tibetan people only started to manage their own affairs after the regional autonomy was inaugurated in 1965," Legqog said. The Party and government has attached great importance to the cultural development of Tibet and have carried out a large scale of survey, salvage and protection for Tibet's cultural relics, said Qiangba Puncog, Tibet Autonomous Regional Government chairman.

Visionary and author Arthur C. Clarke dead at age 90
Sir Arthur C Clarke was famous for his science fiction writing The Somerset-born author achieved his greatest fame in 1968 when his short story The Sentinel was turned into the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. His visions of space travel and computing sparked the imagination of readers and scientists alike. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse paid tribute, hailing the writer as a "great visionary". Since 1995, the author had been largely confined to a wheelchair by post-polio syndrome. He died at 0130 local time (2000 GMT) of respiratory complications and heart failure, according to his aide, Rohan De Silva. Far-seeing scientist "Sir Arthur has left written instructions that his funeral be strictly secular," his secretary, Nalaka Gunawardene, was quoted as saying by news agency AFP. He served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, and foresaw the concept of communication satellites. When asked why he never patented his idea for communication satellites, he said: "I did not get a patent because I never thought it will happen in my lifetime." In the 1940s, he maintained man would reach the moon by the year 2000, an idea dismissed at the time. He was the author of more than 100 fiction and non-fiction books, and his writings are credited by many observers with giving science fiction a human and practical face.

McCanns granted newspaper apologies
The McCanns received a public apology read in open court McCann spokesman Madeleine McCann's parents have welcomed a libel settlement and apology from Express Newspapers for suggesting they were responsible for her death. In a statement the McCanns said they were pleased that the newspaper group had admitted the "utter falsity" of the "grotesque" stories written about them. The newspaper group has paid £550,000 to the Find Madeleine campaign. The Daily Express and Daily Star have issued front-page apologies admitting the stories were inaccurate. Under review The papers said: "We acknowledge that there is no evidence whatsoever to support this theory and that Kate and Gerry are completely innocent of any involvement in their daughter's disappearance.

Their solicitor, Adam Tudor, from media law specialists Carter-Ruck, said: "These are matters that are being kept under review." The couple reportedly hope the libel action against Express Newspapers will serve as a deterrent, but reserve the right to take action in the future. But in a statement, they said: "We embarked on this course of action reluctantly, indeed with a heavy heart, as we did not wish the pursuit of it to become a distraction from our sole aim - finding Madeleine." They called on Portuguese police investigating her disappearance to end their status as suspects [in Portuguese, arguidos]: "We hope that the Portuguese authorities lift our arguido status in the very near future so that everyone can focus on finding our beautiful little girl." The McCanns said: "We are pleased that Express Newspapers have today admitted the utter falsity of the numerous grotesque and grossly defamatory allegations that their titles published about us on a sustained basis over many months. "The exceptional publication of these apologies, together with today's statement of full apology in open court before Mr Justice Eady, was the only just and proper response by Express Newspapers following our complaint."

Major US presidential candidates have passport files breached
State Department employees snooped through the passport files of three presidential candidates — Sens. Barack Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain — and the department's inspector general is investigating. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the violations of McCain and Clinton's passport files were not discovered until Friday, after officials were made aware of the unauthorized access of Obama's records and a separate search was conducted. The incidents raise questions as to whether the information was accessed for political purposes and why two contractors involved in the Obama search were dismissed before investigators had a chance to interview them. It recalled an incident in 1992, when a Republican political appointee at the State Department was demoted over a search of presidential candidate Bill Clinton's passport records. McCormack said one of the individuals who accessed Obama's files also reviewed McCain's file earlier this year. The individual no longer has access to passport records, he said. "I can assure you that person's going to be at the top of the list of the inspector general when they talk to people, and we are currently reviewing our (disciplinary) options with respect to that person," McCormack said. Apologizing and investigating Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke with all three candicates on Friday and expressed her regrets. After speaking with Obama, Rice told reporters: "I told him that I was sorry, and I told him that I myself would be very disturbed." The State Department said the Justice Department would be monitoring the probe in case it needs to get involved.

The statement was accompanied by demands that the Iraqi government issue a general amnesty to his followers and release any being held. The move was welcomed by Iraq's government, whose forces have been fighting al-Sadr's militia, the Mehdi Army, in six days of clashes with so-called "outlaws" who had taken control of much of the southern city of Basra. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who had vowed not to leave Basra until his government reclaimed control of the city, called al-Sadr's statement a "step in the right direction" and said he hoped it would help to stabilize the region. "We renew our assurance that the process of enforcement [of] the law in Basra does not target any political or religious group, including the Sadr movement," al-Maliki said in a prepared statement. Witnesses reported continued clashes throughout the day in Basra even after Sunday's announcements. But Iraqi authorities said after al-Sadr's announcement they would lift an indefinite curfew that had been imposed on Baghdad since Thursday. Watch how the cease-fire affects Shiite vs. Shiite fights » The curfew is scheduled to be lifted 6 a.m. Monday (11 p.m. Sunday ET), said Gen. Qassim Atta, an Iraqi military spokesman.

Two UN contract workers kidnapped in Somalia
(Recasts with UN statement, adds details) By Ibrahim Mohamed and Mohamed Abdi MOGADISHU, April 1 Somali gunmen on Tuesday kidnapped two contractors, a Briton and a Kenyan, working for a U.N.-funded project in southern Somalia, the United Nations said. Local militias were pursuing the kidnappers in the hope of freeing the captives, residents said, and local clan elders were pressing the gunmen to release the two men. "Two foreign nationals -- a Briton and a Kenyan -- were abducted this morning by unknown gunmen between Saakow and Bu'aale in Middle Juba," the U.N. country office for Somalia said in a statement. The two work for Genesys International Corporation Ltd of Bangalore, India, which has been hired by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation to carry out a survey of the Juba and Shabelle rivers, the statement said. "Witnesses on the ground say there was gunfire when the men were taken, but there is no information to suggest that any serious injury was sustained by either man," it said, referring to reports that one of the men had been wounded. The two are being held in or near the town of Jilib, and "clan elders and community leaders who do not condone such abductions are putting pressure on the perpetrators to release the men," the statement said. "These foreign men have been in Sakow for three days, there is no tight administration there and they have not contacted us over their security. We are just trying our best to free them safely," regional chairman Ibrahim Noleye said. Kidnapping is a lucrative business for Somali criminals, who usually treat their captives well, seeing them as investments on which they expect to earn a good return in the form of ransom. But kidnapping is relatively rare in southern Somalia as the region is too dangerous for most aid workers.

Gen. Petraeus, Amb. Crocker testify before US Armed Services Committee
In a reprise of their testimony last September, Army Gen. David H. Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker came to Capitol Hill today to tell lawmakers that security has improved in Iraq and that the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has taken steps toward political reconciliation and economic stability. But unlike in September, when that news was fresh and the administration said a corner had been turned, even some of the war's strongest supporters in Congress have grown impatient and frustrated. Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, and Crocker are facing many lawmakers today and tomorrow who had expected more by now and who are wondering whether any real change will occur before the clock runs out on the Bush administration. "I think all of us realize we're disappointed at where we are," Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said at a hearing last week. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.) asked, "How do we get out of this mess?" While the cost in U.S. lives and money increases, said another senior GOP senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity: "We cannot . Among the questions these and other lawmakers said they plan to ask Petraeus and Crocker is why the United States is still paying for Iraqi domestic needs ranging from military training to garbage pickup when the Maliki government has $30 billion in reserves -- held in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland -- as well as $10 billion in a development fund, significant budgetary surpluses from previous years and a projected 7 percent economic growth rate for 2008. "They're perfectly content to watch us spend our money while they build up these huge cash reserves from oil windfalls.

Pope Benedict XVI visit to the United States begins
Miguel Lenarduzzi travelled for 24 hours by van from Texas to join more than 13,000 of the faithful from across the US to welcome Pope Benedict XVI to Washington today. "We made a long trip. But our faith is bigger than that. The thousands of people here just want to say hi to the Pope," the 43-year-old waiter said. With the country in the grip of Pope-mania, about 9,000 gathered on the White House lawn to hear the pontiff. Another 4,000-plus without tickets, like Lenarduzzi, lined the streets outside to sing, pray and catch a glimpse of his motorcade. The Pope, making his first visit to the US since his election in 2005, was greeted on the White House lawn by President Bush, and given a 21-gun salute and a serenade from a top opera singer. Spectators sang happy birthday to Benedict — 81 today — who smiled, clasped his hands together and bowed in acknowledgement. Lenarduzzi, who travelled in a convoy of nine vans from Dallas, had four hours' sleep before getting up early to bag a spot in the street close to the White House. There had been an expectation that this Pope, only the second to visit the White House, might not generate the same fervour as his predecessor, whose charisma he does not share.

'Expelled' producers accused of copyright violations
Having ruffled feathers in the scientific community, the filmmakers behind a documentary questioning evolution theory have now incurred the wrath of one of the most powerful figures in the popular music business, Yoko Ono, and have generated a blogosphere mini-drama in the process. The flap concerns the film's use of the song "Imagine," by the late John Lennon. Bloggers had accused Ms. Ono, Mr. Lennon's wife, of selling out... All: Well, it's been an interesting time since I first published this. I never thought that someone, far less Ben Stein, would take a song as famous as "Imagine" and use it in his film without permission. However, I have learned that in fact Yoko Ono did not license the song for use in the film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, and any use of the song in that film is being made without authorization. But this Friday, a new movie comes out; one that is nothing more than creationist propaganda in the fine tradition of cigarettes don't kill you and global warming is just a natural occurrence. But what hasn't been discussed as much is the fact that Yoko Ono either sold or gave the rights to "Imagine" to the producers of the film. I guess that the $20 million plus the estate earns every year isn't enough for Yoko Ono, not only does she feel the need to license the song out, she probably held out for the highest bidder, in this case, the money behind the movie, Walt Ruloff, who made over one hundred million dollars selling his company to Microsoft. (Irony is that a company who makes computers, perhaps the ultimate daily example of the higher power of science in our lives, indirectly funded a movie that doesn't believe science should be taught in schools.)

Pope addresses UN in NY as US visit continues
And in a passage that will have particular resonance for the current United Nations leadership, which is trying to establish the right of the outside world to intervene in situations where nations fail to shield their own citizens from atrocities, the pope said that “every state has the primary duty to protect its own population from grave and sustained violations of human rights.” Photo The concept, known as “responsibility to protect,” is one that Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general, has championed as a way for international institutions to take action in regions like Darfur. “If states are unable to guarantee such protection,” the pope said, “the international community must intervene with the juridical means provided in the United Nations charter and in other international instruments.” In an apparent allusion to countries that claim such international actions constitute intervention in their national affairs, he said instead they “should never be interpreted as an unwarranted imposition or a limitation of sovereignty.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story He added, “On the contrary, it is indifference or failure to intervene that do the real damage.” On his fourth day in America —and his first visit as pope — Benedict traveled north from Washington on “Shepherd One,” the Alitalia papal plane, to New York, where he will visit ground zero and celebrate Mass at Yankee Stadium before departing for Rome on Sunday night. He was greeted by Cardinal Edward C. Egan, head of the New York archdiocese, and a host of state and Catholic officials at a low-key ceremony on the tarmac of Kennedy International Airport. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After traveling by helicopter and motorcade to the United Nations, Benedict delivered a speech that touched on themes important both to his three-year-old papacy and his decades of writing as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At base, the pope presented the idea that there are universal values that transcend the diversity — cultural, ethnic or ideological — embodied in an institution like the United Nations, founded to help prevent the ruin of another world war. Photo Benedict was introduced to the thronged General Assembly hall by Mr. Ban, who called the United Nations a secular institution but is “home to all men and women of faith around the world.” Mr. Ban said the pope supported many of the goals of the United Nations, such as climate change, world peace, the eradication of poverty, and maintaining a dialogue among the world’s religions. The speech to the General Assembly is a papal tradition: Pope Paul VI made an appearance in 1965, and Pope John Paul II in 1979 and 1995. On Friday afternoon, Benedict met with members of the local Jewish clergy at the Park East Synagogue, a historic Upper East Side Orthodox congregation founded by Austro-Hungarian Jews in 1890. It was the first papal visit to a synagogue in this country, and only two other visits have ever been recorded, both in Europe.

Hillary Clinton wins Pennsylvania, cuts Obama's lead
A defiant Hillary Clinton signalled today she is staying in the Democratic race for the long haul after beating Barack Obama in the key Pennsylvania primary. With 95% of the precincts reporting, Clinton racked up 1,181,047 votes, 55%, to Obama's 972,236, 45%. Speaking at a victory party in Philadelphia, she vowed to fight on, in spite of Obama holding an almost unassailable lead overall. In a passionate speech, Clinton rejected calls from inside the party to bring the protracted contest to an end by standing down. "Some counted me out and said to drop out," she said. She said it was "long road" to the White House, and appealed for funds for her cash-strapped campaign, which is carrying a debt of $10m, in contrast with the millions Obama has raised. "Tonight, more than ever, I need your help to continue this journey ... We can only keep winning if we can keep competing with an opponent who outspends us so massively," she said. But he claimed that he had done better than expected, defying those who had said he would be "blown out of the water" and had closed the 20-point lead she had had the start of the Pennsylvania campaign. If the margin of Clinton's win had been small, she would have faced a chorus of calls today from senior Democrats to quit in the interests of party unity.

US claims North Korea helped Syria build reactor bombed by Israel
The White House was today set to reveal video images it claims support allegations that North Korea was helping Syria to build a nuclear reactor. The suspected reactor was destroyed by Israeli planes last September in a raid reminiscent of its 1981 raid on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq. Little remains known about the raid seven months later, and today's evidence has been keenly anticipated. US media reports said the video images – believed to have been obtained via Israeli intelligence - show Korean faces among the workers at the Syrian plant. The reports said the video also revealed that the Syrian reactor core's design was the same as that of the North Korean reactor at Yongbon, including a virtually identical configuration and number of holes for fuel rods. Following the Israeli attack, Syria kept relatively quiet about the bombing raid on its territory, bulldozing the area and constructing a new building on the exact location of the old one. Damascus refused to allow international nuclear inspectors to visit the location, fuelling suspicions that it had something to cover up. Speaking in London, the Syrian ambassador to Britain dismissed US accusations that it was helping build a nuclear reactor that could produce plutonium. Sami al-Khiyami told Reuters that the accusation was intended to put pressure on North Korea in talks about Pyongyang's nuclear programme. "This has nothing to do with North Korea and Syria," he said. "The cooperation between North Korea and Syria has nothing to do with [building] a nuclear facility. The Bush administration is going public with the video at a sensitive time in negotiations with North Korea about its nuclear programme.

Livingstone brands Boris 'a joke' in London mayoral elections

REUTERS/Stephen Hird LONDON Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone traded personal attacks on Wednesday as they made a final push for votes on the last day of campaigning in the London mayoral race. The Conservative hopeful sent half a million emails to Londoners accusing Livingstone of being "tired, out-of-date and beset by allegations of sleaze". The Labour mayor posted a million postcards with the message "Don't Vote for a Joke" and predicted voters would decide at the last minute that they couldn't risk electing Johnson. The main candidates have clashed over crime, the congestion charge and public transport. "The election is not a joke, it will affect the day to day life of every Londoner," Livingstone's campaign team said. "The momentum has moved decisively in Ken's direction." In an interview, the mayor predicted that his rival would suffer from "hovering pencil syndrome", where voters decide at the last moment not to take a risk on a change at City Hall. "Although people may be toying with the idea of voting for Boris, when it comes to it they will find they just can't do it," he told Wednesday's Evening Standard newspaper. They have played on his popular image as a floppy-haired joker best known by many as the sometime host of "Have I Got News for You" and as a former newspaper columnist responsible for a string of gaffes.

Johnson ousts Livingstone in London mayoral election
His triumph capped an outstanding set of local election results for the Tories, and suggests David Cameron is well on course to become Prime Minister in two years’ time. The final declaration was delayed as record turn-out led tellers to continue counting ballots well into the evening. Mr Johnson’s victory was in part secured as a result of the increased numbers who took to the polls, as his team’s successful “doughnut strategy” of wooing natural Tories in the outer boroughs who in the past failed to vote in London elections proved devastating for Labour. The toppled mayor, Ken Livingstone, proved equally successful in getting the vote out in his inner London heartland, but was outnumbered by the more numerous suburban residents. Such was the strength of the campaign run by the Australian Lynton Crosby, that at one stage it even looked as if Mr Johnson would be declared the winner on first preference votes. In the end, it took the second preferences of the defeated Liberal Democrats and the minor parties to secure Mr Johnson victory by a margin greater than even he had hoped to dare for. The result means that Londoners have swapped one of the most colourful politicians in the country for an even more flamboyant character. The mayor-to-be spent the day at his home in North London, leaving only to go for a jog accompanied by a number of camera crews. Boris Johnson has won the race to become the next mayor of London - ending Ken Livingstone's eight-year reign at City Hall. The Conservative candidate won with 1,168,738 first and second preference votes, compared with Mr Livingstone's 1,028,966 on a record turnout of 45%.

The advisers said they were dispirited over the loss in North Carolina, after her campaign — now working off a shoestring budget as spending outpaces fund-raising — decided to allocate millions of dollars and full days of the candidate and her husband in the state.

Large earthquake hits central China
CHENGDU, China (CNN) -- Rainy weather and poor logistics thwarted efforts by relief troops who walked for hours over rock, debris and mud on Tuesday in hopes of reaching the worst-hit area of an earthquake that killed nearly 10,000 in central China, state-run media reported. Setting out from Maerkang in Sichuan Province at 8 p.m. Monday, the 100 or so troops had to travel 200 kilometers (124 miles) to go before reaching Wenchuan, the epicenter of the quake, also in the province, Xinhua reported. After seven hours, they still had 70 kilometers (43 miles) to go. "I have seen many collapsed civilian houses, and the rocks dropped from mountains on the roadside are everywhere," the head of the unit, Li Zaiyuan, told Xinhua. Added CNN Correspondent John Vause: "The roads here are terrible in the best of times ... right now they're down right atrocious. They've resorted to going in one man at a time on foot." Nearly all the confirmed deaths were in Sichuan Province, but rescuers were hindered because roads linking it to the provincial capital, Chengdu, were damaged, Xinhua reported. Local radio quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. An expert told CNN the 7.9-magnitude quake at about 2:28 p.m. Monday (6:28 a.m. GMT) was the largest the region has seen "for over a generation." Residents as far as Chongqing -- about 200 miles from the epicenter in Sichuan Province -- spent the night outdoors, too afraid of aftershocks to sleep indoors. Local radio in Sichuan quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged.

Pakistan's coalition government faces split
ISLAMABAD May 13 Pakistanis are shocked by the split of a six-week-old coalition government on which they had pinned hopes for stability and change, and fear another bout of political polarisation and instability. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who heads the second biggest party in the coalition, announced on Monday his members, were quitting the cabinet after failing to reach agreement with the party of slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto on the restoration of judges fired by President Pervez Musharraf. The two parties defeated former army chief Musharraf's allies in a February election and their alliance had raised hopes for a stable civilian government in a country ruled by generals for more than half its history since its independence in 1947. "I voted in the hope that something good will happen but I don't see that," said Nighat Anis, a teacher at a school on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad. The fate of the judges has monopolised the attention of the coalition parters since the election, to the cost, critics say, of action on surging inflation, a slumping currency and stocks and the fight against militancy. The rupee PKR=PK has fallen more than 10 percent this year as the brewing political crisis has undermined a currency under pressure from a surging oil import bill and fiscal deficit. Nuclear-armed Pakistan's Western allies in the campaign against terrorism dread more instability in a country plagued by turbulence since March last year when Musharraf tried to dismiss the country's top judge, touching off protests. As part of his efforts to secure another term as president, Musharraf fired about 60 judges seen as hostile to him in November, after he imposed a brief state of emergency. "POLITICS OF VENDETTA" Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf ousted when he seized power in 1999, had made the restoration of the judges his main condition for joining a coalition with Bhutto's party, led by her widower, Asif Ali Zardari, since her assassination in December. But the restoration of the judges is likely to spark a showdown with Musharraf and the two leaders failed to agree on how it should be done. While pulling his party out of the coalition after a deadline for the return of the judges passed, Sharif promised not to destabilise it and to support it on an issue-by-issue basis.

Coordinated series of bombs kills at least 80 in India
The seven bombs killed 80 people including 10 children and injured another 200 when they went off over a 20-minute period in the city’s crowded bazaars on Tuesday evening. An eighth device failed to detonate. “We have arrested two people and have detained several more for questioning,” said Vasundhara Raje, the chief minister of Rajasthan state of which Jaipur is the capital. Mrs Raje, who belongs to the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, made a thinly veiled jibe at India’s neighbouring nuclear rival Pakistan. “This seems to have been done by some international group,” she claimed. Mrs Raje also said that the bombs used in the attack were a mix of plastic RDX explosive, ammonium nitrate and ball-bearings that acted like tiny missiles once the devices were detonated. Officials and witnesses said these ball bearings, which were yesterday still embedded in walls and doors in areas where the blasts took place, were largely responsible for the fatalities. Officials said the bombs were all tied to newly purchased bicycles and scattered in a 500 yard arc around the busy market place that is the hub of Jaipur’s emerald and gold market and the city’s principal commercial centre. "They (the bombs) were ensured to inflict the maximum damage at a time when the market was packed,” said R S Malik, a banker who witnessed one of the explosions near a Hindu temple.

US says polar bears are threatened species
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Polar bears will now be listed as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act. Scientists predict that two-thirds of the world's polar bears will disappear in the next 50 years. But in announcing the listing, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne said the decision should not be "misused" to regulate global climate change. But it should not open the door to use of the Endangered Species Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, power plants, and other sources," said Kempthorne. "That would be a wholly inappropriate use of the ESA law. The ESA is not the right tool to set U.S. climate policy." Watch Kempthorne explain the decision » While there are an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears now in the Arctic, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey predict two thirds of the world's polar bears will disappear in the next 50 years because of a decline in Arctic sea ice. Learn more about polar bears and their habitat » Controversy over the status of the polar bear is tied to the fact that this is the first time a species has been considered for listing specifically because its habitat is threatened by global warming. Some environmental groups are wary of some of the climate change caveats to the decision, saying it weakens protection for the animals. "This decision is a watershed event because it has forced the Bush administration to acknowledge global warming's brutal impacts," said Kassie Siegel, climate program director at the Center for Biological Diversity. "It's not too late to save the polar bear, and we'll keep fighting to ensure that the polar bear gets the help it needs through the full protections of the Endangered Species Act.

John Edwards endorses Barack Obama
It would have meant more in February or March, but John Edwards' endorsement of Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination was welcomed nonetheless by a politician eager to turn the page. Edwards' surprise appearance at a rally Wednesday steered some of the attention away from Hillary Rodham Clinton's landslide win over Obama in Tuesday's West Virginia primary. Despite the victory, the former first lady faces long odds in trying to deny Obama the presidential nomination. Edwards had been their chief rival from 2007 through last January. But after finishing second to Obama in Iowa, the former North Carolina senator and 2004 vice presidential nominee placed third in the next three contests, then left the race. Obama and Clinton immediately sought his support, but Edwards stayed mum until Wednesday. The endorsement would have carried more clout had Edwards made it months ago, when the outcome of the Democratic contest was very much in doubt. "We are here tonight because the Democratic voters have made their choice, and so have I," Edwards said to thunderous applause. He said Obama "stands with me" in a fight to cut poverty in half within 10 years, a claim Obama confirmed moments later. Praise for Clinton Edwards told the rally that "we must come together as Democrats" to defeat Republican John McCain in November. "We are a stronger party" because of her involvement and "we're going to have a stronger nominee in the fall because of her work," he said.

Child virus outbreak reaches Beijing
BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The death toll in China's outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease has risen to 42 children, with the capital Beijing reporting its first case Wednesday, state media said. Parents sit with children being treated for the virus in Fuyang, China, last month. The child died on the way to a hospital Sunday, health authorities told the Xinhua news agency. Another child died of the virus at a Beijing hospital, but that death was counted in the child's home province of Hebei, which neighbors Beijing, the news agency said. So far, the virus has sickened 24,934 children on the Chinese mainland, authorities said. The deaths are blamed on enterovirus 71, or EV-71, one of the most common causes of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD). The official count of infections has increased dramatically in recent days since an order issued late last week by the Ministry of Health mandating that all cases be reported. HFMD can be caused by a number of intestinal viruses, of which EV-71 and Coxsackie A16 are among the most common. Adults with well-developed immune systems can usually fend off the virus, but children are particularly vulnerable to it, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Public health officials expect the number of cases to peak this summer, since the disease thrives in warm weather.

I cherished his confidence and momentous support in my race for the Presidency. And even as he waged a valiant struggle with a mortal illness, I've profited as President from his encouragement and wisdom. An important chapter in our history has come to an end. Our country has lost a great leader, who picked up the torch of his fallen brothers and became the greatest United States Senator of our time. Vice President Joe Biden: "It was infectious when you were with him. You could see it, those of you who knew him and those of you who didn't know him. You could just see it in the nature of his debate, in the nature of his embrace, in the nature of how he every single day attacked these problems. And in the process of his doing, he made everybody he worked with bigger -- both his adversaries as well as his allies." Bill Clinton, former president: "Senator Ted Kennedy was one of the most influential leaders of our time, and one of the greatest senators in American history.

UK minor faces charges for calling Scientology 'cult' at protest
The boy, who is described only as a minor, was taking part in a demonstration outside the church's central London headquarters on May 10 when City of London Police officers ordered him to remove the placard. It read: "Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult." When he refused, he was issued with a form of summons for an alleged breach of public order. Police plan to pass a file to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether charges can be brought. The boy was part of a group who gathered outside the church's premises on Queen Victoria Street, close to St Paul's Cathedral. After a complaint from the church, several demonstrators were told to remove signs but the youth was the only one who refused. A spokesman for the force said the youth had been "reported" under section five of the Public Order Act, which contains measures against displaying signs considered to be "threatening, abusive or insulting". The document did not specify any date for appearance in court. Writing anonymously on an internet forum, the boy said: "Within five minutes of arriving … I was told by a member of the police that I was not allowed to use 'that word'." Chief Supt Rob Bastable said: "City of London Police upholds the right to demonstrate lawfully, but we have to balance that with the right of all sections of community not to be alarmed, harassed or distressed as a result of other people's behaviour."

Bangladesh reports first human case of H5N1 bird flu
GENEVA The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday confirmed the first human case of bird flu in Bangladesh, a baby boy who has recovered, bringing the number of countries which have recorded human infections to 15. Bangladesh authorities announced the case on Thursday, and the WHO said it had been confirmed by a laboratory at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. "The case was confirmed by CDC in Atlanta. It is the first in Bangladesh," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told Reuters. Bangladesh authorities informed the United Nations agency promptly about the case but it took time for the international laboratory testing to be completed, Hartl said. The H5N1 virus was first detected in Bangladesh in March last year and since then the authorities have culled around 2 million chickens and destroyed more than 2 million eggs. Avian influenza has spread through 47 of Bangladesh's 64 districts, causing losses of about 45 billion taka ($650 million) for the growing poultry sector, which accounts for 1.6 percent of the impoverished nation's gross domestic product. "When a disease is so widespread in poultry, it is really a matter of time before you get a human case. It shows the need to control the disease in animals if you are going to reduce the chances of transmission to humans," Hartl said. The virus rarely infects people but experts fear it could mutate or combine with the highly contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a pandemic, which could kill millions of people. Prior to the Bangladesh case, 14 countries had reported 382 cases including 241 fatalities since 2003, according to the WHO. Bangladesh announced its first known human case of bird flu, in a child who was infected in January. The government health department said that the child tested negative initially, but that tests of his virus culture by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention turned up positive this week.

World Health Organization calls for ban on tobacco ads
World No Tobacco Day is held annually on 31 May The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called on governments to ban all tobacco advertising to help prevent young people taking up the habit. It accused manufacturers of using increasingly sophisticated marketing techniques to ensare young people, particularly girls in poorer countries. The UN agency says the more they are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely people will start smoking. The organisation said only 5% of the world's population was covered by comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. It says current restrictions are not enough to protect the world's 1.8bn young people, who are targeted through the intenet, magazines, films, concerts and sporting events. 'Dangerous messages' In Russia, which has few anti-smoking laws, the number of female and adolescent smokers has tripled in the last decade. However, in Canada, where smoking and cigarette advertising has been severely restricted, numbers of smokers are at their lowest in 40 years. The WHO also accused manufacturers of continuing to attract young people by "falsely" associating cigarettes with "glamour, energy and sex appeal". In a WHO worldwide survey of 13 to 15 year olds, 55% reported seeing billboard advertisements for tobacco, while 20% owned an item with a cigarette brand logo.

Helicopter carrying quake survivors crashes in China
China quake helicopter crashes with 14 on board Updated A military helicopter crashed while evacuating injured survivors of China's earthquake, underlining the lingering risks of a disaster that has left more than 68,000 dead. The chopper crashed on Saturday (local time) amid fog and strong turbulence as its crew of four was evacuating 10 injured residents from quake-hit areas in south-west China's Sichuan province, state-run Xinhua news agency said. The crash highlights the ongoing challenges as China seeks to respond to a tragedy that has also left nearly 15 million people homeless and raised fears of epidemic outbreaks in affected areas. The helicopter had ferried a team of military experts on disease outbreaks to Li county and was returning with the injured residents when it lost contact with ground command, Xinhua reported. President Hu Jintao, touring quake-stricken areas in neighbouring Shaanxi province, immediately ordered a search and rescue operation, Xinhua said. The overall death toll from the earthquake, China's worst natural disaster in a generation, reached 68,977 on Saturday, with another 17,974 missing, the Government said. The lake, formed when a huge landslide blocked the Jian River, has emerged as the most serious lingering threat to the region's traumatised citizens, as it poses a flood risk to areas populated by more than one million people. More than 197,000 people had been evacuated in case of flooding, officials told AFP, but a total of 1.3 million stood ready to move should the controlled release of water turn into a flood. They now hope to slowly drain away water in the lake, whose level has been rising by nearly two metres a day. "About 1.3 million people are prepared for evacuation," a disaster relief official in Mianyang city downstream from the lake, who gave only his surname Pu, told AFP on Saturday.

US Senator Kennedy has brain tumor surgically removed
Mark Schreiner with Duke University Hospital hands out statements to the media about Senator Edward Kennedy's brain surgery at Duke University Hospital in Durham, North Carolina, June 2, 2008. REUTERS/Brian Snyder DURHAM, North Carolina U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Democratic icon and a leading backer of presidential contender Barack Obama, had successful surgery on Monday to remove a malignant brain tumor and should suffer "no permanent neurological effects," his surgeon said. "I am pleased to report that Senator Kennedy's surgery was successful and accomplished our goals," Dr. Allan Friedman said in a statement after a 3 1/2-hour operation at Duke University's Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. After the surgery, Kennedy told his wife, Vicki, "I feel like a million bucks," an aide to the senator said. Friedman, Duke's chief of neurosurgery, did not specify how much of the cancerous tumor he was able to remove. He called the operation "the first step" in a treatment plan for the 76-year-old senator from Massachusetts, head of America's most fabled political family. "After a brief recuperation, he will begin targeted radiation at Massachusetts General Hospital and chemotherapy treatment," Friedman said. Dr. Mark Gilbert of the University of Texas' cancer center, speaking at a news conference at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago, said: "If all you do is surgery, even if you do a beautiful job, the tumor will be back in one or two months" without other treatments. Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor called a glioma, a type of tumor that usually kills within three years, after suffering a seizure on May 17. But Friedman said, "Senator Kennedy was awake during the resection (tumor removal) and should therefore experience no permanent neurological effects from the surgery."

Barack Obama effectively clinches Democratic nomination
(CNN) -- The titanic struggle for the Democratic candidacy neared its end Tuesday with final voting expected to push Hillary Clinton aside and usher in Barack Obama as the first ever black U.S. presidential nomination for a major political party. After months of primaries and caucuses, the Democratic party still does not have a nominee. Clinton's campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe told CNN Clinton will not concede at a New York rally being held after voting closes Tuesday night in the last two primary states. That was a reaction to an Associated Press story quoting two senior Clinton campaign officials as saying she will concede Tuesday night or early Wednesday that Obama has done enough to secure the Democratic nomination, while stopping short of formally suspending or ending her race. But Clinton told New York lawmakers she is willing to be the vice presidential nominee on Obama's presidential ticket, those lawmakers told CNN. Democrats in South Dakota and Montana cast the final votes Tuesday in a long and bitter campaign that has cost the candidates dearly in dollars and left the party struggling to unite to challenge Republican John McCain and succeed George W. Bush at the White House. Obama needs the support of about 40 more Democratic delegates to make the 2,118 needed to capture the nomination at the party's August convention but he is likely to depend on superdelegates -- party officials free to back any candidate -- to tip the balance. The Illinois senator, who has sought to dispel fears of inexperience by campaigning on a message of change, has emerged as favorite in recent weeks despite a dogged campaign by Clinton who as former first lady claims to have more political experience. Although campaigns for both parties said there had been no formal discussion, sources close to Clinton said she was poised to acknowledge her inevitable defeat by Tuesday signaling her willingness to accept an offer of becoming Obama's running mate if asked. "In her speech tomorrow night she will convey the message that first and foremost she is committed to Democrats winning in November and will do whatever she's asked to do," a close friend of the New York senator said. Her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, also told voters in South Dakota on Monday that "this may be the last day I'm ever involved in a campaign of this kind." Watch how the race could end » Obama insiders are said to be split over whether a joint ticket with Clinton will be a good idea, with some doubting she can deliver, despite claims the pairing would help "ram down the animosity" between supporters of the two that many fear could cost the Democrats the election. Democratic Party insiders are also discussing how to patch up Clinton's relationship with the black community and how to bring African American Clinton supporters into the Obama fold, several top Clinton supporters said.

On Tuesday, Pakistani investigators searched through the rubble at the scene of the explosion, which came weeks after al-Qaeda threatened Denmark over published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. Danish investigators were expected to join the probe. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service, known as PET, said in a statement late Monday that the embassy was the likely target. "It is PET's assessment that al-Qaeda or an al-Qaeda-related group likely is behind the attack," agency director Jakob Scharf said. He added that "a series of other militant Islamic groups and networks in Pakistan also could have the intention and the capacity to hit Danish targets in Pakistan." It wounded some 35 people, left a deep crater on the road outside the embassy and severely damaged a development group's office nearby.

US and UK diplomats detained in Zimbabwe
(CNN) -- U.S. and British diplomats are safe after Zimbabwe police, soldiers and "war veterans" stopped their convoy Thursday and threatened to burn them alive, U.S. officials said. Ambassador James McGee visits a reported victim of political violence at a Harare clinic this month. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said five American Embassy employees and two local staff members had been detained. "While this immediate incident has been resolved, it will not be forgotten," McCormack said. Just hours after the incident, Zimbabwe Social Welfare Minister Nicholas Goche said that all aid organizations were ordered to cease operations in the country until the presidential runoff is concluded, a journalist in the country said. Despite Goche's announcement, Boniface Chidyausiku, the Zimbabwean ambassador to the United Nations, said CARE International was the only aid group told to suspend work. The government had accused some of the 300 CARE employees in Zimbabwe -- mostly Zimbabweans -- of passing out brochures in favor of an opposition political party, CARE spokesman Kenneth Walker said. Chidyausiku said the Zimbabwean minister of social services is reviewing the activity of all non-governmental organizations in light of accusations that some have been politicizing their operations and campaigning for the opposition. "What we find is that there have been complaints about NGOs operating as Trojan horses for the oppositions, but the opposition has denied it," he said. Fore told CNN that the "suspension is a direct threat to the lives and well-being of tens of thousands of innocent people in Zimbabwe."

By Farai Sevenzo Harare Basic foods are fast becoming beyond the reach of even those with jobs In the week in which world leaders met in Rome to discuss an ongoing global food crisis, will Zimbabwe's own food crisis be exacerbated by the announcement that aid groups and non-governmental organisations should stop operations at once and re-apply for their permits? Put together the facts - a recurring poor harvest of basic cereals like maize and wheat; persistent droughts; a farming infrastructure which has been in renewal or chaos; economic inflation beating even the projected figures - and you can see that this country is seriously in need of the kind of assistance these groups have been told to stop providing.

Ireland rejects EU Lisbon Treaty
PA Photos Protestors calling for a No vote before the Lisbon treaty referendum, hand out flyers in Dublin city centre. Officials in Brussels and other European capitals appeared shell-shocked as they absorbed the news they had dreaded to hear on Friday the 13th: Irish voters had rejected the Lisbon Treaty aimed at updating the European Union's creaking institutions. Ireland's population of 4.2 million amounts to less than 1% of the E.U. 's 490 million citizens, but in the mire of the defeat that offered no comfort to E.U. The Union's consensus-based decision-making system requires that all 27-member states approve the treaty, and a veto by one is enough to torpedo it. Ireland was the only member state to submit the long and confusing document to a popular referendum, and the resulting "no" vote, by a decisive margin of 54% to 46%, has created a crsisis for the E.U. The Irish result set off a whirl of confusion, with officials struggling to suggest how the E.U. "The Treaty is not dead," said European Commission President José Manuel Barroso. "The ratification process is made up of 27 national processes, 18 member states have already approved the treaty, and the European Commission believes that the remaining ratifications should continue to take their course," he said. If no immediate contingency plan is apparent, it is because the Lisbon Treaty was already the E.U.

Iran says its nuclear program is unchanged
(CNN) -- Iran's government spokesman on Saturday reiterated its right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes, a state-run news agency reported. Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki has suggested that Iran would never launch an unprovoked attack on Israel. Gholam-Hossein Elham made the remark to reporters a day after Iran delivered a response to a world powers proposal that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment in exchange for economic and other incentives, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. World leaders, such as those from the West, the U.N. Security Council and Israel, have been suspicious that Iran is using its nuclear program to develop weaponry. Iran has consistently disputed that and said it plans to use nuclear power for energy. Elham said "Iran's stand on the issue has not changed" and that Iran "will not withdraw from legitimate rights of its people," IRNA reported. "Tehran's stand is based on the legitimate rights of the Iranian nation as well as the international regulations. The incentives proposal to Iran was made last month by the foreign ministers of the five U.N. Security Council permanent members -- the United States, Britain, China, Russia and France -- and by the foreign minister of Germany, which has been involved in nuclear negotiations, and by European Union security chief Javier Solana. Watch what a deal could mean » Iran responded to those ministers on Friday. Saeed Jalili, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, told Solana in a phone call that Iran's response focused on "common ground between the two sides and a constructive and creative view," according to Iranian news reports. Along with the incentives, the European Union, acting on behalf of the world powers, also is offering a six-week "pre-negotiations" phase proposal, a gesture of goodwill and an effort to jump-start talks that have been at an impasse over Iran's nuclear aspirations. It is calling for suspending any new sanctions if Iran takes a six-week break from installing or manufacturing any more centrifuges that enrich uranium. That would mean Iran would be allowed to continue to use the more than 3,000 centrifuges it already has but could not manufacture more in that period.

Hurricane Bertha strengthens over Atlantic Ocean
Hurricane Bertha is seen in a satellite image taken on July 7, 2008. REUTERS/NOAA/Handout MIAMI Strengthening far more swiftly and vigorously than predicted, Hurricane Bertha became a "major" hurricane in the open Atlantic on Monday, with sustained winds of at least 115 miles per hour (185 kph), U.S. forecasters said. The second named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season was heading west-northwest in the direction of Bermuda when it became a Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity, the National Hurricane Center said. "A gradual turn toward the northwest with a decrease in forward speed is expected over the next couple of days," the Miami-based center said. That could take Bertha near Bermuda, a wealthy mid-Atlantic British colony that is viewed as one of the more storm-proof islands in the region, with tough building codes and a storm-conscious population. The National Hurricane Center said it did not expect Bertha to get much stronger due to unfavorable atmospheric conditions in its path. But the storm has already delivered surprises and forecasting long-range hurricane intensities and tracks is an uncertain science. At 5 p.m. EDT, the storm's center was located around 1,150 miles southeast of Bermuda and it was moving at around 12 mph (19 kph) to the west-northwest. Energy markets have paid close attention Atlantic storms since the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, during which a number of powerful hurricanes ripped through the Gulf of Mexico, toppling oil rigs and severing pipelines. The record 2005 season, which included Katrina which swamped New Orleans and killed 1,500 people on the U.S. Gulf Coast, saw 28 storms.

Mr Cameron and former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith joined candidate Davena Rankin in the constituency on Monday. Labour, which has yet to choose a candidate, said it was getting people off benefits and into work. The SNP campaign launched with a call for action on rising energy costs. During his campaign visit, Mr Cameron said it was the Conservative's mission "to heal the wounds of poverty, crime, social disorder and deprivation". He said social breakdown in Glasgow East was simply an "extreme version" of what could be seen elsewhere and highlighted the high level of welfare dependency and knife crime. Whether it is knife crime or any other symptom of our broken society, we will repair the damage by treating not just the symptoms, but the causes too David Cameron Conservative leader In full: Glasgow East candidates "This is the broken society by-election," said Mr Cameron. "It comes in a place where the people are shouting 'Gordon Brown, wasn't Labour supposed to end this degrading poverty?'. "It comes at a time when the country is asking 'What is going on with the knife crime and violence on our streets?'." Mr Cameron said the Conservatives had a clear plan to foster social cohesion while they attempted to rebuild the economy and improve the NHS.

Iran conducts nine missile tests
Advertisement The US and Israel have condemned Iran after it test-fired a long range missile capable of reaching Tel Aviv. Iran state media said nine missiles had been fired in total, including a new Shahab-3, with a range of 2,000km (1,240 miles). Tehran has tested the missile before, but the latest launch comes amid rising tensions with the US and Israel over the country's nuclear programme. A senior US state department official said the launch was "provocative". Wednesday's early morning test at a remote desert site sent oil prices climbing. Israel should prepare itself to do what is needed to do Ze'ev Boim Israeli minister Brig Gen Hoseyn Salami, commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' air force, said: "Our missiles are ready for shooting at any place and any time, quickly and with accuracy." Western leaders have been attempting to convince Tehran to stop enriching uranium, which it has continued doing despite sanctions from the UN and the European Union, insisting its nuclear programme is purely for civilian energy. US Under-secretary of State William Burns said that thanks to UN sanctions, Iran's real progress on its nuclear programme had been "modest", despite its sabre-rattling. "We view force as an option that is on the table but a last resort," he told a Congressional hearing on Wednesday. Our correspondent - who is in Israel - says the country has a fully operational anti-ballistic missile system, which Israeli military experts believe can counter any Iranian threat.

Chaotic first day for iPhone 3G
Sang Tang / AP A customer looks at a new Apple iPhone 3G at the Apple retail store in Regent Street, London. Anticipation quickly turned to frustration on Friday for the millions of Apple customers trying to upgrade their old iPhones to the new software, or activate their newly purchased iPhone 3G. With Apple's servers overloaded and unable to accommodate customer demand, eager buyers who had camped out all week to acquire the new phone were thwarted. Though the new-generation phones were designed to be activated in-store, salespeople instructed customers Friday to go home, connect the phone to a personal computer and download new software to activate it. Apple did not return phone calls or emails asking for an explanation of its launch-day problems, but by 10 p.m. EST on Friday, this reporter at long last reached a technical support representative, who identified himself only as George: "It's been crazy the whole day," he said. "Our server has been really busy and has been timing out." The logjam was a major misstep for a company that markets its products as simpler, more elegant and easier to use than the competition's. "The store is basically broken at this point," said Michael Rose, a blogger for tuaw.com, which reports on Apple.

Italian officials found guilty of abusing G8 protestors
GENOA, Italy (Reuters) — An Italian court found 15 police officers guilty on Monday of beating protesters at the Group of 8 summit meeting in Genoa in 2001. It sentenced them to prison terms ranging from five months to five years. All of those convicted are expected to appeal; none can go to prison until the appeals process is complete, which normally takes years. The heaviest sentence was given to an inspector in the penitentiary police department. The police were accused of organized brutality at the Diaz high school, where protesters were camping during the summit meeting, and later at the Bolzaneto police barracks, where arrested protesters were taken. The three-day summit meeting in 2001 was a focus of protests by antiglobalization, left-wing and anti-American demonstrators. · Sentences up to five years for mistreatment in 2001 · Verdict likely to embarrass Berlusconi government Fifteen Italian police officers and doctors were last night sentenced to jail terms of up to five years after being found guilty of abusing protesters detained during riots at the 2001 G8 summit in Genoa. The sentences totalled less than a third of what had been demanded by the prosecution. But they will nevertheless be embarrassing for Silvio Berlusconi and his rightwing allies, in office in Italy both then and now.

French police search for missing explosives
PARIS French anti-terrorism police are investigating the theft of 28 kg (61 lbs) of plastic explosives from a site near the southeastern city of Lyon, officials said on Friday. Staff at a mine clearance centre at Corbas, near Lyon, noticed that thieves had apparently broken into the site, which was not guarded, and taken explosives and detonators. Interior ministry spokesman Gerard Gachet told France's LCI television that the director of the centre had been suspended for allowing the explosives to be stored at the unsecured site. Semtex has been used by various terrorist groups French anti-terrorist officers are searching for 28kg (61lb) of Semtex explosive missing from a depot in the suburbs of the city of Lyon. France's interior ministry confirmed an investigation was underway, saying the manager of the site had been suspended. Semtex is a powerful explosive favoured by terrorist groups as it is odourless and difficult to detect. The depot, in a disused 19th century fort at Corbas, is used for storing explosives by a civil defence unit charged with the job of blowing up bombs and ammunition left over from the two world wars. Police said the discovery that the Semtex was missing was made on Friday but admitted the explosives could have been taken up to a week ago. In a statement released late on Friday the interior ministry said there had been "security failings" which had made the theft possible. Police sources have declined to confirm a newspaper website report which said that the store had been unguarded. A bomb containing about half a kilogram of the explosive caused the blast which brought down Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people. About 62 pounds (28 kilograms) of explosives were stolen from a depot at the civil security site at Fort de Corbas, the ministry said in a written statement, because of an apparent breach in the site's protection.

Human cells grow blood vessels in mice
WASHINGTON Cells taken from human bone marrow, blood and umbilical cords grew into functioning blood vessels in mice with just the right coaxing, U.S. researchers reported on Saturday. The so-called progenitor cells teamed up to form working blood vessels that connected to the circulatory systems of the mice, the team at Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital Boston reported. "What's really significant about our study is that we are using human cells that can be obtained from blood or bone marrow rather than removing and using fully developed blood vessels," said Harvard's Joyce Bischoff, who led the study. Her team used immature cells, known as progenitor cells, grown under special lab conditions before being implanted into mice. Once implanted, the cell mixture grew and differentiated into a small ball of healthy blood vessels, they reported in the journal Circulation Research, published by the American Heart Association. They used endothelial progenitor cells, which mature into cells that line the blood vessels, and mesenchymal progenitor cells, which differentiate into the cells that surround the lining and provide stability. A mixture of cells from adult blood and bone or from umbilical cord blood worked the best, they said. They hope to find a way to help the body replace blocked or damaged blood vessels, such as arteries blocked in a heart attack or stroke. "What we are most interested in right now is speeding up the vascularization," Bischoff said in a statement. "We see very good and extensive vasculature in seven days and we'd like to see that in 24 or 48 hours. If you have an ischemic tissue, it's dying tissue, so the faster you can establish blood flow the better." One ultimate goal is to replace some heart surgery with injections of laboratory-grown cells that would establish themselves in the body, providing a system of blood vessels for damaged hearts that need more oxygen, said Juan M. Melero-Martin, a co-author of a paper in the July 18 issue of the journalCirculation Research: Journal of the American Heart Association. "We are proving the concept in mice who are compromised so that they don't reject human cells," said Melero-Martin, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital Boston.

Two nuclear leaks in two weeks trigger security and safety reviews in France
French nuclear companies are hoping to play a central role in the government's plan to build a new generation of reactors. At home, however, the industry has been buffeted by a series of mishaps. Angelique Chrisafis reports from Bollène Sylvie Eymard's Provence farmhouse kitchen should be the picture of French rural calm. But the stockpiles of bottled water, disinfectant rinse and disposable paper plates hint at something strange. For the past two weeks, Eymard, 41, and her children, 13 and seven, have had a phobia of taps. To wash up, they go out to the yard and fill a bowl from a specially delivered plastic tank of purified water on a fork-lift tractor. They carry the water up to the bathroom to wash. Even the dog drinks bottled water, and it is left out for the birds. The view from the house over the fields is dominated by the nearby cooling towers of the Tricastin site, a nuclear power plant run by EDF, the company which is poised to buy British Energy and take control of most UK nuclear stations. Next to the plant is a nuclear treatment centre run by a subsidiary of Areva, the nuclear group which hopes to design many of the new British reactors. Last month an accident at the treatment centre during a draining operation saw liquid containing untreated uranium overflow out of a faulty tank. Eymard's house is 100 metres from one of these streams. Like a handful of rural homes near the nuclear site, hers is plumbed into the local groundwater from wells.

Hole in fuselage causes Qantas flight to make emergency landing
Qantas plane makes emergency landing after fuselage rupture Updated A Qantas 747 has made an emergency landing in the Philippines capital Manila because of a large rupture in the plane's fuselage. The flight with 365 people on board was flying from London to Melbourne, via Hong Kong when it was forced to land. None of the passengers have been seriously injured. Less than two hours after flight QF 30 left Hong Kong this morning, the pilot sought an emergency landing at Ninoy Aquino International Airport after reporting a hole in the plane's cargo section near the right wing. The plane was flying at 29,000 feet when its fuselage ruptured causing the cabin to lose air pressure. Passengers on the flight have said that the plane plunged about 20,000 feet and a door apparently popped open. Qantas has confirmed the plane has landed at Manila and is being inspected on the tarmac, but will not say what caused the emergency landing. He said the flight crew performed emergency procedures after oxygen masks were deployed and there were no reports of any injuries. Peter Gibson from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority says initial reports indicate a problem with the air pressure in the cabin. "The pilot has some pressurisation warnings about a door on the left hand side of the aircraft, but exactly what went wrong is still being determined," he said. The Transport Safety Bureau has confirmed a large hole was ripped into the fuselage in the cargo section of the plane. Speaking from the Manila airport, passenger Dr June Kane says she heard a loud bang from underneath the plane, and saw debris fly through the cabin. "I'm looking at the plane now and on the left hand side, just forward of the wing, there's a gaping hole from the wing to the underbody," she said.

US presidential candidate Obama speaks in Berlin, Germany
BERLIN — He didn't break into German, but he spoke of tearing down walls of division, and the crowd loved it. Tens of thousands of Germans, along with some resident Americans, filled Berlin's Tiergarten park to hear Barack Obama talk about the U.S., Europe and their shared visions and challenges. It was a remarkable turnout for the lazy days of late July, when most Germans are more focused on summer vacations than foreign politics. The audience repeatedly interrupted his speech with applause and cheers, and erupted in chants of "Yes, we can!" A lot of Europeans are hoping Obama will give them a reason to love America again. "I expect Obama to be a president who makes it possible to be proud of being a fan of the USA," said Gerda Schulz, a 72-year-old retiree. Schulz has watched historic speeches here by a string of American presidents -- John F. Kennedy in 1963, Ronald Reagan in 1987 and Bill Clinton in 1994 -- and on Thursday added the Democratic presidential contender to the list. "In the last seven years, it was rather embarrassing here to say, 'I like the Americans and I am thankful for what they did for us,' " she said. (CNN) -- Barack Obama touched hearts during an impassioned speech to a 200,000-strong crowd in Berlin, German newspapers agreed, but suspicions remain about the White House contender's motives for courting a European audience. Berlin's Der Tagesspiegel wondered whether so many young people had ever gathered for a political event in Germany and said that Obama's address -- which echoed speeches by former U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan when the divided city was in the Cold War frontline -- could only have been made in the German capital.

US Senate passes housing aid bill
The Senate, convening for a rare Saturday session as it neared summer recess, approved the bill by a vote of 72 to 13, with 27 Republicans joining all the Democrats in attendance to support it. The measure now goes to President Bush, who has said he will sign it, perhaps early next week, to send a reassuring message to the credit markets.

Lawmakers in both parties hailed the bill, saying it was crucially needed. “It will make a difference not only in the housing market but in the entire economy,” the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the chairman of the banking committee, said prior to the vote, “We are in the midst of the most serious economic crisis to face our nation in many years.

Puffin numbers are falling on UK's Farne Islands
By Mark Kinver Science and nature reporter, BBC News  England's biggest colony of puffins has seen the birds' numbers fall by a third in just five years, a survey shows. Experts had expected to see a slight increase in the population on the Farne Islands, owned by the National Trust. The Trust says the size of the decline is unprecedented, adding that it will carry out another survey in 2008 in order to monitor the situation. One theory is that many of the birds are dying from starvation during the eight months they spend at sea. "We were expecting a slight increase because since the last survey in 2003, we had a number of good years for puffins," explained David Steel, the Trust's head warden on the islands. "There were plenty of chicks fledging from the nests, so we were not only getting enough to maintain the population, but increase it. Advertisement Winter losses The three-month survey, carried out on eight of the islands, recorded 36,500 breeding pairs. The population of puffins on the Farne Islands had been growing steadily Mr Steel told BBC News that there was no visible explanation for the decline on the islands. "The birds had been bringing in good quantities of food, and there was not a predator problem on the islands." One suggestion for the downturn is the survival rate over the winter months, when the puffins spend eight months at sea.

NASA to extend the Phoenix probe mission by 5 weeks
The Phoenix spacecraft has tasted Martian water for the first time, scientists reported Thursday. By melting icy soil in one of its lab instruments, the robot confirmed the presence of frozen water lurking below the Martian permafrost. Until now, evidence of ice in Mars' north pole region has been largely circumstantial. In 2002, the orbiting Odyssey spacecraft spied what looked like a reservoir of buried ice. After Phoenix arrived, it found what looked like ice in a hard patch underneath its landing site and changes in a trench indicated some ice had turned to gas when exposed to the sun. Scientists popped open champagne when they received confirmation Wednesday that the soil contained ice. "We've now finally touched it and tasted it," William Boynton of the University of Arizona said during a news conference in Tucson on Thursday. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 on a three-month hunt to determine if it could support life. It is conducting experiments to learn whether the ice ever melted in the red planet's history that could have led to a more hospitable environment. It is also searching for the elusive organic-based compounds essential for simple life forms to emerge. Researchers were able to prove the soil had ice in it because it melted in the oven at 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 Celsius) — the melting point of ice — and released water molecules.

Suspect in 2001 anthrax attack dies of apparent suicide
In the early days after the letter attacks, in September and October 2001, Dr. Ivins joined about 90 of his colleagues at the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in a round-the-clock laboratory push to test thousands of samples of suspect powder to see if they were anthrax. Later, in April 2002, he came under scrutiny in an Army investigation of a leak of potentially deadly anthrax spores outside a sealed-off lab at Fort Detrick. He later admitted he had discovered the leak but not reported it. A federal law enforcement official said that Dr. Ivins had been regarded as a strong suspect and that agents had been nearing an arrest, and a lawyer familiar with the investigation said he believed that prosecutors had planned to charge only Dr. Ivins. The link between Dr. Ivins’s suicide and the federal investigation was first reported on Friday in The Los Angeles Times. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined on Friday to make public its case against Dr. Ivins, noting that evidence was under court seal as part of a grand jury investigation. Officials said they were briefing the victims of the anthrax letters — those who recovered, as well as family members of those who died — and would need to go to court to have evidence unsealed before it could even be summarized for the public.

Sixteen policemen killed in suspected terrorist attack in Xinjiang, China
・A raid of a border armed police division in Xinjiang Monday morning killed 16 policemen. ・The incident was suspected as a terrorist attack, according to the local police. ・The police said the two attackers had been arrested, and one of them got a leg injury. URUMQI, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) -- Terrorist plot was suspected in the violent attack targeting border police in China's westernmost city of Kashi, which left at least 16 policemen killed and 16 others injured Monday. The attack occurred in the front of the Yiquan Hotel, which is nearly 200 meters away from the Kashi border armed police division, Xinhua correspondent reported from Kashi. The reporter said the police investigation found that two attackers drove a tip lorry to hit a team of policemen who were jogging to pass the hotel in a regular morning exercise at about 8:00 a.m. The suspects then got off the lorry to throw explosive and hack the policemen with knives, after the vehicle veered to knock on a roadside wire pole, said the Kashi police. Fourteen policemen were killed on the spot and two others died on the way to hospital, according to the police source. Xinhua reporter saw blood stain left on the sidewalk, although the accident site had been cleaned by police. The police said the two attackers had been arrested, and one got a leg injury in the raid.

Microsoft study proves six degrees of separation
What are the odds you are connected to an Argentinean folk singer? Or a Turkish Web designer? They're probably better than you think. According to a new study by Microsoft, not only are the odds pretty good, but you can probably be linked to anyone else by fewer than seven acquaintances. The findings throw more science behind the old "small world" theory that all strangers are connected through people they know, popularized by a trivia game about the interconnectedness between the rest of the world and actor Kevin Bacon. "What's the distance between you and any random person on the planet? That's the kind of result we were seeking," Microsoft researcher Eric Horvitz told "Good Morning America." Horvitz and fellow Microsoft researcher Jure Leskovec looked at over 30 billion conversations over Microsoft Messenger in June 2006. "To me, it was pretty shocking," Horvitz told the Washington Post. "What we're seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity. For years now, the "small world" theory found practicality in a trivia game called the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, in which competitors would attempt to connect the actor with other actors using as few links as possible.

Vitamin C can help prevent cancer say the National Institutes of Health
BEIJING, Aug. 5 (Xinhuanet) -- High-dose injections of vitamin C, also known as ascorbate or ascorbic acid, can stop the spread of cancer and slow the growth of tumours by 50 percent in lab mice tests. In a study in Tuesday's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) injected ascorbate into the veins or abdominal cavities of rodents with aggressive brain, ovarian, and pancreatic tumors," delivering "up to four grams per kilogram of body weight daily." The researchers, however, tested the idea that ascorbate, when injected at high doses, may have prooxidant instead of antioxidant activity. Prooxidants would generate free radicals and the formation of hydrogen peroxide, which, the scientists hypothesized, might kill tumor cells. By injecting mice with 43 cancer and five normal cell lines, the researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested, while sparing normal cells. Scientists involved with the study also pointed to evidence that "these high ascorbate concentrations could be achieved in people." Vitamin C, which is found in fruit and vegetables, plays a critical role in health, and a prolonged deficiency leads to scurvy and eventually to death. Vitamin C was considered as a possible treatment for cancer three decades ago, but fell out of favour when studies where the vitamin was given orally failed to live up to expectations. News in Science Injected vitamin C cuts cancer growth Injections of high doses of vitamin C have almost halved the rate of tumour growth in mice, leading US researchers to believe it may be useful in the treatment of cancer in humans.

Mauritania president Abdallahi arrested in coup
Mauritania coup leaders seize President, PM Updated A coup has taken place in the north-west African republic of Mauritania, where the army has seized the President and the Prime Minister after the President sacked several top army officers. A presidency source says soldiers seized President Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, Prime Minister Yahya Ould Ahmed Waghf and the interior minister, and took them to an unknown destination. Troops have also shut down Mauritania's state radio and television, witnesses say. The President's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, has confirmed that presidential guardsmen seized have seized her father. "The security agents of the BASEP (Presidential Security Battalion) came to our home around 9.20 and took away my father," she said. France's foreign ministry says a group of Mauritanian army generals is reported to be holding Mr Waghf. "We are in contact with our embassy to obtain confirmation of the events that appear to be taking place in Nouakchott," a ministry spokesman said. In a decree published earlier on Wednesday by the national news agency, Mr Abdallahi sacked army chief of staff General Mohamed Ould Cheikh Mohamed Ahmed Ghazouani and presidential guard chief Mohamed Ould Abdelaziz. Mr Abdallahi replaced one government in May following criticism over its response to soaring food prices and to attacks over the last year carried out by al Qaeda's north African arm.

Bin Laden's former driver convicted of supporting terrorism
This was the first US war crimes trial since World War II Osama Bin Laden's former driver has been sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison at the first US military trial in Guantanamo Bay. Salim Hamdan was convicted on Wednesday of supporting terrorism, but acquitted of conspiracy to murder. Prosecutors had demanded a sentence of not less than 30 years. On time served Hamdan could be released in five months but the Pentagon has said he will still be retained as an "enemy combatant". The US has always argued it can detain such people indefinitely, as long as its so-called war on terror continues. The Pentagon said Hamdan would serve his sentence and then be eligible for review. Regret The BBC's Kim Ghattas at the trial says the sentence is a dramatic snub to the Bush administration and came after just one-and-a-half hours of deliberation. The jury of six US military officers, not the judge, imposed the sentence under the tribunal rules. "It is my duty as president [of the jury] to inform you that this military commission sentences you to be confined for 66 months," a juror told Hamdan. HAMDAN CHARGES Conspiracy: Not guilty of two counts of conspiring with al-Qaeda to attack civilians, destroy property and commit murder Providing support for terrorism: Guilty on five counts, including being the driver and bodyguard for Osama Bin Laden, a man he knew to be the leader of a terrorist group. Not guilty on three other counts All sides claim victory Profile: Salim Hamdan Timeline: Al-Qaeda Our correspondent says Hamdan looked nervous as he walked in for sentencing but after hearing it, he told jurors: "I would like to apologise one more time to all the members and I would like to thank you for what you have done for me." The judge, Navy Capt Keith Allred, told Hamdan: "I hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country."

Several large explosions reported in Xinjiang, China
(Adds details of injured suspects, background of unrest) By Chris Buckley BEIJING Aug 10 A series of blasts killed at least two people in China's restive far northwest Xinjiang on Sunday, underscoring volatile tensions there two days into the Olympics and less than a week after a blast killed 16 police. The blasts in central Kuqa, a major town in southern Xinjiang more than 3,000 km (1,860 miles) from Beijing, occurred before dawn, Xinhua news agency quoted witnesses as saying. "Casualties of the incident may still rise, Xinhua reported, citing witnesses who "saw flashes of fire and heard sporadic gunshots after the explosions". Four or five suspects were killed or injured in the blasts, Xinhua said, raising the possibility that the two dead were perpetrators. No group has claimed responsibility or been blamed for the blasts, but Chinese officials have said militants seeking an independent homeland for Xinjiang's largely Muslim Uighurs are one of the top security threats to the Beijing Olympics, which started on Friday. "With these special circumstances and the special background of the eve of the Beijing Olympic Games, hostile forces at home and abroad will surely act like cornered mad dogs and step up their terror and sabotage activities," said the governor of Xinjiang, Nuer Baikeli, in the Xinjiang Daily on Friday. Human rights critics and exiled Uighurs say Beijing has exaggerated the threat of violence in Xinjiang and stirred discontent by encouraging the migration of millions of Han Chinese into the region. Kuqa county, where the town of the same name lies, is an ethnically mixed area with a population of some 450,000 that has seen unrest. In April, Xinjiang's hardline Communist Party chief, Wang Lequan, visited Kuqa and told officials "stability comes before all else", according to a report on the Kuqa government website (www.xjkc.gov.cn).

Russia advances into Georgia from Abkhazia
GORI, Georgia Aug 11 At least six Georgian attack helicopters bombed targets in the region around the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali, a Reuters witness said. The action appeared to countermand a Georgian declaration of an end to military activity over the separatist region. The reporter said the helicopters flew from Georgia proper and attacked targets just over the de facto boundary with South Ossetia, sending dark smoke billowing into the air. Russia had earlier accused Georgia of shelling Russian troops, which drove Georgian forces from Tskhinvali this week. TBILISI Aug 10 Russian troops advanced 40 km (25 miles) from separatist Abkhazia to the town of Senaki inside Georgia proper on Monday, the Georgian Interior Ministry said. Senaki lies outside the so-called security zone that runs along the de facto Abkhaz boundary with the rest of Georgia. Russian peacekeepers have been stationed since the territory broke away in the 1990s. "The have advanced in dozens of APCs (armoured personnel carriers) and are now in Senaki," Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili told Reuters. The Russian Defence Ministry said that its operation in Senaki, which sits 30 miles outside the Abkhaz border, was necessary to avert renewed Georgian attacks on South Ossetia. A Georgian Interior Ministry spokesman said that Russian forces had also moved into the town of Zugdidi and seized police stations. The deployments into areas beyond the disputed territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia follow a threat from Moscow that Russian forces would move into the main area of the country if Georgian troops refused to disarm. Control of the highway could cut off the port of Poti on the Black Sea, south of Abkhazia.

The missiles would be similar to those based in Alaska and California Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has said that a preliminary deal allowing the US to site missiles in Poland is aimed against Russia. Poland will host the missiles as part of a defence shield the US says it needs against "rogue states" like Iran. But Mr Medvedev said it demonstrated that Russia's concerns about new systems in eastern Europe were valid. "The deployment of new anti-missile forces has as its aim the Russian Federation," he said. A top general in Moscow said the move would worsen ties with the West already strained by the Georgian conflict. 'Worsen ties' Russia's envoy to Nato has meanwhile been quoted as saying the timing of the deal shows its true purpose is to counter Russia's "strategic potential".

Ceasefire signed in Georgian-Russian conflict
It soon became clear that Russian forces had turned this provision to their advantage as Russian troops, pushed further into Georgia and seized full control of the central city of Gori in recent days.

Only Russian troops performing a true peacekeeping role should remain in the two enclaves, she said.

Iran tries to launch satellite with Safir carrier rocket
Advertisement Iran says it has successfully launched a rocket capable of carrying its first domestically built satellite. Officials said only the rocket had been fired, correcting state media reports that the communications satellite itself had been sent into orbit. The White House voiced concern, saying the technology could also be used for launching weapons. Tehran has pursued a space programme for years, despite international concern over its nuclear plans. In February it sent a probe into space as part of preparations for the launch of the satellite. Long-held ambition Footage aired on Irinn (Islamic Republic of Iran News Network) showed the launch of the Safir rocket in darkness. State and military officials confirmed the launch had taken place. In October 2005 a Russian-made Iranian satellite named Sina-1 was put into orbit by a Russian rocket. White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said: "The Iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions.

Olympic highlights: August 20, 2008
Britain's Olympic medal haul was given a surprise boost after Tasha Danvers produced a superb run to seal a bronze medal in the women's 400m hurdles. The London-born athlete, who has endured an injury-plagued season and almost failed to make the British team, qualified for the world championship final last year but finished last in that race and has never previously threatened the medal placings in major championships. But her time of 53.84sec was enough for third place today, with Jamaica's Melaine Walker taking gold and Sheena Tosta of the USA taking silver. Blonska, 30, failed a test in the early hours after last weekend’s competition and now faces a lifetime ban for what is a second doping offence if she is found guilty by an IOC disciplinary commission which is expected to report its findings today. Sotherton condemned Blonska at last summer’s world championships in Osaka, calling her a cheat and claiming that she should not have been allowed back into the sport after testing positive for the steroid, stanozolol in 2003. On that occasion, Blonska had beaten Sotherton to the silver medal but the Briton’s gain in Beijing will only mean her moving up a place, from fifth to fourth. “I have not seen any of her results since early June and then she comes out here and is producing good performances, which was suspicious. “I hope the Russian and American will be upgraded and get their medals in a proper, official presentation, otherwise they have lost that moment forever. I’m happy I’ve moved up one place but I’m still disappointed with my performance.” If she is found guilty of a doping offence, the immediate punishment for Blonska would be the loss of her medal and expulsion from the Games.

Campaign offices for John McCain evacuated in Centennial, Colorado and Manchester, New Hampshire, USA
DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- Suspicious letters, one containing white powder, received at two of Sen. John McCain's campaign offices were not dangerous, police and fire officials said. Sen. John McCain's camp received two threatening letters, including one that contained white powder. The two letters were sent to a campaign office in suburban Denver and to an office in Manchester, New Hampshire. It was initially reported that the Denver letter contained an unknown white powder and a threatening message, but a fire department spokesman said there was no white powder, just a small amount of an unknown substance. The substance tested positive for protein, the official said. Manchester Police said they examined the letter and found no dangerous substance. The letter drew suspicions because it had a Denver return address, a campaign spokesman said. Four or five people from the office drove themselves to a nearby hospital, said Bruce Williamson of the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office. The people were treated and released after the hospital determined they were not ill. Others in McCain's office were evacuated, Williamson said. Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain smiles during a campaign stop at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan July 18, 2008. The letter arrived in the mail in the afternoon, and the campaign immediately notified local and federal law enforcement authorities, said Jeff Sadosky, a spokesman for the campaign in suburban Washington, D.C. McCain, 71, a Republican senator from Arizona, was taking the day off from the campaign, spending the day at his home in Sedona, Arizona.

US candidate Barack Obama announces Joe Biden as his running mate via text message
His e-mail announcement began: “Friend — I have some important news that I want to make official. I’ve chosen Joe Biden to be my running mate.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The selection was disclosed as Mr. Obama moves into a critical part of his campaign, preparing for the party’s four-day convention in Denver starting on Monday. Mr. Obama’s aides viewed the introduction of his vice presidential choice — including an afternoon rally Saturday at the old State Capitol in Springfield, Ill., the same place where Mr. Obama announced his candidacy on a freezing winter morning almost two years ago — and a tour of swing states as the beginning of a week-long stretch in which Mr. Obama hopes to dominate the stage and position himself for the fall campaign. Word of Mr. Obama’s decision leaked out hours before his campaign had been scheduled to inform supporters via text and e-mail message, and hours after informing two other top contenders for the vice presidential nomination — Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia — that they had not been chosen. As the selection process moved to an end, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, whom Mr. Obama had defeated in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, had slipped out of contention — to the degree that Mr. Obama had never seriously considered her.

Afghan government: More than 90 civilians killed by US airstrike
KABUL, AFGHANISTAN — President Hamid Karzai on Saturday denounced an airstrike by U.S.-led forces that his government said killed 76 Afghan civilians. Civilian casualties are an extremely sensitive subject in Afghanistan, where the government has repeatedly pleaded with Western troops to exercise greater care to avoid injuring and killing noncombatants. The U.S. military initially put the number of dead at 30, describing all of those killed Friday in a remote part of Herat province, on Afghanistan's western border, as Taliban militants. On Saturday, U.S. spokesmen said that five of the dead were believed to be women or children, and that allegations of a much higher and predominantly civilian death toll would be investigated. Accounts of the fighting provided by Afghan authorities, human rights groups and the U.S. military have varied widely, and the remoteness of the area made it difficult to determine exactly what had happened. ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 23 -- U.S. military officials said Saturday that they are investigating allegations by Afghan officials that a U.S.-led bombing raid killed at least 70 civilians in western Afghanistan in the past week. Lt. Col. Rumi Nielson-Green, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military, said 30 Taliban insurgents were killed in the operation, which targeted a compound occupied by a local Taliban commander. "We're confident that we struck the right compound," she said. According to the officials in Herat, the bombing began late Thursday as dozens of villagers in the district of Azizabad gathered for a memorial ceremony for a villager who was killed last year.

US presidential race tied as the Democratic National Convention starts
DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- It's a dead heat in the race for the White House. The first national poll conducted after Barack Obama publicly named Joe Biden as his running mate suggests that the battle for the presidency between the Illinois senator and John McCain is all tied up. In a new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Sunday night, 47 percent of those questioned are backing Obama, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominees, with an equal amount supporting his Republican opponent, McCain. "This looks like a step backward for Obama, who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "Even last week, just before his choice of Joe Biden as his running mate became known, most polls tended to show Obama with a single-digit advantage over McCain." It may be supporters of Hillary Clinton, who still would prefer the New York senator and former first lady as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee. "The number of Clinton Democrats who say they would vote for McCain has gone up 11 points since June, enough to account for most, although not all, of the support McCain has gained in that time," Holland said. Clinton and Obama battled throughout the primary season, with Clinton winning more than 40 percent of the delegates. She suspended her bid for the White House and backed Obama in early June, after the end of primary season.

Oldest Catholic boarding school in Australia at centre of child-sex claims
Bathurst head 'not aware' of current sex abuse Updated The principal of Bathurst's St Stanislaus College says he is not aware of any current paedophile activity at the school. John Edwards says he received information several years ago about alleged sexual misbehaviour at St Stanislaus during the 1980s, and forwarded it to police. In May, police charged a 65-year-old former priest with 33 counts of sexual assault and gross acts of indecency against five boys. Mr Edwards says the allegations are "gravely concerning" and he hopes they are properly dealt with by the courts. "It is absolutely a requirement for this matter to be open, for this matter to be addressed and this matter to be resolved," he said. "This school is very concerned to ensure that children are treated well and that their interests are protected." The commander of the Bathurst-based Chifley Command, Superintendent Michael Goodwin, says the investigation is ongoing. "If there's anyone out there that is currently concerned they may be the subject of this particular investigation they are urged to come forward in the strictest confidence and contact CrimeStoppers," he said. "These allegations happened some 20-odd years ago, there is absolutely no suggestion whatsoever that the college involved is/has been looking to anything in the current day. "I don't know anything about eight alleged other victims, I've not been served with any witness statements so I really can't comment about it," he said.

Barack Obama accepts US presidential nomination from the Democratic Party
(Recasts 1st paragraph; adds details, background) By Steve Gorman LOS ANGELES Aug 29 Over 38 million Americans tuned in for television coverage of Barack Obama accepting the Democratic nomination for U.S. president on Thursday in what is believed to be the most watched convention speech ever. Obama's TV audience, reaching nearly a fourth of all U.S. households, was by far the largest of the four-day Democratic National Convention, surpassing the addresses by his running mate, U.S. Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, and his onetime rival for the nomination, Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York. It also easily eclipsed the acceptance speeches of either of Obama's two immediate Democratic predecessors or the 27.6 million viewers President George W. Bush drew on the fourth night of the Republican National Convention in 2004, when he was nominated for a second term. Obama's historic address, by the first African American chosen to lead a major political party in the race for the White House, averaged 38.4 million U.S. viewers across all major networks, Nielsen Media Research reported on Friday. That figure is the highest for any single night of any major party convention going back to 1996, the last election cycle for which Nielsen keeps night-by-night data. The 1992 conventions as a whole garnered higher household ratings in prime time than this week's Democratic gathering in Denver, meaning a larger percentage of homes were tuned in to those earlier events. The same is true for most conventions held from 1960 to 1984. But because today's household ratings translate into a larger number of individuals based on population growth, Nielsen analyst Anne Elliot said Obama's audience tally is probably the biggest for any televised convention speech in history. Moreover, Nielsen is now including time-shifted viewing by people watching later the same day through digital video recorders -- data not included in previous cycles.

Alaskan governor Sarah Palin chosen by McCain as Vice Presidential running mate
Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate, a decision that guarantees that either an African American or a woman will ascend to the White House for the first time in history next year. The senator from Arizona lived up to his maverick reputation, bypassing former rivals and more experienced governors to choose the little-known Palin, 44, as the person "who can best help me shake up Washington." The self-described "hockey mom" brings a blue-collar conservatism and strong antiabortion views to the ticket and appeals to a party base sometimes suspicious of McCain. She made an immediate pitch to female voters, especially those who had supported Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries, saying that her selection "could help shatter the glass ceiling once and for all." But she is also less than two years into her term as governor, and her only previous political experience came as mayor of the town of Wasilla, which has a population of about 6,700. Democrats immediately seized on her lack of political experience, noting that McCain, who turned 72 on Friday, will be confirmed next week as the oldest first-time presidential nominee in history. After a raucous rally here before what the campaign said were 15,000 supporters -- the largest gathering of McCain's campaign -- the two spent six hours together. They traveled by bus to Pittsburgh, ingratiating themselves to Ohioans as they bought Ohio State Buckeye paraphernalia and stopped for ice cream at a roadside stand. The trip provided valuable bonding time for two people who acknowledge they barely know each other. McCain met Palin at a governor's conference in February, and did not see her again until she secretly flew to Arizona on Wednesday night. After a phone interview with the senator on Sunday night, she arrived in the state three days later for a session with McCain's two top lieutenants. She met with McCain's wife, Cindy, on Thursday morning at the couple's Sedona ranch, then McCain joined them and offered her the job on the deck of the house around 11 a.m. Thursday. While Palin, pronounced PAY-lin, had been mentioned as a dark-horse candidate for the job, she was never described as being on the shortlist under consideration by McCain.

Memorial for toddler who died under care of controversial '1 Mind Ministries' group
They wore all white, refused medical care, referred to themselves with titles such as "Princess" and "Queen," talked to the walls and attempted to banish demons. From the moment that Ria Ramkissoon and her baby boy Javon joined the tiny religious cult, 1 Mind Ministries, in April 2006, her life would change irrevocably. Now, the 21-year-old woman is sitting in the psychiatric unit of a city jail in Baltimore accused by police of slowly starving her son to death and allowing cult members to beat him for disobeying orders such as saying "amen" at meals. After he stopped breathing in his mother's arms, they stuffed Javon's body into a green suitcase, which cult leader "Queen Antoinette" occasionally sprayed with Lysol to cover up the stench, drove to Philadelphia and left the suitcase inside a shed where it sat for a year until police made the gruesome discovery in April, according to a statement of charges. Play In total, five members of the cult, including Ramkissoon, have been charged with murder. Three members -- Queen Antoinette, Trevia Williams and Marcus Cobbs -- are already in jail and federal marshals in the New York area are searching for a fourth member, Steven Bynum. A bail hearing for Ramkissoon, who is charged with first- and second-degree murder, child abuse, assault, reckless endangerment and conspiracy, is set for today. "She sounded like an empty shell," Seeta Khadan-Newton told ABCNews.com. "She sounded like she was going to die. She said she didn't know how this happened, that it wasn't supposed to happen that way… She's not doing well. She had a confrontation with somebody, and she's in the psychiatric ward right now." Khadan-Newton still remembers that fateful day in 2006 when she dropped off her daughter and grandson at a house in West Baltimore, assuming that a babysitter lived there to take care of the boy while Ramkissoon went to school. "They told me not to come back to get her because they would drive her home.

At the least, Republicans close to the campaign said it was increasingly apparent that Ms. Palin had been selected as Mr. McCain’s running mate with more haste than McCain advisers initially described.

Los Angeles commuter train collides with freight train; over two dozen killed
A commuter train engineer who ran a stop signal was blamed Saturday for the nation's deadliest rail disaster in 15 years, a wreck that killed 25 people and left such a mass of smoldering, twisted metal that it took nearly a day to recover all the bodies. A preliminary investigation found that "it was a Metrolink engineer that failed to stop at a red signal and that was the probable cause" of Friday's collision with a freight train in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell said. She said she believes the engineer, whose name was not released, is dead. "When two trains are in the same place at the same time somebody's made a terrible mistake," said Tyrrell, who was shaking and near tears as she spoke with reporters. Authorities later announced that the effort to recover bodies from the Metrolink train's crushed front car had ended, with the death toll at 24. It rose to 25 when a 50-year-old man transported to a hospital from the wreck died. "It was a very, very difficult operation," Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said of the search for bodies.

Russian Boeing 737 crashes with 88 aboard
MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- A passenger jet caught fire early Sunday, exploded and crashed into railway tracks in the central Russian city of Perm, killing all 88 people on board. Wreckage from the Aeroflot-Nord Boeing 737, which crashed near Perm, lies across a railway track. The exact cause of the pre-dawn crash is under investigation, but government spokesman Vladimir Markin said "a technical breakdown" was a likely cause. Markin said in televised remarks that the failure of one of the Boeing 737-500's two engines may have caused the plane to come down, The Associated Press reported. Airline officials have said there is no indication of terrorism. "We think it's very doubtful that it was the result of a terrorist attack, because at the scene, there were no traces of explosives as we know for now," said Lev Koshlyakov, Deputy Director General of Aeroflot. "It slammed in front of my house, and there was a huge flame," an unidentified woman in Perm told Russian state television. She said the impact of the crash "threw me across my sheets....

Royal Society education chief forced out in creation row
Creationism should be included in science lessons to reduce the confusion among the rising numbers of schoolchildren who have been brought up to reject the principles of evolution, one of the country's leading scientists said yesterday. Citing evidence that more than one in 10 children in British state schools now believes in creationism, Professor Michael Reiss, the director of education at the Royal Society, called for such beliefs to be discussed and debated in class by science teachers, but not taught as a subject. The professor, who is also an ordained Church of England clergyman, said the move would help pupils understand that such literal beliefs in religious scripture are not supported by scientific evidence. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the body responsible for the national curriculum, has ruled that discussion of creationism should be omitted from the science curriculum because creationism is "not a scientific theory". But at the British Association's science festival at Liverpool University, Professor Reiss said it was necessary for this to change. "I'm trying to make it less likely that students will ignore science, that they will detach from it, because it makes them feel that they cannot continue with science because it conflicts with their beliefs... But I feel if a science teacher feels comfortable with it then it could reduce confusion." Surveys show that more than 10 per cent of children believe that the Earth is only a few thousand years old rather than the four billion years or so accepted by science. "We have an increasing number of children in schools from Muslim backgrounds and a very high proportion of Muslim families have creationist beliefs," Professor Reiss said. "Secondly, while Christianity as a religion is becoming less important in British society, within Christianity there is quite a high proportion of families that do hold fundamentalist beliefs, and that often means they are creationists." "A better way forward is to say, look, I simply want to present you with the scientific understanding of the history of the universe and how animals and plants and other organisms have evolved."

Russian markets to remain closed until Friday
The Kremlin is in crisis mode, pledging a $20 billion boost Thursday to shore up Russia’s battered markets as it seeks to ward off a financial crash and restore confidence in its fragile banking sector. For a second day, stock markets remained closed after a dizzying plunge in share prices, triggered by a wave of panic selling and margin calls. MICEX, where most trading takes place, fell 25 percent in three days this week and has lost 56 percent since its May peak. The government, which sits on the world’s third-largest financial reserves, has clutched for breathing space by simply halting trading as it debates a raft of measures designed to bring relief to the markets and the banking system — suffering from a lack of liquidity, or ready cash to operate with. It rushed Thursday to introduce measures to ease the burden on the banks. It pledged to lend a further 60 billion rubles ($2.36 billion) to the country’s three largest banks — Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank — in an attempt to filter money down to smaller lenders, who have less ability to access funding. “Everybody’s sitting on a lot of cash, but nobody wants to lend it to anybody else,” said Hawk Sunshine, head of investment banking at Metropol investment bank. “Yes, the Central Bank is giving a ton of money to Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank, but are they going to give it to anybody else? He ordered his government to consider putting up to 500 billion rubles ($20 billion) into the country’s financial markets, a move that provided an immediate boost to Russian shares trading as American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, in London. Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said the government would use the money to buy securities on the stock market if shares remain undervalued for an extended period, the RIA-Novosti news agency reported. “If they simply buy shares in order to dispose of them at a later time ... that would make a lot of sense. The Central Bank said last week it spent a net $5.3 billion from its foreign currency reserves in the first 10 days of September to prop up the ruble — which has plunged as capital is whisked out of the country.

Contaminated baby's milk induces wave of child illness in China
HONG KONG, Sept. 21 (UPI) -- The Chinese tainted milk scandal spread to Hong Kong Sunday, with officials saying a 3-year-old girl had been hospitalized with a kidney stone. Citing unnamed sources, The Daily Telegraph reported Sunday that Hong Kong's Princess Margaret Hospital was treating a girl who regularly drank milk supplied by Yili, one of China's two biggest dairy companies. The British newspaper said Hong Kong officials yanked all Yili products off the shelves last week after some were found to contain the banned additive melamine, sometimes used by farmers and wholesalers to disguise substandard and watered down milk. The Telegraph also said the Dutch firm Friesland Foods, which sells Chinese-supplied milk in Asia under the Dutch Lady label, has recalled its products after a milkshake tested positive for melamine. BEIJING -- Milk came off the shelves in supermarkets, schools and Starbucks outlets across China -- and in markets in Hong Kong and Singapore -- as the scandal that began with poisoned baby formula spread in earnest to milk and other products from some of the country's biggest, most venerable dairy brands. A person close to the situation said China's government is considering a recall of all locally produced dairy goods and could force all companies to reapply for permission to sell their products. BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The number of children sickened by suspected melamine-tainted milk products in China has more than doubled and apparently spread beyond mainland China -- raising fears that the impact of the tainted products could be more widespread that initially thought. China's Health Ministry announced Sunday that 12,892 infants and young children have been sickened by tainted milk powder -- more than double the number previously reported -- according to state-run Xinhua news agency. Of these, 104 have serious symptoms, and 1,579 have been cured and discharged, the agency said. Previously, Chinese officials said more than 6,200 children had been sickened by melamine found in baby formula. In addition, nearly 40,000 other infants and young children have received outpatient medical treatment and consultation as a result of the tainted milk, Xinhua reported on Sunday. Watch CNN visit the company at the center of the scandal » The latest statistics from mainland China come after Hong Kong reported late Saturday that a 3-year-old girl has been sickened by a suspected melamine-tainted milk product -- the first known illness outside of mainland China.

Pakistan says its military fired on U.S. aircraft 'violating' its airspace
Tensions show no sign of abating in the border area Pakistani troops have fired warning shots at two US helicopters forcing them back into Afghanistan, local Pakistani intelligence officials say. The helicopters flew into the tribal North Waziristan region from Afghanistan's Khost province at around midnight, the reports say. Tensions have risen after an increase in US attacks targeting militants. Pakistan's army has said it will defend the country's sovereignty and reserves the right to retaliate to any border violations. The government has said it will take targeted action against the militants, promising raids in some "hotspots" near the border with Afghanistan. Meanwhile in the city of Peshawar, Afghan consul Abdul Khaliq Farahi was kidnapped after six unidentified men ambushed his car, officials say.

FBI begins widespread financial probe of 26 firms
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The FBI is investigating Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers and AIG - and their executives - as part of a broad look into possible mortgage fraud, sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Tuesday. Two officials with knowledge of the FBI investigation into the mortgage crisis said "the investigation is all very preliminary". They said there is a lot of anger and people want someone held accountable. Officials are looking into whether any criminal activity occurred, but the Bureau said the investigation will take some time. They said the investigation is in the preliminary stages, and so far it is a broad look at the companies involved. "From what I've seen so far, I really don't believe we're going to find widespread fraud," according to one of the officials. At this point, the officials said they are not pursuing specific individuals at the four firms under investigation because these firms are facing serious financial problems and they need to find out if it's the result of criminal activity. "Don't expect indictments tomorrow or next week or next month," one of the officials told CNN. FBI spokesman Special Agent Richard Kolko had no comment on that information, but said 26 firms are currently under investigation as part of the bureau's mortgage fraud inquiry. Earlier this month, FBI Director Robert Mueller told Congress that 1,400 individual real estate lenders, brokers and appraisers are now under investigation in addition to two dozen corporations. "As we have seen, this number can fluctuate over time; however we do not discuss which companies may or may not be the subject of an investigation."

McCain delays campaign, Obama says continue the debates
(CNN) -- Presidential candidates Sen. John McCain -- who said Wednesday that he was suspending his campaign because of the nation's economic crisis -- and Sen. Barack Obama will meet Thursday with President Bush to discuss a proposed Wall Street bailout. McCain suspended his campaign, saying it was time for both parties to come together to solve economic crisis. McCain and Obama accepted Bush's invitation to discuss the proposed $700 billion bailout with him and congressional leaders at the White House, the candidates' aides said Wednesday night. Also Wednesday night, McCain and Obama said in a joint statement that the bailout plan was "flawed" but that "the effort to protect the American economy must not fail." "Now is a time to come together -- Democrats and Republicans -- in a spirit of cooperation for the sake of the American people," read the statement, which was released about 15 minutes before Bush made a televised address on the economy. Earlier Wednesday, McCain announced that he would suspend his campaign to go to Washington and participate in negotiations on the bailout plan, and he called for a postponement of Friday's presidential debate. Watch McCain's announcement » His campaign suggested that he would skip the debate if Congress hadn't passed legislation addressing the crisis by then.

Seventh Guantanamo Prosecutor resigns over ethical issues
Guantanamo prosecutor quits The Army reservist was concerned about a lack of due process for war crimes defendant, defense attorneys say. Jawad, now about 23, was arrested in 2002 near Kabul. He is charged with attempting to commit murder in violation of the law of war for allegedly throwing a grenade into a jeep transporting troops, injuring two soldiers and an interpreter. Vandeveld, an Army reservist, said in a four-page declaration filed with the court that "potentially exculpatory evidence has not been provided" to the defense. Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld quit the case -- and the Office of Military Commissions -- after growing increasingly concerned about the lack of due process afforded to Mohammed Jawad and his legal team, according to Michael J. Berrigan, deputy chief defense counsel for the commissions. GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA — Contending that the government had suppressed evidence that could help a young man facing life in prison, a prosecutor has quit the war crimes tribunals here, several military defense lawyers said Wednesday. His Pentagon-appointed defense attorney, Air Force Maj. David Frakt, also said that the prosecutor had quit in recent days over significant concerns about the case. "He was uncomfortable being a prosecutor under the conditions, and [his superiors] told him to do his job," Berrigan said, adding that Vandeveld then took his concerns to higher authorities but was rebuffed. Both defense lawyers said Vandeveld had spelled out his allegations in the sealed affidavit. Vandeveld said in his declaration that prosecutors knew Jawad may have been drugged before the attack and that the Afghan Interior Ministry said two other men had confessed to the same crime. Frakt said he had moved to call Vandeveld as a defense witness; the prosecutor had indicated he would testify about his ethical concerns and about how he wanted to offer Jawad a plea deal that would allow him to walk free in the near future.

VP candidate Palin accuses Obama of terrorist links
US Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin has accused the Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, of associating with terrorists. She said he had been "palling around" with an ex-member of US-based militant group Weather Underground, which opposed the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Mr Obama once served on a charity board with a member of the group, but he has denounced its activities. A Democratic spokesman accused the Republicans of gutter politics. "What's clear is that John McCain and Sarah Palin would rather spend their time tearing down Barack Obama than laying out a plan to build up our economy," Hari Sevugan said. Denunciation Speaking to supporters in Colorado and later in a Los Angeles suburb, Alaska Governor Palin said the time had come to take the gloves off. The White House candidates face their second debate on Tuesday Quoting a New York Times article, she attacked Senator Obama over his link to Bill Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground, which waged a violent campaign against the Vietnam War. The group was blamed for a number of bombings in the US in the 1960s. Mrs Palin described Mr Obama as someone who saw the US "as being so imperfect... he is palling around with terrorists who would target their own country". Mr Obama served on a charity board several years ago with Mr Ayers, who is now a professor at the University of Illinois. Focus on healthcare The Alaska governor also said she wished the McCain campaign had not this week pulled out of the battleground state of Michigan, effectively conceding it to the Democrats.

Thai-Cambodian generals in talks after border clash kills two
The two sides have had troops and equipment in the area since July Generals from Thailand and Cambodia have been holding talks in an attempt to resolve a border dispute that led to a fatal exchange of fire on Wednesday. Reports say both sides have agreed to joint border patrols as a way to ease the tensions. But there are no reports of further progress and Thailand has also implied that Cambodian soldiers have been planting mines in the disputed area. At least two Cambodian troops died in the clash near the Preah Vihear temple. Two Cambodian soldiers were injured, along with seven Thai troops, in the skirmish, which lasted less than an hour. New conflict near ancient ruins In pictures: Thai-Cambodia strife Both countries claim the area around the temple, and despite several rounds of talks a settlement remains elusive. The issue of ownership is partly a nationalist one, but the area is also prized because the temple became a Unesco World Heritage site in June and the site could one day generate lucrative tourist revenues. The UN, US, EU and China have all called for restraint, and Indonesia is said to have offered to mediate in the border talks. Small step "We will introduce the joint patrol to avoid this kind of incident happening again," Lieutenant General Wiboonsak Neeparn, Thailand's north-eastern army commander, was quoted as saying after the five-hour meeting. But he also suggested "not much" progress had been made, pointing out "troops on both sides will stay where they are", a report said. Thailand has also implicitly accused Cambodia of planting further mines in the already heavily mined area, claiming a number of new Russian-made mines have been found buried in the ground and that two Thai soldiers had their legs blown off earlier this month. Meanwhile, there is confusion over the fate of 13 Thai soldiers Cambodia claimed it captured during Wednesday's confrontation.

Police fight police in Brazil protest
Advertisement By Gary Duffy BBC News, Sao Paulo Riot police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo have clashed with other police officers who are on strike. The confrontation happened when the striking officers tried to force their way past barriers to reach a building used by state governor Jose Serra. Tear gas and rubber bullets were used to keep back the demonstrators and 15 to 20 injuries have been reported. Mr Serra later said many protesters had not been police, but members of other unions and political groups. Heated exchanges The clashes happened in the Morumbi district of Sao Paulo as the police officers, who have been on strike for a month, tried to reach the building used by the governor. The strikers wanted to meet him in order to negotiate a 15% pay rise. In a statement, the authorities said the trouble began when strike leaders accepted a proposal to receive an official representative in the area where they were staging the protest. Live television picture showed pushing and shoving and some punches being thrown as the protesters pushed forward. In one incident, a marked police vehicle could be seen trying to force its way through a police cordon, and there were a number of heated exchanges. Hospitals nearby received a small number of people with slight injuries, including a senior officer who had been involved in the negotiations with the protesters. The striking officers are from the branch of the state police responsible for detective work and criminal investigations, while those trying to hold the demonstrators back are from the military police, whose role is broadly to maintain law and order on the streets.

China's Premier recognises government responsibility in milk incident
The contaminated milk killed four babies and left tens of thousands sick Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has said the government is partly responsible for the tainted milk scandal which has left thousands of children sick. In a rare interview with Science magazine, Mr Wen said the government felt "great sorrow" about the crisis, which also killed four children. He said while the problems were with a private company, the government had not properly supervised the dairy industry. Milk powder was contaminated with the industrial chemical, melamine. Suppliers are believed to have added the banned chemical, normally used in plastics, to watered-down milk in order to make it appear higher in protein. Most of the victims were under two-years-old. Firms collapse "We feel great sorrow about the milk incident," Mr Wen was quoted as saying in the magazine, which is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Correspondents say domestic and export markets in products containing Chinese milk powder have stymied, and scores of dairy firms in the country have collapsed. Mr Wen said that clear standards and testing requirements were needed in all the steps of making milk - the production of raw milk, collection, transportation, processing and making formula. "I once again solemnly emphasize that it is absolutely impermissible to sacrifice people's lives and health in exchange for temporary economic development," he said. BEIJING (AP) — In a rare interview with a foreign publication, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China said that the government was partly responsible for the tainted milk scandal that has been blamed in the deaths of at least three babies and has shaken consumer confidence. The government feels “great sorrow” over the crisis that has sickened 53,000 children, Mr. Wen said in an interview on Sept. 20 that was published in last week’s Science magazine.

“I do not see this as the end of the story with Shas,” said Otniel Schneller, a Parliament member from Ms. Livni’s Kadima Party, in a telephone interview, making a point echoed by others. “I think we can still find a creative formula for Jerusalem and bring them back.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Meanwhile Meretz, on the left, has been in talks all week with Ms. Livni. “We decided that we are in the government and now are setting about writing the agreement,” Avshalom Vilan, a Parliament member from Meretz, said by telephone. “I believe Livni will try to build a government with what she has rather than go to early elections.” So far, Ms. Livni has a clear deal only with the Labor Party, led by Defense Minister Ehud Barak. Mr. Barak wants as broad a government as possible because he worries that a narrow one will not last and will lead inevitably to early elections in which the opposition Likud Party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, is ahead in the polls. An associate of Mr. Barak said he would be willing to move forward if both Meretz and Yahadut Hatorah signed on, bringing her governing majority to 66.

Asian stock markets slide; Nikkei at lowest level since '82
Nikkei dives to 26-year low Posted Japan's main stock index hit its lowest level in 26 years in early trading today as the global economic crisis continued to batter markets. The Nikkei index has tracked share prices in Japan since the 1940s and heavy falls last week saw it touch its lowest in five years. Shortly after opening this morning the index plunged below 7,500, a level not seen since 1982. Japanese companies are being marked down because of the impact a slowing global economy will have on their earnings, and also the rapidly strengthening yen, which has reached a 13-year-high against the US dollar. The Nikkei's all-time high was set in 1989, when it reached 38,915 points - more than four times its current level - at the height of Japan's so-called "bubble economy". A staff at Tokyo Stock Exchange looks at a stock quotation board as he works at the bourse in Tokyo October 27, 2008. REUTERS/Issei Kato TOKYO Japan's Nikkei average slid 6.4 percent on Monday to its lowest close in 26 years, as the yen rose to batter exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and banks tumbled on concerns they would need to beef up capital. Gains in the yen came despite a G7 warning about excessive volatility in the currency -- a warning that the Japanese government had requested. Pledges from Prime Minister Taro Aso for more steps to ease the strains on banks and strengthen rules on short-selling did little to ease the panic in the markets. "We need something that surprises the market in a good way, perhaps something like the government intervening to sell yen," said Masayoshi Okamoto, head of dealing at Jujiya Securities. "If we don't have something like this, today's low -- the 26-year low -- won't be significant at all." In its fourth straight negative day, the Nikkei .N225 shed 486.18 points to close at 7,162.90, its lowest close since October 1982 -- when Ronald Reagan was the U.S. President and Sony Corp released the CD player.

Syria files UN Security Council complaint after US raid
Syria hardened its stance against the U.S. on Wednesday, threatening to cut off cooperation on Iraqi border security while demanding America apologize and promise not to repeat a deadly cross-border raid into its territory. The U.S. Embassy announced that it was closing its doors on Thursday "due to security concerns." The statement on its Web site did not say for how long. The closure announcement came ahead of a government-sanctioned mass demonstration set for Thursday in Damascus to protest Sunday's raid that Syria said killed eight people in the eastern border community of Abu Kamal. The Syrian government already had ordered the closure of an American school and cultural center. That and a U.S. embassy warning to be vigilant has raised concerns among Americans living in Damascus. According to a State Department official, America's senior diplomat in the country, Maura Connolly, was officially notified of Syria's request that the American Cultural Center be closed effective immediately. "We are looking at how to respond," State Department deputy spokesman Robert Wood said, adding that in the meantime: "we expect the Syrian government to provide adequate security for the buildings in which the American Cultural Center and Damascus Community School are housed." "We ask of them (Iraqis) and the Americans to investigate and provide us with the background for such a criminal, terrorist act against an independent state ... (and) make an official apology for this aggression and pledge not to repeat it," Mekdad told The Associated Press. "What is required of the American government is to confess to this aggression and not be cowardly," he said, adding that the U.S. should also compensate Syria.

David Tennant announces exit from Doctor Who
David Tennant, one of the most popular time lords ever to step into the Tardis, said last night he would leave the BBC's Doctor Who series at the end of next year. Tennant's decision will bring to an end his four-year tenure as the 10th Doctor, which has seen him win over a new generation of fans and amass an enviable collection of television awards. Tennant, 37, made his announcement by videolink at last night's National Television awards, where he won an outstanding drama performance award and Doctor Who also won most popular drama. The BBC said he would play the Doctor in the four specials due to screen as part of the 2009 series before a new time lord "regenerates" for the 2010 series. The Scottish actor first expressed interest in fulfilling his childhood dream to play the Doctor for the 2005 series, but the role went to Christopher Eccleston. But the following season, the BBC confirmed Tennant would take up the battle against the Zygons and Daleks. Tennant's charisma as the Doctor has elevated his status to one of the most popular actors on British television, with the actor picking up the National Television award's most popular actor award last year and best actor in 2006. On announcing his departure last night, Tennant said: "It would be very easy to cling on to the Tardis console forever and I fear that if I don't take a deep breath and make the decision to move on now, then I simply never will. You would be prising the Tardis key out of my cold dead hand." It would be very easy to cling on to the Tardis console forever and I fear that if I don't take a deep breath and make the decision to move on now, then I simply never will...

Christian Science Monitor to cease daily print publication
Its readers are a snapshot of a bygone age – retired diplomats, missionaries and maiden aunts – but The Christian Science Monitor has plans that many a forward-looking editor would blanche to think of. In April, the US daily will ditch its paper edition and channel resources into its website, with a daily email bulletin and weekly 44-page magazine for subscribers. Moving from print to online is hardly a novelty: for many struggling publications it's the elephant in the newsroom as circulation dwindles and print costs soar. But the Monitor will be the first nationally circulated daily paper to surrender its print version altogether and, according to its editor, John Yemma, it will not be the last. "We've always been burdened by the unwieldy mechanism of publishing and distributing a daily paper simultaneously across America," he says. Later this month, The Christian Science Monitor marks its 100th birthday, but you would be forgiven for never having heard of it. Mary Eddy was "aghast" as the quality of journalism, says Yemma, and with the Monitor she tapped into a surge of Puritanism which, with the help of church funds, allowed the paper to flourish. As a news-gathering organ, the paper is blessed with enviable resources, including an astonishing 95 full-time editorial staff, with correspondents all over America and in seven bureaux worldwide.

US voters go to the polls
An unprecedented outpouring of voters translated into waits of several hours yesterday at polling sites from Arizona to southeastern Virginia, amid sporadic reports around the country of problematic voting machines, faulty registration lists, and deceptive text messages and other high-tech efforts to deter young people and minorities from casting ballots. In fact, the record-shattering turnouts transformed the protracted waits in some places into de facto street parties, with citizens snapping photos with their cellphones as they waited their turn at democracy's most basic task. In Santa Monica, Calif., crowds in line at 7 a.m. for the polls to open at City Hall broke into cheers and songs as the sun rose. The day had its share of snags. One Kansas City, Mo., ward received scrambled registration lists, prompting huge backups, for two hours until the rolls were straightened out, as poll workers verified eligibility. A suspicious white powder closed one Rhode Island polling station for four hours until officials determined the substance to be soap. Polls in at least a few places remained open later than scheduled to accommodate the throngs or for other reasons. They included Seattle and Tacoma, Wash., and a few precincts close to universities in Florida and Virginia. "From the national view, we just haven't had the kind of breakdowns people feared," said Doug Chapin, director of Electionline.org, a nonpartisan project that monitors election administration.

While campaigning, Barack Obama said he could hold direct talks with Tehran[AFP] While campaigning, Barack Obama said he could hold direct talks with Tehran[AFP] Diplomatic ties between the two countries have largely been cut since the revolution removed the country's US-backed leader from power. During campaigning, Obama said if elected, he would consider holding direct talks with Iranian leaders over the country's nuclear programme, which Western powers have alleged is for developing weapons. 'War-oriented' policies Ahmadinejad said in the statement published by Irna, Iran's official news agency, that he hoped Obama would put an end to the United States' "war-oriented" policies. "Other nations expect war-oriented policies, occupation, bullying ... and imposing discriminatory policies on them to be replaced by those advocating respect ... and non-interference in other countries' state matters," he said. Obama has said he would be willing to toughen sanctions on Iran, and like George Bush, the current president, would not rule out military action against Tehran. Obama has said direct talks could be necessary to give those decisions greater credibility and criticised the outgoing administration for not pushing for more diplomacy and engagement with Tehran. On Thursday, the Bush administration further restricted Iran's access to the US financial system by banning certain types of fund transfers, the US treasury department said. Speaking to Mehr news agency, he said that "through the lifting of the past government's cruel sanctions against Iran, Barack Obama can demonstrate his goodwill to the Iranian people". Israeli caution The UN has imposed three rounds of sanctions since 2006, in addition to bilateral measures by Washington, over Iran's refusal to halt uranium enrichment - a process that can have either civilian or military uses.

Gay marriage banned in three states; other ballot measures decided
As the world focused on the presidential election, voters in a number of US states decided questions on a hot-button social and cultural issues. Voters in Colorado and South Dakota defeated ballot measures aimed at restricting abortion, while Massachusetts and Michigan approved measures to slacken marijuana laws. In Washington state, voters approved a law allowing physician-assisted suicide. In South Dakota, voters rejected a ballot proposition that would have outlawed abortion except in cases of rape, incest and serious health threat to the mother. Had it passed, the law would likely have provoked a constitutional challenge, setting up an fight in the US supreme court over a woman's right to choose abortion. In 2006 South Dakotans rejected a stricter abortion ban that did not include the exceptions for rape and incest. It doesn't mention abortion, but would force legislators and courts to confront which legal rights to extend to foetuses – and whether the amendment effectively bans abortion. Michigan became the 13th state to legalise marijuana for medical use, while Massachusetts decriminalised possession of one ounce or less of the substance, making the offence punishable with a citation and a $100 fine. "Tonight's results represent a sea change," said Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, which backed the Massachusetts and Michigan ballot proposals. "Voters have spectacularly rejected eight years of the most intense government war on marijuana since the days of 'Reefer Madness.'" In Arkansas, voters approved a measure on the ballot to bar unmarried couples from adopting or taking in foster children.

Of the 20-member cabinet, six are women, one is a first-time MP and six have less than three years' experience. A second surprise was the award of the big-budget social development portfolio to Paula Bennett, who only became an MP in 2005. Mr Key, a multi-millionaire former investment banker, has worked fast to form a government ahead of being signed in on Wednesday so he can leave for a summit in Peru the next day. Economic challenge "The National-led government takes office at a challenging time for the country," Mr Key said after announcing his line-up. "The growth outlook is weak, and international and domestic difficulties abound. "This government will concentrate on boosting economic growth because that is what will lead us out of these challenging times," he said.

Calgary Stampeders win 2008 Grey Cup in Montreal
Tailback Avon Cobourne scored Montreal's only touchdown and Damon Duval booted two field goals and a single as the Alouettes lost for the fifth time in six Grey Cup appearances since 2000. They failed in a bid to become the first team to win a Grey Cup on home turf since the B.C. I know the difference between reality and playing a game, that's why I kept everything in perspective.

Multiple extremist attacks in Mumbai, India kill dozens, injure hundreds
NEW DELHI An organisation calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen has claimed it was behind attacks in India's financial capital Mumbai that have left at least 80 people dead, television channels reported on Thursday. The previously unknown or little known group sent an email to news organisations claiming responsibility. India has suffered a wave of bomb attacks in recent years. Most have been blamed on Islamist militants, although police have also arrested suspected Hindu extremists thought to be behind some of the attacks. Employees and guests of the Taj Mahal Palace hotel are rescued by fire crews Gunmen have carried out a series of co-ordinated attacks across the Indian city of Mumbai (Bombay), killing 101 people and injuring 287 more. Attacks leave India reeling Witnesses tell of violence In pictures: Mumbai attacks As day broke in Mumbai, the situation on the ground was still confused with reports of gunfire and explosions at between seven and 16 locations. The city's main commuter train station, a hospital, a restaurant and two hotels - locations used by foreigners as well as local businessmen and leaders - were among those places caught up in the violence. In other developments: • Fire crews evacuate people from the upper floors of the Taj Mahal Palace, where police say a grenade attack caused a blaze • The head of Mumbai's anti-terrorism unit and two other senior officers are among those killed, officials say • The White House holds a meeting of top intelligence and counter-terrorism officials, and pledges to help the Indian government • Trading on India's Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange markets will remain closed on Thursday, officials say.

India's Home Minister quits as first political fallout of Mumbai attacks
Chidambaram takes over as home minister Text Size: |  63-year-old Chidambaram, who has had a stint as minister of internal security under the late Rajiv Gandhi in late 1980s, was shifted to the home ministry after amidst demands for the ouster of Patil, who had come under severe attack for his handling of internal security matters. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, himself an economist of repute, will hold the finance portfolio at a time when the country is suffering from the ripple effects of the global recession. Singh had held the finance portfolio for five years under the late P V Narasimha Rao. A Rashtrapati Bhawan communique announced the appointment of Chidambaram as home minister after acceptance of Patil's resignation. Indications that Chidambaram would be given the new responsibility came when he was called as a special invitee to the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday night and he met the Prime Minister on Sunday morning to discuss the situation arising out of the Mumbai terror attacks. After recommending Patil's resignation to President Pratibha Patil, who is away in Indonesia, the Prime Minister spoke to Chidambaram formally conveying the decision to give him the new assignment. The appointment also came hours before the start of the all-party meeting convened by the Prime Minister to discuss the Mumbai attacks and evolve a consensus on how to combat terror. Shortly after his appointment, home secretary Madhukar Gupta gave him a briefing on the ministry, especially in the current context of tackling the menace of terrorism. A Harvard-educated MBA and an eminent lawyer, Chidambaram brings to home ministry his vast experience as a political administrator he had gained during his various stints in the government at the Centre.

Hillary Clinton nominated as US Secretary of State
Enlarge By Charles Dharapak, AP Barack Obama leaves a news conference in Chicago with Secretary of State-designate Hillary Rodham Clinton. They are followed by members of his newly-named security team, from top left: Eric Holder, Janet Napolitano, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Vice President-elect Joe Biden and James Jones. CHICAGO  President-elect Barack Obama promised "a new dawn of American leadership" in the world Monday from a diverse national security team that has not always agreed with him. The team, led by his former campaign rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and President Bush's Defense secretary, Robert Gates, is charged with reinvigorating diplomacy, using power pragmatically and renewing what Clinton called "America's standing in the world as a force for positive change." HOLDER: Historic pick for A.G. faces challenges NAPOLITANO: Tasked with Homeland Security overhaul JONES: Not regarded as 'political general' SUSAN RICE: U.N. ambassador to mend fences Also nominated for top jobs were Eric Holder as attorney general, Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano as Homeland Security secretary, retired Marine general Jim Jones as national security adviser and Susan Rice as U.N. ambassador. "America's security is not a partisan issue — witness the team," Vice President-elect Joe Biden said. "I'm a strong believer in strong personalities and strong opinions. "I'm going to be welcoming a vigorous debate inside the White House." Michael O'Hanlon, senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said keeping Gates is "a fairly clear indication from Obama that he's going to be flexible on Iraq." Foreign policy experts said the group will differ more in style than substance from the moderate team, led by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, that Bush installed halfway through his presidency.

(Xinhua/AFP Photo) Photo Gallery>>> "The Aquiles is sailing with all the passengers to the Chilean Crei Base," which is located 350 km from the accident place, the Argentine navy said in a statement. Aquiles is expected to arrive the Chilean base early Saturday, where the passengers will be taken by a Hercules C-130 plane of the Argentine Air Force to the Port of Ushuaia in southern Argentina. The cruise ship has a Panamanian flag but is owned by an Argentine company. It sent out alarms midday Thursday after it started leaking fuel and taking in water.

Irish government orders recall of all pork products
Irish pork products on sale since September 2008 were recalled last night following fears that pigs had been given feed contaminated by harmful toxins. The Food Standards Agency of Ireland revealed pork products on several farms across the country were found to have up to 200 times more dioxins than the accepted safe limit. The recall affects products sold across Ireland and the UK since 1 September. Consumers and retailers are now being encouraged to destroy all Irish pork and bacon products bought since that date. The FSAI admitted suspicions over contamination were first raised last Monday, as a result of routine testing of pigs, when restrictions were placed on some pig farms. But the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was only confirmed yesterday by tests from a UK laboratory. The contamination has been traced back to an ingredient in an animal feed from one supplier, which was used at 47 different farms. They include 37 beef farms, but it has not yet been necessary to withdraw the beef products. Chronic long-term exposure to the dioxin can have serious health effects, including causing cancers, but the FSAI said the recall will ensure consumers only had minimum exposure to it. The UK's Food Standards Agency has said pork from the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland should not be eaten.

Alleged 9-11 conspirators will confess and plead guilty
The Nation Chaos at Guantanamo tribunal Five alleged Sept. 11 plotters offer to plead guilty, then three decline. But given the chance to enter pleas later in the day, Mohammed and two others declined because they were concerned that pleading guilty without a military jury present might make them ineligible for a sentence of death. Mohammed mocked the tribunal for its bureaucracy and dismissed his Navy lawyer for having served in Iraq, where U.S. troops have been "killing our brothers and sisters." Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and his alleged co-conspirators renewed their vows to die as martyrs at the hands of the U.S. military, offering to plead guilty and dispense with pretrial matters to hasten their execution. GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA — Five men accused of plotting the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks turned what might have been their last appearance before a Guantanamo court Monday into a tribute to Osama bin Laden and a call on fellow holy warriors to strike the U.S. with weapons of mass destruction. The judge newly assigned to the Sept. 11 defendants' case, Army Col. Stephen R. Henley, asked government lawyers whether rules for the military commissions, as the trials are known, allowed him to find the men guilty. The law enacted by Congress two years ago calls for a military jury of at least 12 members to sentence a defendant to death. No jury has been assembled because the court had expected to address only pretrial issues this week. The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Army Col. Lawrence J. Morris, said the confusion about the death penalty arose because the Uniformed Code of Military Justice that governs military courts-martial prohibits guilty pleas in capital cases to protect defendants from being railroaded to execution. Henley also declined to allow two of the men, Ramzi Binalshibh and Mustafa Ahmed Hawsawi, to represent themselves until the court reviews their psychiatric evaluations. Upon learning that they wouldn't be allowed to enter their pleas together, the five said they would wait until they could stick with their strategy of united action. In a dramatic finale to a day in court that was watched by nine people who lost loved ones in the attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon, Binalshibh proclaimed the defendants' allegiance to Bin Laden and his international jihad against the U.S. "I want to send my greetings to Osama bin Laden, and I want to reaffirm my allegiance.

23 Australians arrested in global child porn network
More child porn arrests expected: AFP Updated Australian Federal Police (AFP) say they expect to make more arrests in relation to an alleged internet child sex abuse network. Police have charged 22 men from three states after a 12-month investigation, and the AFP has seized more than 500,000 images and 15,000 videos as part of their inquiries. Twenty-eight search warrants were carried out and the suspects include seven people from Victoria; nine from New South Wales; and five from Queensland. One of those arrested was a 74-year-old retired Victorian Queen's Counsel from Newham, several child care workers and a police officer. Police say the investigation started in December after a tip off from Brazillian police. "Over 200 suspects have been identified across a number of countries, over 70 countries and I think on any scale that's a good result," he said. "We are finding with these type of images that it is very difficult for law enforcement to track them down but we are receiving information that they are based primarily in eastern Europe and North and South America." "We, through our international liaison network, received information from the Brazilian police that there was a large amount of males throughout the world in over 70 countries involved in the trading of this sort of information in a peer to peer network," he said. "They passed the information on to the AFP and we then conducted significant inquiries with internet service providers and then moved forward."

Human remains in mass grave confirm Argentina secret death camp
By Daniel Schweimler BBC News, Buenos Aires The remains of hundreds of people killed during Argentina's military dictatorship about 30 years ago have been found in a pit. The thousands of bone fragments were found at a former detention centre. Investigators say the discovery proves that the authorities tortured, killed and burned the bodies of their political opponents. Human rights groups and survivors have made such allegations but the military deny them. The official figures say that 13,000 people were killed under military rule in Argentina in the late 1970s and and early 1980s. But the families, survivors and human rights campaigners say many more - up to 30,000 - were kidnapped by the authorities and taken in unmarked cars to clandestine detention centres. 'The disappeared' But many of the bodies have never been found and the authorities eliminated all record of their grisly actions. These victims became known as "the disappeared". But the families and forensic investigators have never given up their search for truth and justice. And this find - 10,000 human bone fragments at a former detention centre in the city of La Plata, just south of Buenos Aires - they say confirms what they have always said. They are still working on the bones, but say the evidence uncovered so far shows that the bodies were thrown into the pit, covered in fuel then set alight alongside tyres to cover the smell of burning flesh. Civilian governments in the 1980s and 1990s pardoned many of the perpetrators of what became known as the Dirty War. But the trials resumed a couple of years ago and a small number of minor officials have been prosecuted and sent to jail.

Thai opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva elected as new Prime Minister
Advertisement Thailand's opposition leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva, has been confirmed as the country's new prime minister after winning a special vote in parliament. The speaker of the lower house, Chai Chidchob, said the Democrat Party leader had beaten former police chief Pracha Promnok by 235 votes to 198. The previous prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, was forced to resign after a court ruling earlier this month. ABHISIT VEJJAJIVA Born in Britain, educated at Eton and Oxford Entered parliament in 1992 as one of its youngest members Party leader since 2005 Opposed military coup that overthrew Thaksin Shinawatra Profile: Abhisit Vejjajiva Mountain to climb for new PM Send us your comments The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says Mr Abhisit will start his term in office confronting some formidable challenges. The 44-year-old British-born politician needs to restore battered economic confidence, cool the emotional political climate, and impose his authority on a cabinet drawn up as a result of days of bargaining with his coalition partners, our correspondent says. 'Silent coup' After the speaker of parliament had gone round and asked each of the 436 MPs to state the choice, he announced that Mr Abhisit had won and that the Democrats would be given their first chance to govern for eight years. "Abhisit gained more than half of the vote, therefore I declare that Abhisit has been elected the new prime minister," Mr Chai said. Advertisement However, correspondents say the new coalition may only last a few weeks, as by-elections will be held on 11 January to fill 29 seats held by Thaksin supporters barred from politics by the court ruling. There are also questions about the nature of the behind-the-scenes bargaining needed to persuade Thaksin loyalists to switch sides, with lucrative cabinet posts and, allegedly, large sums of cash being offered by both sides. Outside the parliament, about 200 supporters of the ousted government reacted furiously to what they called a "silent coup", hurling barricades at the gates and stopping MPs from leaving.

Ferry sinks in northern Philippines, 28 dead
The wooden-hulled ferry, Maejan, was approaching its destination in Aparri town in Cagayan province after an eight-hour journey from Calayan islands in the Luzon Strait when it overturned near the mouth of the Cagayan River on Sunday evening, said Senior Inspector Alex de los Santos. He said passengers jumped into the cold water after strong waves broke the ferry's bamboo outrigger, causing it to bob wildly. "They panicked and grabbed anything like water containers that will keep them afloat then jumped off the boat," de los Santos told The Associated Press by telephone. He said most of the 46 survivors swam to shore in Aparri, about half a mile (kilometer) away, where police and villagers found them shivering close to midnight. The dead — including a 1-year-old boy and a town councillor — were taken to funeral parlors, where relatives gathered to identify them. Most probably his parents perished with him." De los Santos said coast guard and navy vessels joined the search for 33 people still missing, but bad weather was hampering the effort. Coast guard chief Vice Adm. Wilfredo Tamayo said criminal charges will be filed against the owner and surviving crew members of the 28-ton Maejan, which was authorized to carry only 50 people. Hours before the ferry capsized, three children fell into the sea as the vessel was lashed by huge waves, Calayan Mayor Joseph Llopis said. Two of the children were plucked alive, but it was not clear if they survived the final capsizing, said Llopis, who lost 10 of his relatives in the disaster. The accident was especially tragic because many of the passengers from his town of 17,000 people were traveling to Aparri to buy food and other goods ahead of Christmas, Llopis said.

Cleveland, Ohio clinic performs US's first face transplant
Surgeons discuss landmark face transplant In a Wednesday news conference, the Cleveland Clinic doctors who conducted the world's most extensive facial transplant described the 22-hour surgery they said took place at the clinic within the last two weeks. The patient is doing well, they said. Then she headed to the hospital to give a woman who had no upper jaw, nose, cheeks or lower eyelids -- who was unable to eat, talk, smile, smell or breathe on her own -- a new face. "We have a donor," she told Dr. Frank Papay, the chief of dermatology and plastic surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, late one night. Dr. Maria Siemionow had been preparing for 20 years to make the phone call. It was the first facial transplant to be done in the U.S. and the fourth in the world. At the patient's request, the clinic did not release her name, age or details about what caused her disfigurement -- only that it was severe. "It became very difficult for her just to go outside of her house." The day after Siemionow's phone call unfolded like the countdown to a rocket launch, Papay said. First came the wait while the laboratory determined that the deceased donor matched the patient's blood type, gender, race and approximate age. One group began removing the donor's facial skin; all of the muscles in the mid-face; the upper lip; all of the nose; most of the sinuses around the nose; the upper jaw, including some teeth; and the facial nerve.

Hamas ends truce with Israel
The six-month truce between Hamas and Israel ended yesterday with the militant Islamists who rule Gaza declaring the agreement dead, 24 hours before it was due to officially expire. The declaration followed another day of escalating violence, beginning with an Israeli air raid on Gaza, which Hamas has controlled for the past 18 months. Hamas responded to Israel's attack, which destroyed a weapons store and a rocket factory, by firing eight rockets and five mortars at Israel's southern towns. "The calm, which was reached with Egyptian sponsorship on 19 June and expires on 19 December, is finished because the enemy did not abide by its obligations," said Ayman Taha, who represented Hamas in talks with other Palestinian factions. The truce was due to end today but has been unravelling ever since Israel crossed into Gaza, killed six Hamas fighters and destroyed a tunnel on 4 November. So far this week Hamas has fired around 50 rockets. On Wednesday one struck a parking lot near a supermarket in Sderot, the Israeli town that borders Gaza's northern perimeter and bears the brunt of Palestinian missile attacks. As the fighting escalated, Israel tightened its blockade, forcing the UN Relief and Works Agency, which feeds 750,000 Palestinian refugees in the coastal territory, to suspend food deliveries yesterday. The eruption of violence follows five months of relative calm in which each side seemed prepared to turn a blind eye to the other's transgressions: Israel maintained its crippling blockade on Gaza and Palestinian militants continued firing a small number of missiles into neighbouring Israeli townships. Although publicly neither side is rushing in, both have an interest in restoring the quiet. For Israel, the truce not only gave the residents of towns such as Sderot a reprieve, it deflated the hard right's push for a full-scale invasion into Gaza.

Four UK retailers call in administrators during the week of Christmas
It has been a tough few months for well-known retailers UK menswear retailer The Officers Club has gone into administration and 32 of its 150 shops will shut immediately, while the remainder have been sold. The retailer was put up for sale by administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers as it fell victim to the downturn. They said the 118 stores had been sold to TimeC 1215 limited, which is backed by David Charlton, chief executive of The Officers Club. He said the deal would protect the jobs of 900 people. It became one of the biggest retail companies in the UK with flagship stores in London's Oxford Street and north-east England. 'Employment protected' "We are very pleased to be able to secure this deal and protect the employment of over 900 people in the stores and head office," said Mr Charlton. "We welcome the opportunity to take the business forward and look forward to a successful future." Insolvency experts are warning that more than 10 national or regional retail chains risk going bust next month. Retailers are vulnerable in January because they generally have more cash and less stock than at any other time of the year, so if creditors are going to force them into administration it is the best time to do so. It has already been a tough few months for well-known retailers, with MFI already having closed down and Woolworths due to shut its shops in January.

Nine dead after armed Santa Claus opens fire in LA suburb
The Ortega home, a tidy, one-story structure at the end of a Covina cul-de-sac, had been at the center of so many family events: pizza nights, poker parties and an annual Christmas Eve party where the large, close-knit family gathered to celebrate the holidays. On Saturday, it was a place for grief. Leaning toward the yellow police tape that encircled the ruins of the home, family members wrapped their arms around each other. They gestured at items that had been salvaged and laid on the front lawn: a file cabinet, charred photo albums and singed pictures. FOR THE RECORD: Holiday massacre: An article in Sunday's California section said that the home of the Ortega family, nine of whom were believed slain by Bruce Jeffrey Pardo on Christmas Eve, was a single-story structure. —  Three days earlier, the ex-husband of one of the Ortegas arrived at their holiday celebration dressed as Santa Claus and armed with four semiautomatic weapons and an incendiary device. When he left, nine family members were dead and the house was engulfed in flames. Members of the Ortega family declined to speak to the media Saturday. But friends and neighbors described them as a family that reveled in togetherness. "If you were a friend of any of them, you were a friend to all of them," said Linda Perez, who has known the Ortegas for eight years. The idyllic togetherness was shattered Wednesday night by Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, who later drove to his brother's house in Sylmar, booby-trapped his rental car and killed himself.

Belgian king swears in PM Van Rompuy, cabinet
BRUSSELS Dec 31 New Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy urged parliament on Wednesday to pass bills to revive an economy heading into recession and to resolve a political dispute that threatens to pull the country apart. "The year that ends today has been marked by the most serious global financial crisis since the 1930s," he said in a declaration before a vote of confidence due on Friday. "Domestically it has been a year of uncertainty, partly due to political moments of crisis and the consequences of the financial crisis," he continued in the Belgian equivalent of a state of the union address. Van Rompuy, 61, became Belgium's third premier in a year on Tuesday, succeeding Yves Leterme whose government collapsed on Dec. 19 over the stalled bailout of stricken bank Fortis FOR.BR and asset sale to France's BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA). Belgium is expected to have entered a recession in the fourth quarter, faces a lingering bank crisis and is beset by a dispute over devolution that has seen it lurch from one political crisis to another since the June 2007 election. Leterme's government proposed earlier this month pumping 2 billion euros ($2.84 billion) into the economy next year, part of a 200 billion euro EU-wide stimulus package. It must be enacted as soon as possible," Van Rompuy told lawmakers. "It is clear that in the coming weeks and months the government will take new initiatives to cope with the challenges that the crisis poses for the economy and employment." Van Rompuy also pressed bickering parties to settle a dispute over whether the regions should have greater autonomy. The majority Dutch-speakers want more powers for Flanders over the labour market and justice, but French-speakers fear further devolution will hit their less vibrant economy and risks breaking the 178-year-old country in two.

New Year fire kills at least 59, injures 212 more at Bangkok pub
Advertisement Police are investigating the cause of a fire in a Bangkok nightclub that killed 59 people, amid reports that fireworks were to blame. More than 200 people, including at least four Britons, were injured in the fire at the Santika club. Survivors have accused the venue of ignoring basic safety rules. Customers were reportedly allowed to detonate firecrackers inside the club, which lacked a fire exit and had bars on the windows. The police say there are no grounds yet for charging the owners of the club, but an investigation into the causes of the fire will be completed within two to three weeks. Safety concerns Only a full investigation can give a definitive answer as to whether the Santika was unsafe, the BBC's Jonathan Head reports from Thailand. But already there is enough circumstantial evidence from the accounts of survivors to conclude that the club probably failed to meet the most basic safety standards, he says. The management allowed fireworks to be lit inside a building packed with up to 1,000 revellers. Material that ignited in the ceiling - possibly soundproofing - flared into an inferno in just a few minutes and produced toxic fumes which killed many of the victims. There was no emergency lighting, so people had to find their way out in pitch darkness. The venue was not even registered as a nightclub - a situation which our correspondent says is not uncommon in Thailand.

Sri Lanka Army captures Tamil Tiger's capital of Kilinochchi
COLOMBO Sri Lankan jets and attack helicopters bombed Tamil Tiger positions in the north of the island on Saturday, the military said, a day after ground forces seized the rebels' de facto capital Kilinochchi. The military is now targeting the port town of Mullaitivu and other rebel strongholds in the north, as it seeks to deliver a knockout blow to end the island's 25-year separatist war in which more than 70,000 people have been killed. At least three people were injured and several vehicles damaged in an explosion on Saturday in the commercial quarter of Colombo, the second in the capital in two days. "A small IED (Improvised Explosive Device) fixed underneath of a van exploded and three people injured," Nanayakkara said. There has been no direct comment from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on the fall of Kilinochchi, long the centre of the rebels fight for an independent homeland for the Tamil minority. "Fighter Jets raided a Sea Tiger base in Mullaitivu while the MI-24 helicopters attacked rebel positions in and around Mullaitivu in support of ground troops," Air Force spokesman Wing Commander Janaka Nanayakkara said. Details of casualties from the fighting have not yet emerged and a pro-rebel web site www.tamilnet.com said the Tigers had moved their headquarters further northeast before the town fell. "The Sri Lanka Army (SLA) has entered a virtual ghost town," the website said. Nanayakkara said troops were carrying out search and recovery operations in Kilinochchi town on Saturday. Defence Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said the troops were 2 km from Elephant Pass, a key rebel position in the neck of the northern Jaffna peninsula, and 6 km from Mullaitivu town, and that troops would capture them soon.

There were also protests in Turkey, where organisers claimed 700,000 people had turned out for an anti-Israeli demonstration. Protesters called on Turkey, Israel's only Muslim ally, to re-evaluate ties with the Jewish state if it does not halt its incursion in the Gaza Strip. In Greece, demonstrators set fire to banks, threw rocks and fired flares at police in the capital Athens. Russia on Sunday said it was "extremely concerned" by Israel's land operation in Gaza and said it was sending a special envoy to the region to help bring about a ceasefire by both sides. Thousands of demonstrators in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, denounced Israel as a "terrorist" force and called on the government to send troops to fight Israeli forces. Iranian warning Iran, which has seen angry protests since the Israeli raids began last week, also added its voice.

China targets Google, Baidu and Internet portals over porn
People use computers at an Internet cafe in Changzhi, north China's Shanxi province June 20, 2007. REUTERS/Stringer BEIJING Three Chinese Internet operators have apologized for failing to purge "vulgar" content following a government pledge this week to expose and shut down offending websites. China on Monday launched a renewed crackdown to stamp out vulgar current on the Internet, which analysts linked to a broader campaign to stifle dissent and protest as the economy slows in a year of politically sensitive anniversaries. Officials named and shamed 19 Internet operators and websites, including search engines Google and Baidu, it said had flouted warnings about pornography and other content deemed inappropriate by state censors. "We feel deeply guilty," Baidu, China's number one search engine, said in a statement posted on its website on Wednesday. "We apologize to Internet users for any negative effects given to society." NetEase.com.Inc, China's number two online game operator, and SINA Corp also issued public apologies on their websites. "As to our problems and any harm they could possibly have caused Internet users, SINA feels deeply sad and concerned," the online media group said. Google's China office stopped short of offering an apology on its website, but promised to "work hard" with Internet users and society to build a healthy Internet culture. "After we received notice from relevant government departments ... (we) cleaned up links to vulgar content that could have adverse effects on Internet users," it said (here). China's ruling Communist Party is wary of threats to its grip on information and has conducted numerous censorship efforts targeting porn, anti-government criticism and websites selling fake drugs. Analysts have linked the campaign to broader efforts to stifle dissent ahead of sensitive political dates this year, especially the 20th anniversary year of the government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests centered on Beijing's Tian'anmen Square in 1989. China has warned Google and other popular web portals that they must do more to block pornographic material from reaching Chinese users, the latest in a series of government crackdowns targeting internet content.

Matt Smith revealed as 11th incarnation of Doctor Who
The great thing about Doctor Who, as a colleague pointed out, is that you don't have to watch the show to feel part of it. Even when you've exhausted, or been exhausted by "Who will be the next Doctor?" and moved into "I'm sorry, who will be the next Doctor? ", there's still a full cycle of gossip to come: you can speculate about the identity of the Doctor's companion, and then the guest stars, and then the year's big villain, and then – as a pick-me-up at the end – whether this season will be the Doctor's last. At this rate, by the time Matt Smith actually steps into the Tardis, in 2010, we'll probably be vigorously debating the merits of his successor. The BBC certainly knows the value of the publicity to what is, according to audience satisfaction figures, its most-loved show. Whereas the Queen only gets 10 minutes over Christmas, the show's producers were offered a full half-hour on Saturday evening for their message to the nation. Even with all the careful priming, even with the drip-drip of comments that this was the youngest Doctor, that he was only 26, the moment when the boy himself popped up on screen was still a shock. Still, the BBC seems to have got away with it – according to the instant polling provided by a trawl through Facebook, groups such as "We hate Matt Smith as Doctor Who!!!!" Like the actor who must finally accept that he is too old to play the Dane, we have suddenly become Older Than The Doctor, forced to accept that even if we could go gallivanting around the universe with the time-travelling Gallifreyan, we'd be too busy worrying about our pensions to enjoy it.

United Nations suspends operations in Gaza after schools and trucks are hit by Israeli forces
Homes, mosques and government buildings have been hit in the Israeli bombardment [AFP] Homes, mosques and government buildings have been hit in the Israeli bombardment [AFP] 'Tragic deaths' John Ging, the head of Unrwa in Gaza, said the casualties in Thursday's convoy attack were Palestinian civilian contractors hired to bring supplies from the crossing points. "They were co-ordinating their movements with the Israelis, as they always do, only to find themselves being fired at from the ground troops," he told Al Jazeera. We have been reassured continuously over the last number of days that these incidents will not reoccur, and I have taken that in good faith because of the humanitarian imperative. "We want to believe we are safe here ... but the bottom line is that I've lost confidence in the Israeli side and that needs to be restored urgently, and it is their duty to restore this confidence," Ging said. All convoys to Erez and the Kerem Shalom, which has been the main crossing point used for bringing humanitarian supplies into Gaza, were suspended after the incident. Also on Thursday, Israel said it halted its military operations for three hours to allow humanitarian aid into the strip. Explosions were heard in northern Gaza shortly after the three-hour lull, but even during the three hours, Israeli bulldozers crossed into Gaza and destroyed a number of houses, Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from southern Israel near the border, said. Rafah bombing Thousands of Palestinians fled their homes in the southern Gaza Strip as Israeli forces bombarded Rafah earlier on Thursday. The Israeli military had dropped leaflets beforehand, warning it would "bomb the area due to its use by terrorists to [dig] tunnels and to stock up [on weapons]".

Spider-Man to save Obama's Inauguration Day in upcoming Marvel comic
NEW YORK Barack Obama will be "nerd-in-chief" when he takes office as U.S. president this month, according to Marvel Comics, which is putting him on the cover of its next "Spider-Man" comic. The special edition of the weekly Spider-Man comic features a six-page story about the superhero saving the day when an imposter tries to take Obama's place as president. It is due to hit newsstands next Wednesday. Marvel editor in chief Joe Quesada said the idea for the "Spidey meets the President!" edition came from a statement from Obama's campaign listing 10 little known facts about the Democrat who will be America's first black president. "Right at the top of that list was he collected Spider-Man comics," Quesada told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. "I was inundated with tons of fan mail saying 'Have you read this?'" "I was just floored, absolutely floored, to find out that the future commander-in-chief was actually going to be the future nerd-in-chief." Excitement about Obama's election has already fueled a boom in memorabilia, from posters to front pages of November 5 newspapers announcing his victory. Spidey hangs upside down behind him whispering in his ear: "Hey, if you get to be on my cover, can I be on the dollar bill?" The story is set on January 20 in Washington, where Spidey's alter ego, Peter Parker, is on assignment as a photographer covering Inauguration Day. When an imposter turns up, Spider-Man leaps into action, greeting Obama with the words: "Hiya, prez-elect!

Illinois House impeaches Blagojevich
Hours after the Illinois House of Representatives voted 114-1 to impeach Gov. Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges that include his allegedly trying to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama, the governor reiterated Friday, "I am not guilty of any criminal wrongdoing." "I am confident that at the end of the day, I will be properly exonerated," Blagojevich said at a rambling press conference which ended, as had his first news conference following his Dec. 9 arrest, with his quoting a British poet. Blagojevich added that the full House vote was "not a surprise" because, "What the House did today they've been talking about doing for the last couple of years." He was joined onstage at his news conference by a man in a wheelchair and various other individuals he claimed were helped by his policies, and he blamed the Illinois House for repeatedly standing in the way of his bringing advances to the people of Illinois. He referenced various efforts to extend health care only to be blocked, he said, by a House chamber that "consistently stood in the way of those expansions." After quoting Rudyard Kipling at an earlier press conference, the governor this time drew from Alfred Lord Tennyson's "Ulysses," reciting, "Though we are not now the strength which in old days moved Earth and Heaven, that which we are, we are. One equal temper, of heroic hearts, made weak by time and by fate, but strong in will, to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield." Blagojevich has harmed the people of this state, and by refusing to recognize his utter inability to govern effectively, he continues this harm," she said. "I call on the governor, once again, to do what is right, what is best for the people and what is clearly long overdue: The governor should resign immediately."

MV Sirius Star oil tanker released by pirates
The Saudi supertanker seized by Somali pirates in the world's biggest ever hijacking has been freed following a reported ransom payment of $3m. Last night the US navy released a photo showing a small package apparently containing the ransom parachuting to the deck of the Sirius Star from a small aircraft. A parachute apparently containing the $3m ransom floats down to the hijacked Sirius Star. Photograph: David Hudson/AP The Sirius Star, which was carrying 2m barrels of oil when it was captured on November 15, sailed from the pirate lair of Harardheere on Somalia's eastern coast today. Two Britons – chief engineer Peter French, from County Durham, and second officer James Grady, from Renfrewshire – are among the crew of 25 who were all reported to be unharmed. The ship is free, the crew is free," Mohamed Said, one of the pirate leaders, told Agence France-Presse by telephone. "There were last-minute problems but now everything has been finalised." An associate of the pirates, who call themselves the Central Regional Coastguard (CRC), said the owner of the ship, the oil giant Saudi Aramco, had paid a ransom of $3m (£2m). The hijacking of the 330-metre long vessel was the culmination of a dramatic surge in piracy off Somalia this year.

Too Grimm? Mother Goose cartoonist sued by Colombian coffee growers
The character of Juan Valdez was created 50 years ago Colombian coffee growers are planning to sue a US cartoonist for millions of dollars over a cartoon they say damages the reputation of Colombian coffee. The cartoon is by Mike Peters, whose work is published in the US and abroad. In it, one character refers to crime in Colombia and then to Juan Valdez, the fictional coffee grower used for years to advertise Colombian coffee. Coffee growers say the cartoon links their industry with violence. Mr Peters has said he intended no offence. The cartoon strip which appeared on 2 January is part of the Mother Goose and Grimm series that Mr Peters draws. This plays on a former slogan used to advertise Colombian coffee. The comic strip finishes with Mother Goose drinking tea. National dignity Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation, Fedecafe, said they had instructed their lawyers in the US to begin proceedings against Mr Peters and the agency which distributes his work, for "damage and harm, detriment to intellectual property and defamation". In a statement, Fedecafe said the cartoon "associated organised crime and the atrocities committed by violent groups with the hard, delicate and honest work of more than 500,000 coffee growers and their families". The cartoon also affected the reputation of Juan Valdez, the "icon and symbol" of Colombian coffee, by suggesting that there was a connection between coffee tins and the victims of violence, Fedecafe said. The iconic coffee grower, accompanied by his faithful mule, was created in 1959, and has appeared in countless TV advertisements, in the US and elsewhere.

"Our immediate priority is to ensure sustainability of services with minimum disruption," Mr Parekh said. "We will provide strategic direction to Satyam, not run it on a daily basis. We are looking to induct fresh blood, like the chief executive and chief financial officer into the company, but it will take time," he added.

Parajet Skycar expedition takes off from London to Timbuktu
LONDON, England (CNN) -- From the noisy and lovable Chitty Chitty Bang Bang to the time-traveling DeLorean in "Back to the Future," flying cars have been a fixture of movies and science fiction that never quite cut it in the real world -- until now. The Skycar's fabric wing is folded and packed in the back of the car when driving on the road. A flying car devised by a British inventor and a team of engineers took off from London on Wednesday on an epic journey to Timbuktu, Mali, in West Africa -- a trip they hope will prove the fantasy has become reality. The "Skycar" is a road-legal all-terrain buggy with a huge rear propeller and a fabric wing, the result of 18 months of design and research. "We started with a car rather than starting with an aircraft and made a car into an aircraft," said Skycar's creator, Giles Cardozo. "It's a really exciting piece of kit to drive but of course, it also flies." Its design gives it the performance of a motorbike while also allowing it to fly over impassable terrain and the sand seas of the Sahara, the designers said. The two-person seat is a tight fit with room for a driver and a passenger who controls the car in flight. Don't Miss Skycar Expedition 2009 "I'm a bit nervous, but that's what adventure and exploration's all about," Laughton told CNN. Watch as flying car takes off » Although some eccentric-looking flying cars have been attempted before, Cardozo and his team of engineers say advances in flexible wing technology have made their car more practical, with more precise handling and increased safety over traditional rigid wings. The flexible wing is folded and packed in the back of the car when driving on the road and can deploy immediately when it is ready to fly.

Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Day 20
(CNN) -- Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has apparently released a new audio message calling for a jihad, or holy war, against Israel for its Gaza campaign. Osama bin Laden, in an undated photo, apparently taped a message calling for jihad against Israel. The 22-minute message contains "an invitation" from bin Laden to take part in "jihad to stop the aggression against Gaza." The audio message was posted on a radical Islamist Web site that has posted other statements from bin Laden in the past. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the message, but the speaker's voice was similar to other recordings that bin Laden has made. While not naming President-elect Barack Obama, bin Laden refers to the future of the United States in the face of the current global economic crisis. Watch as experts discuss Osama message » "[America is] now drowning in a global financial crisis," he said. "The decline of the American power is one of the main reasons for Israel's rushed and barbaric aggression on Gaza in a desperate attempt to take advantage of the last days of [President] Bush's term in office." He appears, however, to refer to Obama, saying "Bush leaves his successor with the worst inheritance ... two long guerrilla wars and no options. "Here is Biden, the vice president of the president-elect ... [he] says that the crisis is bigger than they expected and that the American economy, all of it, is open to collapse," bin Laden said. On December 20, Biden said in an interview that the economy "is in much worse shape than we thought it was in."

Pressure Thailand to release jailed Aust author: Xenophon Updated Independent Senator Nick Xenophon has called on the Federal Government to do everything it can to bring an Australian man jailed in Thailand back home. Melbourne writer Harry Nicolaides, 41, has been jailed for three years in Bangkok over a passage he wrote in a 2005 novel about the Thai Crown Prince. Senator Xenophon says the Government should put pressure on Thailand to allow him to return to Australia. His Australian lawyer, Mark Dean SC, says the imprisonment has taken a heavy toll on his physical and mental health. Acting Victorian Premier Rob Hulls says he has enquired about whether he can assist Nicolaides. His legal team will apply for a royal pardon this week but he has already served five months in jail.

Never mind that Flacco had never played on a stage this size.

Death sentences in 2008 Chinese tainted milk scandal
SHIJIAZHUANG, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The former board chairwoman of the Sanlu Group, Tian Wenhua, plans to appeal after being sentenced to jail for life for her role in the melamine scandal, according to her lawyer Liang Zikai on Saturday. prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" / Liang told Xinhua that Tian plans to appeal because the judgment said that the milk powder produced by Sanlu since Aug. 2damaged consumers' health, while she and her lawyers believe the ruling lacks evidence. Tian was convicted of manufacturing and selling fake or substandard products by the Shijiazhuang Intermediate People's Court and sentenced to life in prison Thursday. She was also fined 24.7 million yuan (3.6 million U.S. dollars). Three other former Sanlu executives received sentences of 5 to 15 years in jail for their roles in the scandal that left at least six Chinese infants dead and almost 300,000 ill. Sanlu decided to limit the level of melamine within 10 mg for every kg of milk, instead of ceasing production of melamine-tainted products, on Aug. 1 last year after the Hebei Provincial Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau confirmed samples sent by the company were contaminated. Tian said last month during her trial that she made the decision not to halt production of the tainted products because a board member, designated by New Zealand dairy product giant Fonterra that partly owned Sanlu Group, presented her a document saying a maximum of 20 mg of melamine was allowed in every kg of milk in the European Union. She said she had trusted the document at that time. Liang said Tian should be convicted of liability in a major accident instead of manufacturing and selling fake or substandard products. Tian would have received a sentence of up to seven years in jail under a conviction of liability of a major accident. Mao said those who still remained in designated hospitals for having stones in kidney an d other parts of urinary system after drinking melamine contaminated milk, will continue to receive free treatment. "Children under three years old, who had drunk tainted milk and had disease symptoms could still come to local hospitals for check-ups, and would receive free treatment if diagnosed with stones in the urinary system," the spokesman said.

Encyclopædia Britannica fights back against Wikipedia, soon to let users edit contents
What do television presenter Vernon Kay, Apple's CEO Steve Jobs and senator Ted Kennedy have in common? Answer: they have all been falsely reported as dead on Wikipedia. Premature news of Ted Kennedy's demise appeared on the day of President Obama's inauguration, along with a similar report about the supposed death of the longest serving senator, Robert Byrd. They are just the latest incidents in a long and rich history of vandalism since the 2001 launch of the online encyclopaedia which anyone can amend. To date, Wikipedia has allowed almost anybody to make changes to most of its 2.7m entries. Until an American journalist was falsely linked in 2005 to the JFK assassination, you didn't even have to be registered to make changes. But the false death notices of two of America's most prominent politicians has lead co-founder Jimmy Wales to propose that all future amendments by site users now be approved by a group of editors. Some Wiki enthusiasts are worried that the future of the site, currently ranked as the world's seventh largest, will be threatened. In the entry for Obama's predecessor, a prankster wrote that "dubya" stood for "w******". At the height of his unpopularity, Tony Blair was briefly given the middle-name "Whoop-de-doo", while one vandal erased the entire entry for Harry Potter, replacing it with the brutal plot spoiler: "Snape is the half-blood prince and kills Dumbledore." The entry on dyslexia has suffered from anonymous users enjoying regularly scrambling the text.

Ten climbers killed in avalanche at Turkish ski resort
An avalanche slammed into a group of Turkish hikers on a trip to a remote mountain plateau on Sunday, dragging them more than 1,640 feet into a valley and fatally burying 10. The members of a skiing and mountaineering club were taking part in an annual winter sports celebration on 7,200-foot Mount Zigana. Seventeen were hiking single-file when the avalanche swept into them. In France, on Sunday two female skiers lost their lives in the Savoie region - a woman in her seventies when she was hit by an avalanche while cross-country skiing in Areches Beaufort, and a 45-year-old Swiss woman who was when skiing off-piste in La Toussuire. The body of a 21-year-old man was also uncovered by a team of sniffer dogs after he was buried in a metre of snow while skiing off-piste in the Deux-Alpes holiday resort. Finally, two skiers, aged 16 and 18, also lost their lives while skiing off-piste in Saint-Francois-Longchamp at the Valmorel resort, despite the efforts of the emergency services to revive them. French weather forecasters had given out an avalanche warning on Saturday. ISTANBUL An avalanche that swept down a mountain near a small winter resort killed 10 climbers in northeast Turkey on Sunday, but seven of their companions survived the crush, a government minister said.

Iceland's coalition government falls in economic crisis
Prime Minister Geir Haarde had called early elections for May Iceland's coalition government has collapsed under the strain of an escalating economic crisis. Conservative Prime Minister Geir Haarde announced the resignation of his cabinet, after talks with his Social Democratic coalition partners failed. He said he could not accept the Social Democrats' demand to lead the country. Iceland's financial system collapsed in October under the weight of debt, leading to a currency crisis, rising unemployment and daily protests. The economy is forecast to shrink by almost 10% this year. The coalition between Mr Haarde's Independence Party and Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Gisladottir's Social Democratic Alliance had been under strain in recent months. Mr Haarde told reporters on Monday: "We couldn't accept the Social Democratic demand that they would lead the government." Meltdown The announcement comes three days after the prime minister called an early general election for 9 May, adding that he would not stand for health reasons. The coalition government, in place since 2007, had been due to remain in place until 2011. "The government's actions in the last weeks and months were not swift enough," she said. Her party is now expected to look for new partners to form a government until the election.

Tamil Tigers promise to fight back against Sri Lankan forces
Sri Lankan troops kept the heat on the Tamil Tiger separatists on Monday, a day after seizing the last big town held by the rebels, Mullaittivu. The army's commander, Lieutenant-General Sarath Fonseka, has said the military is close to ending one of Asia's longest-running wars. Few would disagree now that he has the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) all but encircled. Here are some scenarios of what could happen next: FONSEKA'S MARCH TO THE SEA: This month alone, soldiers have run the Tigers out of their self-proclaimed capital Kilinochchi, the Jaffna Peninsula and now the port of Mullaittivu, a major LTTE operations base. When hostilities were reignited in August 2006, the rebels held 15,000 square km (5,792 sq miles). Now, Fonseka says they have only 300 square km (186 square miles) of jungle and a diminishing stretch of the northeastern coast. Much as U.S. civil war Major-General William Tecumseh Sherman made the rebel Confederate army surrender by forcing them to all but jump in the sea at Savannah, Georgia, Fonseka is doing the same -- unless his troops seize the coast and surround the LTTE. Since the Tigers wear vials of cyanide around their necks in case of capture, surrender seems unlikely. Many analysts say the rebels are down to about 2,000 capable fighters and have little future as a conventional force. The military is now much better equipped and trained than in the past, has President Mahinda Rajapaksa's full backing and experienced, confident leadership in the form of his brother, Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and Fonseka. The LTTE still can carry out suicide bombings in the capital Colombo, and is blamed for one Just after Kilinochchi fell.

Both the unions and the government expect massive turnout, with an opinion poll published by the newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche saying 69 percent of French people backed it. Following are some facts about the planned strike. The unions have been seething since President Nicolas Sarkozy said last July that France had changed so rapidly under his stewardship that "these days, when there is a strike, nobody notices". After a first 18 months in power when no amount of protest could deter Sarkozy from pushing through his reform plans, he has recently shelved an unpopular shake-up of the high school system after street protests. If there is massive participation in the strike, that could further discourage Sarkozy from attempting tough reforms. The eight unions issued a joint document listing demands on both the government and company managers.

Renowned US novelist John Updike has died at the age of 76, his publisher has announced. He had been suffering from lung cancer. Updike won many top literary prizes, including Pulitzers for two volumes of his famous Rabbit series. In about 50 books over half a century, he chronicled sex, divorce and other aspects of life in post-war America. He once told an interviewer that his subject was "the American small town, Protestant middle class". He died in a hospice near his home in Beverly Farms, Massachussetts, his publisher said. The son of a schoolmaster, Updike was born in Pennsylvania in 1932 and, after attending Harvard, spent a year as an art student in Oxford in the UK. Later he joined the staff of the New Yorker magazine, to which he contributed numerous poems, essays and short stories. Updike's first novel, The Poorhouse Fair, was published in 1959.

Red Cross urges Sri Lanka to respect lives of Tamil civilians
(For related story, click on [nCOL285917] By C. Bryson Hull COLOMBO, Jan 28 (Reuters) -- Hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans are trapped in a war zone that is now roughly 300 square km (115 sq miles) and the scene of heavy fighting between the Tamil Tiger rebels and a Sri Lankan army smelling victory. Here are questions and answers about their situation. The government says that figure is too high. The Tigers have not given a tally but on Tuesday, the pro-rebel web site www.TamilNet.com said 300,000 people now face hunger. The ICRC, the only aid agency with a permanent presence in the war zone, say hundreds have been killed and injured, but has not given an exact figure. The government tacitly acknowledged casualties on Wednesday, but says it has no official number and says figures reported so far are inflated. Human Rights Watch and the Sri Lankan government say the Tigers have forced people to stay at gunpoint, and are using them to fight, build defences or act as a human shield. The Tigers, who for years have had a policy of making every family hand one person over to fight, deny that. They say the people are staying of their own free will and fear government persecution at army-guarded refugee camps.

Scottish politician to face perjury trial
The couple have denied the allegations of perjury Former Solidarity MSP and Celebrity Big Brother contestant Tommy Sheridan and his wife Gail are to stand trial on perjury charges. The charges relate to evidence given during Mr Sheridan's defamation victory against the News of the World in 2006. The newspaper had published sex and drugs claims against Mr Sheridan. The couple, both aged 44, were charged with perjury in December 2007 following an investigation by Lothian and Borders Police. The investigation was launched after a judge said conflicting evidence in the defamation trial may have meant some people were perjuring themselves. During a news conference on Tuesday, the couple's solicitor, Aamer Anwar, read a statement confirming that they would stand trial. Mr Sheridan was evicted from Celebrity Big Brother on 21 January He said: "I can confirm that an indictment was served today for charges of perjury against Thomas and Gail Sheridan. "A preliminary hearing is fixed for 26 February 2009 at the High Court in Edinburgh and a trial will then be fixed for later on in the year. "As proceedings are live it would be inappropriate to comment further, other than to state that both Mr and Mrs Sheridan maintain their innocence and are determined to fight this. "There will be no further statements or interviews and we would ask the media to respect the Sheridan family's privacy." The Crown Office confirmed that an indictment had been served. It said the indictment contained one charge of perjury and one charge of attempted subornation of perjury - or persuading another to commit perjury - against Mr Sheridan.

Iran's Ahmadinejad wants change in US policies, not 'tactics'
Iran's president called for the U.S. to apologize for past misdeeds Wednesday but also said the country would welcome a real and fundamental shift in foreign policy from the new American administration. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's comments came after President Barack Obama indicated a new willingness to reach out to Muslims and the importance of engaging with Iran, a country the Bush administration often singled out as the most dangerous in the region. Without mentioning Obama by name, Ahmadinejad repeatedly referred to those who want to bring "change," a word used often in Obama's election campaign, and seemed to indicate Iran would be looking to see whether there would be substantive differences in U.S. policy under Obama. "We will wait patiently, listen to their words carefully, scrutinize their actions under a magnifier and if change happens truly and fundamentally, we will welcome that," Ahmadinejad said, speaking to a crowd of thousands in the western city of Kermanshah. "Those who say they want to make change, this is the change they should make: they should apologize to the Iranian nation and try to make up for their dark background and the crimes they have committed against the Iranian nation," Ahmadinejad said. He listed a range of "crimes" such as trying to block what Tehran says is a peaceful nuclear power generation program, hindering Iran's development since the 1979 revolution and other actions by several administrations for more than 60 years. He also called on Washington to withdraw its troops from around the world and stop supporting Israel. In his speech, Ahmadinejad said: "Who has asked them (the United States) to come and interfere in the affairs of nations? "Change means giving up support for the rootless, uncivilized, fabricated, murdering... Zionists and let the Palestinian nation decide its own destiny," he said. Speaking in his first formal television interview as president, Obama told Al-Arabiya news channel that Iran must "unclench its fist". The new administration has said Obama would break from his predecessor by pursuing direct talks with Tehran but has also warned Iran to expect more pressure if it did not meet the U.N. Security Council demand to halt its disputed nuclear work.

Zimbabwe opposition agrees to join government
Mr. Tsvangirai first agreed to form a joint government in September, but then refused after Mr. Mugabe claimed control of all the ministries that control the repressive state security forces, including the police.

Acknowledging the ambivalence of many of his supporters — and perhaps his own, as well — Mr. Tsvangirai said in a statement that the fight for democracy “is neither easy nor straightforward, and often we have had to change the fronts on which we wage the struggle.” Political analysts said he would have risked the scorn of South Africa, the dominant regional powerhouse, and other neighboring nations, had he pulled out of the deal that they had, with increasing impatience, been pressing him to accept.

US Republicans elect first African-American chairman
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Members of the Republican National Committee elected their first African-American party chief Friday, choosing former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele to chair the organization after six tumultuous rounds of voting. The often contentious race for the chairmanship came down to a choice on the final ballot between Steele and Katon Dawson, the South Carolina GOP chairman who secured strong support from party insiders after former RNC leader Mike Duncan dropped out of the race earlier in the day. Steele emerged as the winner on the sixth ballot, winning 91 votes to Dawson's 77. "We're going to say to friend and foe alike, we want you to be a part of us," Steele told party members in his victory speech. Watch Steele's remarks to the RNC » For the duration of his campaign, Steele fought suspicions that he was too moderate to lead the party because of his blue state roots and his former membership in the Republican Leadership Council, a group that sought to curb the influence of social conservatives in the party. "I'm proud to say I'm a conservative, have been, always will be," Steele told CNN this month. Steele was similarly hampered by the perception that he was too much of an outsider to run the 168-member committee, but he was able to demonstrate momentum in the final days of the campaign by rolling out a cluster of endorsements. He also boasted the help of some of the country's top political consultants: At a closed-door question-and-answer session with members late Thursday, Steele told the crowd he had spent more than $200,000 on the race, more than any other contender.

British PM condemns walkouts
Wildcat strikes are "not defensible", Gordon Brown has told those angry at the employment of foreign workers. Hundreds of employees staged walkouts across the UK over the use of foreign staff at a Lincolnshire refinery. The PM told the BBC's Politics Show he understood workers' fears, but walkouts were "not the right thing to do". The Tories said they did not back the strikes either but said Mr Brown's 2007 "British jobs for British workers" pledge had been exposed as "fiction". Unofficial "sympathy strikes" spread across the country after workers walked out at the Lindsey Oil Refinery when owner Total gave a £200m contract to Italian firm IREM. You'll find that no government in history is doing more to try and find ways that we can help people who are unemployed back in to work as quickly as possible Gordon Brown PM says 'no clear map' for crisis Mandelson warns on protectionism The government has called in independent mediator Acas to look into claims that British workers are being illegally excluded from engineering and construction projects, while unions have urged Mr Brown to meet heads of industry in the sectors as soon as possible. 'Undercut' Speaking from the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Mr Brown said instead of spontaneous strike action, "what we've got to do over time, as I've always said, is that where there are jobs in this country, we need people with the skills, developed in this country". Tackled about his 2007 Labour conference pledge to create "British jobs for British workers" - a slogan used by the striking refinery workers - Mr Brown said: "Well, we are part of a single European market but I have always understood the worries that people have. WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW On BBC One: The Politics Show, 1200, Sunday 1 February Or watch it for up to seven days on the BBC iPlayer "They look round and say, well, why can't we do these jobs, jobs ourselves, these are jobs that we can do. "When, when I talked about British jobs, I was taking about giving people in Britain the skills, so that they have the ability to get jobs which were at present going to people from abroad." Health Secretary Alan Johnson said EU laws guaranteeing employment rights had been "undermined" by two recent judgements in the European Court of Justice and the government would push for action at a European level if it was proved British workers were being "undercut" by cheap labour from other parts of the EU. HAVE YOUR SAY It is a shame that it has come to this, but necessary if this is the only way it will get our government to put our interests above others.

Shoe thrown at Chinese PM during speech at Cambridge University in the UK
The Chinese prime minister was giving a speech about the global economy A 27-year-old man has been charged after a shoe was thrown at Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao during a visit to Cambridge University. Police said the man would appear before magistrates in Cambridge on 10 February accused of committing a public order offence. The shoe was thrown at Mr Wen and he was called a "dictator" as he gave a speech on the global economy on Monday. The premier, on a three-day UK visit, described the incident as "despicable". Mr Wen was giving his speech having earlier signed a series of trade agreements with UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The protest was similar to an event in December when US President George W Bush was forced to duck to avoid shoes thrown at him by an Iraqi journalist in Baghdad. On Sunday, five people were arrested during a Free Tibet demonstration in London after trying to approach Mr Wen as he arrived at the Chinese Embassy. The shoe landed several meters from the premier and the man was quickly apprehended by security and handed over to police for questioning on suspicion of committing a public order offence, according to witnesses. A student who witnessed the incident told CNN that the man had stood up and shouted, "Why are you prostituting yourself?

Obama cabinet nominees withdraw over tax issues
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday admitted he made a mistake in handling the nomination of Tom Daschle as his Health and Human Services secretary, saying Daschle's tax problems sent a message that the politically powerful are treated differently than average people. Daschle, the former Democratic leader in the U.S. Senate, withdrew earlier Tuesday as news that he failed to pay some taxes in the past continued to stir opposition on Capitol Hill. "I think I screwed up," Obama said in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. "And, I take responsibility for it and we're going to make sure we fix it so it doesn't happen again." Daschle had apologized Monday for what he said were honest mistakes, calling them an embarrassment. The series of errors included improperly reporting $15,000 in charitable donations, failing to list $80,000 in lobbying income due to what Daschle said was a paperwork error and not reporting a car and driver loaned to him by a friend and business associate as income.

Saudi most-wanted list includes former Guantanamo captives
Al-Qaeda's Yemen branch reportedly has a new deputy chief, a Saudi named Saeed al-Shihri. When I was in Saudi Arabia in 2007 to report on the Kingdom's much publicized rehabilitation program, which aims to turn jihadi fighters into peaceful citizens, al-Shihri was one of the enrollees. Saeed al-Shihiri, from an undated video posted on a militant-leaning website on Jan. 23, 2009. The identity was confirmed by a U.S. intelligence official but has not been independently verified. (SITE Intelligence Group/Associated Press) After spending six years in U.S. custody at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, he was sent to his homeland and entered the Saudi rehab in November 2007. According to an internet news release by Yemen militants, corroborated by the New York Times quoting an unnamed U.S. intelligence official, al-Shihri has become a top member of Yemen's al-Qaeda affiliate. Other reports say that many ex-Guantanamo inmates have returned to the battlefield. It is clearly going to be a problem as well for the Muslim and Western nations, including Canada, who are being asked to consider taking back their own detained citizens and somehow deal with them. (CBC) The Saudis themselves refer to their program to rehabilitate former jihadists as the "soft approach" and boast 225 graduates since its inception in the summer of 2007.

American baseball star Rodriguez admits to using performance enhancing drugs
New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez admitted to ESPN's Peter Gammons today in an exclusive interview that he took performance-enhancing drugs from 2001 to 2003. "I did take a banned substance, and for that, I'm very sorry," Rodriguez said. Rodriguez told Gammons that he felt an "enormous amount of pressure" when he arrived as a member of the Texas Rangers in 2001 after signing the largest contract in Major League Baseball history. Play "Back then, [baseball] was a different culture. I wanted to prove to everyone I was worth being one of the greatest players of all time," Rodriguez said. He said he took the banned substances from 2001 to 2003 and has not taken any since. Play "Since then, I've proved to myself and to everyone that I don't need any of that," he said. Rodriguez reportedly tested positive for the banned substances Primobolan and testosterone in 2003 while still with the Texas Rangers, a year before Major League Baseball implemented a program to suspend players who were found using performance-enhancing drugs, according to a report from Sports Illustrated. His sample, along with 103 other players who tested positive, could legally have been destroyed by the players union, but for reasons still unknown, the samples were kept and later seized by federal investigators.

Subject of high-profile Italian euthanasia case dies
Eluana Englaro, seen in this undated photo, fell into a vegetative state following a car accident in 1992. ((Englaro family/Associated Press)) The Italian woman at the centre of a high-profile euthanasia debate has died, media agencies reported Monday. Eluana Englaro, who had been in a vegetative state for 17 years, died in a clinic in the northeastern city of Udine, the ANSA and Apcom news agencies said. "Yes, she has left us," her father, Beppino Englaro, told ANSA. "But I don't want to say anything, I just want to be alone." Englaro's case has pitted right-to-die activists against the anti-euthanasia movement. Late last year, her father won an intense 10-year legal battle to allow her feeding tubes to be removed, saying that was her wish. In line with the high court ruling, medical workers on Friday began gradually suspending food and water for Englaro. Berlusconi's government had passed an emergency decree Friday to prevent Englaro from having her tube disconnected, but the move led to a rare institutional crisis as the country's president, Giorgio Napolitano, rejected it on the grounds it defied court rulings. Patients have a right to refuse treatment, but they are barred from giving advance directions on what treatment they wish to receive if they become unconscious.

Judd Gregg withdraws as US Commerce Secretary nominee
New Hampshire Republican Sen. Judd Gregg has withdrawn his name from consideration as President Obama's commerce secretary, a major blow to an administration seeking to put a series of Cabinet problems behind it. "It became clear to me to me that it would be very difficult day in and day out to serve in this Cabinet," Gregg said in a press conference late Thursday. He added that in the days since he was nominated he realized that to be "part of a team but not 100 percent with the team" was an untenable position. In his written statement, Gregg cited recent developments regarding the economic stimulus package and the decision to have the next census director report directly to senior White House officials as evidence that he and President Obama were too different ideologically for the pairing to work. "This was simply a bridge too far for me," Gregg said of his decision. Gregg said he would "probably not" run for re-election in 2010. Gregg abstained from the Senate vote on the stimulus package, which passed the chamber 61 to 37. Many Republicans, however, had voiced serious concerns about the potential politicization of the department given that move. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) praised Gregg's decision as "principled" and added: "It's great to have him back." Mr Gregg made the decision because of policy differences with the Obama administration, he said in a statement.

Class action launched by Australian bushfire survivors against SP AusNet
(Recasts, adds details) PERTH Feb 16 Australian energy firm SP AusNet, controlled by Singapore Power, said it was facing a class-action lawsuit relating to the country's deadliest bushfires which killed 181 people and destroyed thousands of homes. SP AusNet SPN.AX said an action was launched on Monday in the Supreme Court of the eastern state of Victoria from groups which alleged that faulty power lines owned by SP AusNet may have sparked Australia's deadliest bushfires. "We believe the claim is premature and inappropriate ... SP AusNet will vigorously defend the claim," SP AusNet's spokeswoman Louisa Graham said in an e-mailed statement. The company said its bushfire mitigation and vegetation management programmes comply with state regulations and were audited annually by state agencies. Shares in SP AusNet closed 3.7 percent lower at A$1.045 on Monday, after earlier falling as much as 13.4 percent to a one-month low of A$0.94. SP AusNet supplies power to areas in Victoria state where fires killed at least 181 people just over a week ago, destroyed more than 1,800 homes and left 7,000 people homeless. In many cases very little, except small amounts of DNA and pieces of jewellery, remain. Stephen Fontana, assistant police commissioner, said the job of identifying victims was a difficult and slow task but "had to be done properly". "We've actually got a team looking at unaccounted for persons and that's checking... data that we have in terms of residents that lived in those areas, bearing in mind there may have been visitors to those areas," he said. Christine Nixon, the police commissioner, warned that more bodies would be found as police gained access to several properties previously too unsafe to access. "When we start to move to cleaning many of these sites up we still may well find some parts of individuals, it's very difficult to deal with," she said.

Two nuclear submarines collide in the Atlantic Ocean
Defence chiefs are facing an inquiry into the safety of the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent after British and French submarines, each laden with missiles powerful enough for 1,248 Hiroshima bombings, collided while submerged in the mid-Atlantic. HMS Vanguard, the lead boat of Britain's fleet of four V-class submarines armed with Trident nuclear missiles, limped back into its home port of Faslane in Scotland on Saturday showing significant damage. Witnesses said the hull was scarred with dents and scrapes. The weather was rough in the middle of the night of 3 and 4 February when the British submarine, which was carrying 135 crew, struck Le Triomphant, the flagship of the French nuclear strike force, destroying the French vessel's fibreglass sonar dome, which juts out from the bow and, among other tasks, is supposed to detect other submarines. In London, the Ministry of Defence tried to maintain its policy of total secrecy about the movements of Briain's nuclear fleet, but it was forced to confirm the embarrassing collision between strategic allies after the French Navy posted details of the accident on its website. Both countries insisted that neither the missile-launching capacity nor the nuclear safety of the submarines, carrying 265 crew and 32 intercontinental ballistic missiles, were affected. Admiral Sir Jonathon Band, the First Sea Lord, said: "Recently, the two submarines came into contact at very low speed. Defence sources said the accident was the result of the "infinitesimal" coincidence that both submarines were operating at the same depth and location in the Atlantic. Such a claim is undermined because Nato allies routinely share information at a top-secret level about the deployment of submarines to ensure they do not occupy the same area of ocean, an arrangement in which the French, whose nuclear deterrent remains independent, are understood to participate. But nuclear-armed submarines often gravitate towards the same "nesting grounds" – deep, quiet sectors of ocean – to allow them to fulfil their mission by sailing continuously with minimal noise and remaining within range of potential targets. For many years, Britain and France have maintained their nuclear deterrent by ensuring they have at least one of their missile-carrying submarines at sea 365 days a year with the ability to launch within seconds' notice. Politicians said the incident raised serious questions about the precautions to protect the V-class nuclear vessels, which, at nearly 16,000 tonnes and 150m long, are among the largest submarines ever built.

Venezuelan referendum ends presidential term limits
CARACAS, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez won Sunday's referendum on a constitutional amendment for unlimited re-election with about 6.3 million votes, the Electoral National Council (CNE) said on Tuesday. CNE president Tibisay Lucena announced the results at a press conference, based on 99.75 percent of the tallies. Votes in favor of the amendment were 6,319,636, while votes against the amendment were 5,198,006, Lucena said. The total number of votes was 11,724,224 with 30.08 percent abstention. Nearly 17 million Venezuelans were registered to vote in the referendum. Lucena said there were still some votes to be counted, including those of Venezuelans abroad. Chavez won the referendum in 19 of the 23 states, repeating the electoral triumph of the regional elections for governors and mayors held on Nov. 23, 2008. The full and final results of the referendum will be delivered on Wednesday to the National Assembly. Venezuelans on Sunday voted by 54.8% to 45.1% to change the constitution to end term limits and allow elected officials, including President Hugo Chavez, to run for re-election indefinitely. Mr Chavez has said he needs another 10 years to secure what he calls Venezuela's socialist revolution. Here, four Venezuelans discuss whether the outcome of the referendum is good for their country. ANA IRENE MENDEZ, 70, PROFESSOR, MARACAIBO I voted for the amendments and I am very pleased with the result.

Israel seizes West Bank land
He and his ultranationalist Israel Beiteinu party finished in a strong third place in last week's parliamentary elections. Now, he is being courted as a coalition partner by both of the leading political parties. Leaders of the centrist Kadima party, which came in first, and the conservative Likud party, which finished a close second, are both aggressively wooing Lieberman. The burly 50-year-old former nightclub bouncer from Moldova and his party got more seats in the Knesset than the once-dominant Israeli Labor Party. Kadima and Likud are now offering top Cabinet positions — and more, says Danny Ayalon, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States and a newly elected member of parliament on Lieberman's ticket. "I would say the important thing right now is to have a broad-based coalition," Ayalon says. Inflaming Tensions Between Israel's Arabs And Jews But to be part of a broad-based government, Lieberman and his party have to overcome political obstacles and hostility from many corners. Many Israeli Arab politicians and Jewish liberals in Israel call Lieberman a dangerous racist for advocating a citizenship law that would require loyalty oaths to the state. "You're either for his idea of loyalty for citizenship, or you're against it." Barak says many Jewish Israelis were outraged by images of Israeli Arab citizens protesting in favor of Hamas and Hezbollah during Israel's wars with those militant groups. "It got his supporters riled up, and it was able to attract support from other places," says Barak.

Sheffield pub is CAMRA's Pub of the Year
A ONCE semi-derelict "backstreet boozer" in Sheffield is being named today as the national Pub Of The Year. Real ale enthusiasts have chosen the Kelham Island Tavern as the best pub in the country, completing a remarkable turnaround in its fortunes. It only reopened seven years ago after Trevor Wraith and Lewis Gonda transformed the ramshackle building in Russell Street on an industrial fringe of the city centre – and it had to close for six weeks when it was deluged in the floods of summer 2007. But the disaster failed to dampen the enthusiasm of customers and staff – and the reward comes today with the national award from the Campaign for Real Ale, the first Sheffield pub to receive the accolade. Trevor, licensee and owner, said it usually seemed to go to "thatched country pubs in the south with a big fancy food menu", not "a small back street boozer" between factories. The award was also good for Sheffield, he said, enhancing the national reputation of Kelham Island for its real ale circuit. "I don't think a lot of people know that the cluster of real ale pubs in the area attracts hordes of people from across the country. You get to know them by name, even though they live 100 miles away. National judges called anonymously to check the quality of its real ale, customer service, dcor, clientele mix and value for money. Julian Hough, Camra's pubs director and one of the final judges, said: "It truly is a pub for everyone and its attention to detail is fantastic. To have won so many awards in such a short space of time, even enduring a disastrous flood in 2007, is a true testament to the dedication and commitment of its staff."

LTTE strikes Sri Lanka capital
Two Tamil Tiger aircraft launched an attack on Colombo last night sending a message of defiance to the Sri Lankan government which believes it is close to defeating the rebels, who are holed-up in the north-east of the country. At least two people were confirmed dead last night and a further 50 injured after the Sri Lankan military shot down the light aircraft, one of which crashed into a tax office building. Rebel fighters are boxed into a 34-square mile pocket of dense forest, convincing the Sri Lankan government that an end is in sight to the decades-long civil war. Witnesses said the air attack started at around 9.30pm as two jets appeared over the city's port area. The light aircraft were met with a barrage of tracer bullets, anti-aircraft fire and flares fired from army defence positions within the city, preventing the pilots from dropping bombs. An air force spokesman, wing commander Janaka Nanayakkara, said one of the felled jets nose-dived into the tax office, shattering the front of the building. The second aircraft was brought down near the town of Katunayake, 20 miles north of Colombo. As the emergency was downgraded late last night, questions emerged over the army response amid claims dozens of bystanders were hit in a crossfire between anti-aircraft guns. The attack, the tenth of its kind in two years, heaps embarrassment on the Sri Lankan government which claimed it had destroyed the rebels' runways a fortnight ago as part of its punishing military campaign to end the 25-year conflict. The Red Cross yesterday pledged to ferry more wounded and sick civilians out of the conflict zone, amid fears of a mounting humanitarian disaster. By Alastair Lawson BBC News The rebels have carried out surprise attacks on many previous occasions The attack by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels on the capital shows that while their conventional capacity has been drastically reduced, their ability to launch surprise attacks is undiminished. They have lost significant tranches of territory to the army and most analysts agree it is only a matter of time before they lose what little land they still hold.

AU peacekeepers killed in Somalia, Islamists vow more attacks
Suicide bomber kills 11 soldiers in Somalia Two bombers, one in a car, target African Union troops in the attack. The soldiers are in Somalia to support its fragile transitional government. He said two suicide bombers -- one in a vehicle and another wearing an explosives-packed vest -- infiltrated the AU base at the former Somali National University. "Go home, otherwise you will meet our hell," Shabab leader Muktar Robow warned AU troops while speaking by telephone to reporters after the attack. Insurgents from the Shabab militia, which claims links to Al Qaeda, took responsibility and vowed to continue assaults against AU soldiers who have been helping shore up Somalia's shaky transitional government. NAIROBI, KENYA — A suicide car bomb attack against African Union peacekeepers in Somalia on Sunday killed 11 Burundian soldiers and wounded 15, the deadliest attack against AU troops since their deployment two years ago. Hundreds of displaced people are living around the campus, and one witness said he saw two civilians among the dead. "I saw a four-wheel-drive car driving at a high speed and then heard a massive explosion," said Kalid Ali Nur, a civilian. Since January, the government has named a new president, prime minister and, on Saturday, a Cabinet. "They are trying to destabilize the situation and take away attention from the good news," said Susannah Price, a spokeswoman for the U.N.'s special representative to Somalia. The attack comes as the AU and United Nations are struggling to boost the number of peacekeepers in Somalia from the current level of about 3,500 Burundian and Ugandan soldiers. AU troops have been subject to increased attacks since Ethiopian soldiers withdrew from the country in January. Newly appointed Somali President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, a former leader of the Islamist alliance that once included Shabab, has been calling upon his former partners to join the government, which was expanded in January to incorporate a major Islamist faction.

Al-Shabaab and AU peacekeepers clash in Somalia
(Adds U.N. Security Council statement, aid appeal, details)  By Abdi Sheikh and Abdi Guled  MOGADISHU, Feb 25 Islamist rebels battled African Union (AU) peacekeepers and Somali police for a second day on Wednesday, taking the death toll in the worst fighting for weeks to 81, witnesses and a rights group said. The local Elman Peace and Human Rights group said 48 civilians had been killed and 90 wounded since early Tuesday. Witnesses said at least 15 Islamist fighters and six policemen were also killed in exchanges of gunfire and mortar bombs that have rocked the coastal capital for two days. The latest violence flared just days after new President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed returned to the coastal city to form an inclusive unity government, the 15th attempt in 18 years to bring peace to the failed Horn of Africa state. In New York, the U.N. Security Council issued a unanimous statement to "condemn in the strongest terms the attacks on the African Union mission in Somalia" and urged all Somalis "to reject violence and extremism." Hardline al Shabaab Islamist gunmen, who have been battling his administration and a 3,500-strong AU peace mission based in the capital, also seized the southcentral town of Hudur from pro-government militias after a short battle Wednesday. "Al Shabaab fighters are now patrolling the town and the other group fled," local elder Hussein Abdi Isak told Reuters by phone from Hudur. He said at least 18 combatants had died. More than 16,000 civilians have been killed in the two-year-old insurgency, one million people have been driven from their homes, more than a third of the population depend on aid, and large parts of Mogadishu lie empty and destroyed. Al Shabaab gained support as one of many insurgent groups waging war against Ethiopian troops propping up the country's previous government. Regional diplomats hope the inclusion of moderate Islamists in the new administration may marginalise hardliners like the group, which is on Washington's list of terrorist organizations and is known to have foreign fighters in its ranks. Some say it could overrun the government, while others say it has only a few thousand fighters and has used the media and high profile strikes to project a more powerful image, despite waning support among traditionally moderate Somali Muslims.

Obama budget calls for record US deficit
President Obama will give more details of his budget in April As promised on the campaign trail, and despite the recession, he wants to increase spending on education, healthcare and the environment and pay for much of that by shifting the tax burden to wealthy Americans. Critics on the right say he is engaging in class warfare, but he says it is just a fairer approach, following eight years when the playing field was tilted towards those with the most resources. At the other end of the scale, the new budget gives more tax breaks to lower and middle income Americans. Education dollars are directed primarily towards two areas: early childhood education, which many educators believe is crucial to later success, and university education, which more and more jobs require. The budget also increases money for basic science research, saying Americans should not fall behind other countries. New government spending on healthcare includes more than $600bn (£419bn) set aside over 10 years for unspecified purposes, but aimed at eventually providing healthcare for all Americans, a goal not shared by everyone. Traditionally proponents of the free market, Americans have been conditioned to distrust anything that smacks of "socialism", but as millions of people join the list of uninsured each year, and employer-provided healthcare becomes more costly and covers less, people in the middle agree that the current, mostly private, healthcare system is not working well. Other funding increases for labour and housing provide money to train young people in "green" jobs, including how to make houses more energy-efficient.

Former Serbian president Milutinovic acquitted of war crimes
Media requires JavaScript to play. Serbian ex-President Milan Milutinovic has been acquitted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Kosovo by a UN war crimes tribunal. Five former top Serbian officials were found guilty on some or all the charges relating to the 1990s conflict. Their sentences range from 15 to 22 years. It was the court's first ruling on alleged crimes committed by Serbian forces in the breakaway region. Mr Milutinovic was seen largely as a figurehead president during that time. The court found that the 66-year-old, who led Serbia from December 1997 to December 2002, had no direct control over the Yugoslav army. His release from custody was ordered. UN TRIBUNAL SENTENCES Nikola Sainovic - 22 years Nebojsa Pavkovic - 22 years Sreten Lukic - 22 years Vladimir Lazarevic - 15 years Dragoljub Ojdanic - 15 years  Summary of judgment [137KB] Judge Iain Bonomy pointed the finger at then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, saying: "In practice, it was Milosevic, sometimes termed the 'Supreme Commander', who exercised actual command authority over the [Serb army] during the Nato campaign." In the late 1990s, Milosevic's forces were attempting to suppress the ethnic Albanian majority's independence campaign in Kosovo. The region, under UN control after Nato drove out Serb forces in 1999, unilaterally declared independence from Serbia a year ago. Mr Milutinovic and his fellow defendants at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) - all of whom had been allies of Milosevic - had denied all the charges against them.

Afghan protestors shot after mosque raid sparks anger
GHAZNI, Afghanistan Feb 27 Six people were hurt when Afghan police opened fire on demonstrators who claimed U.S. troops had desecrated a Koran during a raid on a mosque. The incident took place in Deh Khodaidad village in Ghazni, southwest of the capital, Kabul. Police said a government team had been sent to investigate claims that foreign troops had raided the mosque, rounded up worshippers and tore apart copies of the Koran on Thursday night. A spokesman for the U.S. military said he was aware of a "peaceful protest". Afghan police said any injuries had been caused by "saboteurs" in the crowd. Afghanistan has seen a series of violent protests in recent years over reports of insults to Islam. More than 74,000 foreign troops operate under NATO and U.S. military's command in Afghanistan, fighting the al Qaeda-backed Taliban. Investigation launched One of the protesters told the Associated Press that he was in the mosque when troops entered and opened fire, although no-one was injured. At least two bullets hit the door of the mosque, said Kazim Allayar, deputy provincial governor, during a visit to the site of the alleged incident. Lieutenant Commander Chris Hall said, a Nato spokesman, said they were no reports of international troops being in the area where Thursday's incident allegedly occurred. Civilian deaths Robert Rochowicz, a spokesman for Poland's defence ministry, said he had "no information at all about any kind of incident concerning Polish troops in Afghanistan".

Obama sets deadline to withdraw troops from Iraq

REUTERS/Mohammed Ameen CAMP LEJEUNE, North Carolina President Barack Obama said on Friday he would end U.S. combat operations in Iraq in 18 months but leave up to 50,000 troops there to provide stability, a decision that riled Democrats who favored a larger withdrawal. "We are leaving Iraq to its people, and we have begun the work of ending this war," Obama said in an address to Marines almost six years after U.S.-led forces toppled Saddam Hussein in a vain hunt for weapons of mass destruction. Congressional Democrats who fought the Bush administration for two years to bring home U.S. forces home expressed disappointment, with Senate leader Harry Reid saying 50,000 troops was "higher than I had anticipated" and Representative Lynn Woolsey calling it "unacceptable." "Such a large number can only be viewed by the Iraqi public as an enduring occupation force," Woolsey said. "So long as the U.S. is viewed as an occupier, the Iraqis will be unable to achieve the necessary unification, reconciliation, and further democratization efforts that will be required for them to bring long-term stability to the country." The 18-month timetable marks a historic juncture in a war that has been enormously costly to the United States and defined the presidency of George W. Bush. Winding down the Iraq war will allow Obama to boost troop numbers in Afghanistan, which he has declared the central front in the U.S. fight against terrorism. He hopes it will also help him slash a ballooning $1.3 trillion budget deficit. Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end," Obama said to scattered applause from an audience of about 2,000 Marines at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.

The BBC's Barbara Plett, in Islamabad, says accounts suggest the attack was sophisticated in nature, with one group of gunmen firing a rocket-propelled grenade in order to create a diversion, while others then approached, firing guns on the convoy.

Ten dead in Alabama shooting
(CNN) -- At least 10 people were killed Tuesday in a shooting spree that spanned two small southern Alabama towns, state officials confirmed. The gunman, who turned the gun on himself, and the wife and child of a sheriff's deputy were among those killed. An ambulance rushes to the scene of a multiple shooting in Samson, Alabama, on Tuesday afternoon. The shooting started in a neighborhood in Samson, a town of about 3,000 about 15 miles north of the Florida border, just after 4 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) and ended 12 miles away at a manufacturing plant in Geneva, said Alabama state Sen. Harri Anne Smith, who represents Geneva County. "He was shooting at just ordinary people going about their business," Smith told CNN, saying she had been briefed by state and local law enforcement. The gunman, whose identity was not disclosed, shot himself at the Reliable Metal Products plant, state public safety spokesman Kevin Cook told CNN. Authorities are also investigating an arson at a residence in neighboring Coffee County, where a body was found. That incident is thought to be related to the shootings, Cook said. Investigators are trying to determine whether the gunman, who Cook said was armed with a semi-automatic weapon, knew any of the victims. Steve Jarrett told reporters that the gunman killed six adults and one child in three residences in Samson, before heading down state Highway 52, firing at least seven bullets into a state trooper car.

I look at the door and there stands a man with a gun in his hand and he just shoots everywhere Celina Dressed in black, he starts shooting, killing nine students, eight of them female, and three teachers. Police say he aimed at his victims' heads, which suggests it was not just indiscriminate shooting. "I heard two shots and then screaming," said a student named only as Betty, 15. "At first I thought it was a joke, but then someone called "Run, run" and I saw students jumping out of the windows and took off running." "I threw myself on the floor and took my friends with me, and then I went to a corner and put a table in front of me, and he came again a second time and shot again, and we were in panic and in shock." The German Bild daily newspaper reports that the gunman enters the class a third time, asking: "Aren't you all dead?" 0933: Police receive an emergency call from a terrified pupil at the school amid scenes of panic. They can still hear shots being fired and confront the gunman on the first floor, drawing fire themselves.

Canadian helicopter with 18 onboard crashes into Atlantic Ocean
Aircraft carrying 18 people was heading to oil platform in strong winds when it plunged into water A helicopter carrying 18 people ditched in the Atlantic ocean off the Canadian coast today. The helicopter was heading to the Hibernia offshore oil platform when it went down off Newfoundland. One person was taken out of the water and ferried to hospital in an ambulance. At least one other person was spotted in the ­water, as well as a life-raft, but there is no sign of the helicopter, said Jeri Grychowski of the rescue co-ordination centre in Halifax. The S-92 Sikorsky helicopter went down 55 miles south-east of the provincial capital of St. John's, where it had picked up oil platform workers. "Mechanical problems were reported, but we don't know the nature," Julie Leroux, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, said. Grychowski said winds were fairly strong in the area, the water temperature was just above freezing and there were waves two to three metres high. "We don't have any further information on the raft itself," he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. One survivor has been plucked from the icy waters, said public broadcaster CBC, but seventeen are still missing. Two people and a raft had been spotted in the ocean waters some 47 nautical miles (54 miles) southeast of Saint Johns, Newfoundland, soon after the crash at 9.18am local time (1248 GMT), she said. The helicopter was ferrying workers to the Hibernia offshore oil platform when it plunged into the ocean, amid strong winds, she said.

Obama administration drops use of term "enemy combatant"
The Obama administration yesterday jettisoned the Bush-era term "enemy combatant" but maintained a broad right to detain those who provide "substantial" assistance to al-Qaeda and its associates around the globe. The disclosure came in a court filing by the Justice Department in response to orders by federal judges, who sought clarity on the government's legal justification for holding about 241 detainees at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Though dropping the term "enemy combatant" was a symbolic break from the Bush administration, the practical effects of yesterday's action will not be known for months. Bush administration officials had long argued they had a broad constitutional power to detain almost any terrorism suspect for an indefinite period. For those at Guantanamo, the government had said it needed to prove only that the detainees were supporting the Taliban, al-Qaeda or associated forces to justify their confinements. The Justice Department said yesterday that it would seek to hold only terrorism suspects who "substantially supported" those groups and not those who "provide unwitting or insignificant support" to al-Qaeda and the Taliban. "The particular facts and circumstances justifying detention will vary from case to case," Justice Department attorneys wrote. "Individuals who provide substantial support to al-Qaida forces in other parts of the world may properly be deemed part of al-Qaida itself," the court papers said. In a statement, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said, "[I]t is essential that we operate in a manner that strengthens our national security, is consistent with our values and is governed by law." "The change we've made today meets each of those standards and will make our nation stronger," he added.

7 killed, 50 injured in Bangladesh shopping mall fire
(Updates death toll)  By Ruma Paul and Anis Ahmed  DHAKA, March 13 A fire engulfed the top floors of Bangladesh's largest shopping mall on Friday, killing at least seven people and injuring dozens, police said, raising questions about the efficiency of safety procedures. Fire fighters, police and other security forces took almost 10 hours to put out the blaze at the 21-storey Basundhara City Complex in Dhaka but found no one trapped inside. Thick smoke rose over the building and flames could be seen on the upper floors, a witness said. Army helicopters rescued people from the roof of the building as members of the Rapid Action Battalion elite force and the army helped stop the blaze. "The fire broke out on the top floor and soon engulfed the other floors," a fire brigade official said. Television pictures showed the blaze spreading through five or six upper floors. The inferno has raised questions about the efficiency of fire fighters and whether the high-rise buildings followed required safety measures, said Tanzim Ahmed Sohel Taj, state minister for home affairs. "We will look at these issues quickly after the current disaster has been tackled," the minister told reporters outside the Basundhara complex. All the dead were Basundhara employees, one from its fire fighting unit and six were security guards, police told reporters. "The firefighter died in a hospital where he was admitted with serious burn injuries," a police officer said. A Basundhara official said the exact death toll and the extent of damage would not be known until the debris was cleared.

One-third of the Maldives' economy depends on tourism The Maldives will become carbon-neutral within a decade by switching completely to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, its leader has said. President Mohamed Nasheed told the BBC the Maldives understood better than most what would happen if the world failed to tackle climate change. His tiny country is one of the lowest-lying on Earth and so is extremely vulnerable to rises in sea level. He said he hoped his plan would serve as a blueprint for other nations. We start almost from scratch... and it is quite pointless for us to go to yesterday's technologies President Mohamed Nasheed Heightened fears for lowering lands Country profile: The Maldives Mr Nasheed was due to announce the plan formally after the screening of a new film on climate change, The Age of Stupid, on Sunday. The Maldives is made up of a chain of nearly 1,200 islands, most of them uninhabited, which lie off the Indian sub-continent. None of the coral islands measures more than 1.8 metres (six feet) above sea level, making the country vulnerable to a rise in sea levels associated with global warming. 'Starting from scratch' "We understand more than perhaps anyone what would happen to us if we didn't do anything about it or if the rest of the world doesn't find the imagination to confront this problem," Mr Nasheed told Newshour, speaking by telephone from the capital, Male. More from BBC World Service "So basically, we don't want to sit around and blame others, but we want to do whatever we can, and hopefully, if we can become carbon-neutral, and when we come up with the plan, we hope that these plans also will serve as a blueprint for other nations to follow. It is estimated that the Maldives, which has high levels of poverty, will need to spend about $110m a year to make the transition to renewable energy sources. Asked how it could afford this, the president said the country was already spending similar sums on existing energy sources, and he expected to recover the extra cost within the decade. "We start almost from scratch, we are having to go for new investments in almost all areas and it is quite pointless for us to go to yesterday's technologies," he said.

Coup in Madagascar; opposition leader backs army
The president, who was sheltering in another palace about 6 miles away, has resisted growing pressure to resign over the crisis in the Indian Ocean island in which at least 135 people have been killed. Gunfire and explosions rang out as tanks and dozens of soldiers burst into the palace grounds. Mr Rajoelina had earlier called for security forces to arrest Mr Ravalomanana, who has offered a referendum on whether he should stay. The president has been accused of misspending public funds and undermining democracy. Mr Rajoelina declared himself president of a transitional government over the weekend and promised new presidential elections within two years. Tensions have been rising on the island since late January, when the government blocked an opposition radio station's signal. Opposition supporters set fire to a building in the government broadcasting complex as well as an oil depot, a shopping mall and a private TV station linked to Mr Ravalomanana. The incident cost the president much of the support of the armed forces, which blamed him for the order to fire at demonstrators. Although Mr Ravalomanana has lost most of his power base at home, he still enjoys international legitimacy as the nation's elected president. The African Union has appealed to the rivals to negotiate amid warnings from diplomats that aid to the impoverished country is in jeopardy.

US president Obama, Congress call for blocking of executive bonuses at AIG insurance company
Senior White House officials said last night that President Obama did not learn that bonuses worth $165 million were to be paid to executives of American International Group until Thursday, one day before they were issued and two days after his Treasury secretary was informed that the payments were going forward. Obama aides defended Timothy F. Geithner's handling of the situation yesterday, with White House press secretary Robert Gibbs saying the president has "complete confidence" in the Treasury chief. In a letter to congressional leaders last night, Geithner said that in addition to pressing the company on compensation issues, the Treasury Department will deduct an amount equal to the total bonuses paid from a pledged $30 billion commitment to the troubled insurance company. As Geithner and other Obama aides continued to scramble to pull back the bonuses and calm the public furor they sparked, Congress was preparing its own remedies. In what they acknowledged would be an extraordinary move, leading Democrats proposed using the tax code to punish executives at the firm, in which the federal government controls an 80 percent stake, unless those payouts are surrendered voluntarily. Action on the legislation could begin as early as today in the Senate. That tax would also apply to future bonuses awarded, either by AIG or by other firms receiving federal aid. Similar proposals taking shape in the House would target as much as 100 percent of the bonus money, which was distributed Friday to 73 AIG employees in sums ranging from $1 million to $6.4 million, according to New York Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, who provided details of the payments -- although not the identities of specific recipients -- in a letter to House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.). The bonus scandal has inflamed lawmakers in both parties and could have broad repercussions, and lawmakers warned that it could serve as the death knell for further aid to the ailing sector. Obama's budget calls for allocating an additional $750 billion to bail out troubled firms, and his administration had hoped to quietly "wind down" operations at AIG without an excess of intervention from Congress, but both of those ambitions could be in doubt after the explosion of attention drawn by the bonuses. But they rebuked Geithner for not stopping the bonuses, and they made it clear that further requests for aid would be rejected out of hand.

Madagascar President resigns, unclear rule in Antananarivo
ADDIS ABABA The African Union warned on Tuesday it would take firm measures against Madagascar if the situation in the Indian Ocean island deteriorated and called for the constitution to be respected. "We remind (you of) our commitment to the respect of the constitutional order, especially in the succession of the president," Bruno Zidouemba, Burkina Faso's envoy to Ethiopia and the African Union, told reporters. "The AU council will be firm in the measures to be taken if the situation becomes worse than it is today. If the military takes over, it will be a coup d'etat," he said after an emergency meeting of the AU Peace and Security Council. "The council heard the succession of the presidency is being discussed in Madagascar, but we do not know the outcome." ((Jerome Delay/Associated Press)) Just hours after Madagascar's president handed over power to military leaders on Tuesday, they ceded control to his political rival. Ramaroson said he and two other top generals rejected a move by the president to transfer his power to a military directorate. Any assumption of power by non-constitutional means would be considered a coup d'etat, the union's senior diplomat, Jean Ping, told Reuters on Tuesday. Earlier on Tuesday, also in a radio address, President Marc Ravalomanana told his country he had decided to step down "after deep reflection."

REUTERS/Jim Young WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives swiftly passed a bill on Thursday to recoup controversial bonuses paid to American International Group Inc as Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner tried to calm the furor by taking responsibility. The number two Republican in the Senate, Jon Kyl of Arizona, blocked an initial bid to approve a Senate version of the legislation that would put a 70 percent excise tax on bonuses for employees at companies that have received at least $100 million in bailout aid. 'BUBBLE AND BUST' President Barack Obama urged lawmakers to press on with measures that he can sign into law, calling AIG bonuses a symptom of "a bubble and bust economy that valued reckless speculation over responsibility and hard work." Senator Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, had been scrambling to explain how a tough provision to restrict bonuses got watered down in a recently passed stimulus bill. In response to questions, Geithner said Treasury staff had expressed concern that provisions originally in the bill that would have prevented bonus payments might not survive a legal challenge. The U.S. Treasury chief, who has come under criticism for not doing more to stop the AIG bonuses, repeated he only learned "the full scale and scope of these specific bonus problems" on March 10 and conceded he was partly at fault.

New findings suggest AIG executive bonuses were larger than previously thought
The US bailed out AIG, in effect judging it too large to fail US insurance giant AIG paid out a total of $218m (£150m) in bonuses after accepting bail-out cash, according to a senior US official. Documents obtained by Connecticut's attorney general showed AIG's payout was $53m, or 32%, more than was previously estimated. Papers obtained by subpoena showed 73 people got more than $1m each while five received more than $4m. The US rescued AIG with bail-out funds totalling $170bn since September 2008. But revelations about the size of bonus payments made by the organisation since the bail-out was agreed have sparked a furious reaction among US lawmakers and the general public. 'Distasteful' For much of the week the total amount AIG paid out in bonuses was reported at $165m. But documents obtained by Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of Connecticut, now appear to raise that figure by some 32%. AIG: QUICK FACTS Founded in 1919 30 million US policy holders Operates in 130 countries Provides insurance to 100,000 companies and other entities US lawmakers vote for bonus tax AIG chief asks for bonuses back Connecticut was among 19 states demanding that AIG reveal details of bonuses paid to executives, in an effort to begin recovering the funds. AIG has made no comment on Mr Blumenthal's findings. He said the newly-revealed number would "further fuel the justified anger and revulsion that people feel", and he planned to ask AIG bosses to explain the discrepancies in bonus figures, AP reported. "Unless the number can be explained, it will undercut any lingering rationale the company may have for these unjustified payments," Mr Blumenthal said. Even AIG boss Edward Liddy - who underwent questioning by a congressional committee on the issue - has described them as "distasteful".

Plane crashes in Montana, 17 killed
The plane crashed close to the town airport A plane has crashed in the northern US state of Montana, killing at least 16 people on board, officials say. The light aircraft went down in a cemetery as it approached the airport in the town of Butte. The pilot was flying from Oroville, California, when he diverted to Butte, the FAA said. He tried to land but crashed 500ft (150m) from the airport. At a news conference, FAA officials said the plane crashed in a cemetery close to the airport in cloudy weather conditions, John Emeigh, a reporter for The Montana Standard newspaper, told the BBC. There were no survivors on board the plane, the FAA said. 'Nosedive' Reports suggest the pilot had filed a flight plan showing a destination of Bozeman, a ski destination about 85 miles (136km) southeast of Butte. But the pilot cancelled his flight plan at some point and diverted for Butte, FAA spokesman Mike Fergus said. "We think that it was probably a ski trip for the kids," Mr Fergus told the Associated Press news agency.

Japanese ship escapes after pirates open fire in Somalia
TOKYO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pirates on Sunday fired on a cargo ship operated by Japan's Mitsui O.S.K. Lines in the waters 900 km east off Somalia, local media reported on Monday, citing the transport ministry. None of the 18 crew members aboard, all Philippine nationals, were wounded when pirates in two boats fired on the ship at around10:00 p.m. Tokyo time (1300 GMT), hitting the windows and ceiling of the steering room. The ship, carrying cargoes of cars en route to Mombasa, a seaport in Southeastern Kenya, got clear of the pirates some 40 minutes later. Lines (9104.T) was shot at by two pirate ships off Somalia, but none of the 18 Filipino crew were injured, the company said on Monday. The incident, which occured on Sunday, came after the Japanese government earlier this month ordered two naval vessels to join international patrols aimed at curbing pirate attacks off Somalia. [ID:nT327928] "Some windows were broken, and there was some damage to the outside of the ship, but no one was injured," a spokeswoman for Mitsui O.S.K. "After zigzagging across the sea for about 40 minutes very fast, the ship tore itself away from the boats," she added. The company said in a statement that the ship was a Cayman Islands-flagged cargo ship transporting used cars from the United Arab Emirates to Kenya. Despite the damage, the ship could operate and is currently sailing towards a safer area. (CNN) -- Pirates attacked a Japanese cargo ship off the coast of Somalia on Sunday, a Japanese Transportation Ministry official said.

Dam in Indonesia bursts, dozens killed
Advertisement A dam has burst south-west of the Indonesian capital Jakarta, killing at least 58 people. Witnesses said a "horrifying" flash flood of water up to 4m (13ft) deep engulfed hundreds of homes in Cirendeu in the Tangerang district. Officials say they expect the death toll to rise, and 150 body bags have been sent to the scene. An official said the Situ Gintung lake behind the dam became overloaded after hours of heavy rain. "The dam was an old dam, 16m (52ft) deep," said Ratu Atut Chosiyah, governor of Banten province, where the lake is located. "Last night, because of heavy rain, the dam could not hold back the water so it broke," she added. Thick mud is hampering rescue teams, but the waters have now begun to recede. 'Still sleeping' The incident happened at about 0200 local time (1900 GMT) in what is a popular tourist area. A surge of water laden with debris slammed into the suburb of small, poorly built houses, sweeping away cars and toppling telephone lines. In pictures: Dam burst Dam burst felt 'like tsunami hit' "People were still sleeping and couldn't do anything," local official Danang Susanto told the AFP news agency. "Many people are still trapped and the rescue is ongoing." Indonesia's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono sent his condolences to the families of the victims and officials said he was planning to travel to the scene of the disaster later in the day.

UN agency condemns new Afghan "Shia family law"
Afghanistan's President, Hamid Karzai, has signed a law which "legalises" rape, women's groups and the United Nations warn. Critics claim the president helped rush the bill through parliament in a bid to appease Islamic fundamentalists ahead of elections in August. In a massive blow for women's rights, the new Shia Family Law negates the need for sexual consent between married couples, tacitly approves child marriage and restricts a woman's right to leave the home, according to UN papers seen by The Independent. "It is one of the worst bills passed by the parliament this century," fumed Shinkai Karokhail, a woman MP who campaigned against the legislation. "Karzai is in a hurry to appease the Shia because the elections are on the way." The provisions are reminiscent of the hardline Taliban regime, which banned women from leaving their homes without a male relative. The bill lay dormant for more than a year, but in February it was rushed through parliament as President Karzai sought allies in a constitutional row over the upcoming election. "They accused me of being an unbeliever," she said.

Asian countries call for global currency
A single clause in Point 19 of the communiqué issued by the G20 leaders amounts to revolution in the global financial order. "We have agreed to support a general SDR allocation which will inject $250bn (£170bn) into the world economy and increase global liquidity," it said. SDRs are Special Drawing Rights, a synthetic paper currency issued by the International Monetary Fund that has lain dormant for half a century. In effect, the G20 leaders have activated the IMF's power to create money and begin global "quantitative easing". Its fighting fund for crises is to be tripled overnight to $750bn. Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the managing director, said in February that the world was "already in Depression" and risked a slide into social disorder and military conflict unless political leaders resorted to massive stimulus. While Gordon Brown talked of $5 trillion in global stimulus by 2010, this is mostly made up of packages already under way.

13 killed in U.S. air strike in Pakistan
A suspected US missile strike in north-west Pakistan, the second drone attack in four days, has killed 13 people. Local officials in North Waziristan, near the Afghan border, said the dead included women and children as well as militants - some of them foreigners. The US military does not routinely confirm drone attacks, but US forces in Afghanistan are believed to be the only ones in the region with the capability. Pakistan is critical of drone use because, it says, civilians are often killed, fuelling support for militants. Retaliation threatened Local administration officials say the missiles destroyed part of a house owned by a school teacher in a village near the region's main town of Miranshah. A number of foreign militants were among those killed in the strike at 0300 local (2200 Friday), security officials said. Dozens of suspected drone strikes have killed hundreds in recent months The spokesman said the Taleban held Pakistan responsible for the strike, adding that it should be ready for retaliation. The latest incident comes only three days after a missile fired by a suspected US drone killed at least 14 people in Pakistan's Orakzai tribal area, near the Afghan border.

North Korea launches rocket
North Korea's neighbours have strongly condemned the rocket launch North Korea has defied international warnings and gone ahead with a controversial rocket launch. State media said a satellite had been put into orbit and was transmitting data and revolutionary songs. But there has been no independent confirmation so far. The US, Japan and South Korea suspect the launch was a cover for a long-range missile test. They strongly condemned the launch. The US president told Pyongyang to "refrain from further provocative actions". "This provocation underscores the need for action - not just this afternoon at the UN Security Council, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons." Japan called the move "extremely regrettable", while South Korea said it constituted a clear breach of a United Nations resolution. China and Russia both called on all sides to act with restraint, while the UK urged North Korea to immediately halt all missile-related activity. The UN Security Council has approved a Japanese request for an emergency session. Washington, Tokyo and Seoul regard the launch as a clear violation of Security Council resolution 1718 adopted in October 2006, which bans North Korea from carrying out ballistic missile activity. No intercept North Korea announced several weeks ago that it planned to send what it called an "experimental communications satellite" into space from the Musudan-ri launch site in the north-east.

18-year US media ban on covering return of fallen soldiers lifted
For the first time since the Obama administration reversed an 18-year-old ban on news coverage of returning fallen soldiers, the military allowed media to cover the arrival tonight of an airman killed in Afghanistan. Phillip A. Myers, a 30-year-old supporting Operation Enduring Freedom, at Dover Air Force Base at 11 p.m. today marked the first time that the transfer of any of the nearly 5,000 U.S. troops who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan was open to the media. Play The transfer of the flag-draped casket was carried out with great dignity, for the seven family members present. One of the men present dabbed his eyes with a tissue. After a prayer was said by a chaplain, Maj. Klabens Noel, a carry team of eight airmen and women wearing battle dress uniforms with white gloves moved Myers' flag-draped casket from an Atlas Air 747 cargo jet to a waiting panel truck. In the cool night, under a light breeze, the only noise was the hum of the jet's auxiliary power unit, until the quiet was pierced by the engine of the lift lowering the casket from the jet to the tarmac. The eight airmen and women carried the casket to a white panel truck, placed it inside, as the doors were slowly closed, the call went out for present arms. About 40 members of the media were present, and throughout the transfer there were no flashes, no talking, though cameras clicked as casket went by.

5.6-magnitude aftershock earthquake strikes Italy
Rescuers continued searching for survivors though the night after a powerful aftershock brought two apartment blocks crashing down in the stricken city of L'Aquila, killing one person and causing panic among rescue workers and survivors of Monday's deadly earthquake. Chunks of masonry fell from other damaged buildings, including parts of the basilica, and the tremor - measured by the US Geological Survey at magnitude 5.6 - was felt as far away as Rome. Within minutes the city resounded again to the scream of sirens as police and rescue workers rushed to the scene. Meanwhile, rescue workers were preparing to carry out what one called a "surgical operation" on a collapsed building in the centre of L'Aquila in the hope of saving the lives of four missing students as the overall death toll reached at least 235. Sergio Basti, the Rome fire brigade engineer leading the attempt, said his team aimed to demolish the residence where the students were trapped "bit by bit from the top, like scraping toppings from a pizza". The students' residence has been a focus of the rescue operation since early on Monday, shortly after the earthquake that devastated the city and several of the surrounding towns and villages. But Basti warned: "We do not know whether they are dead or alive." The relatives had spent much of the day waiting anxiously, and sometimes tearfully, outside the building among reporters, police and firefighters. Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, told a press conference in L'Aquila that the search for the living would go on for another 48 hours.

Election in Moldova instigates rioting mob demanding recount
Some of those protesting on Tuesday bore the Romanian flag Moldova's president has accused neighbouring Romania of stoking the protests that erupted into violence in the capital Chisinau on Tuesday. Romania has rejected the accusation as a "provocation". Thousands of young protesters thronged Chisinau, fighting police and ransacking parliament, in protest at the results of Sunday's election. Official results gave the ruling Communists about 50% of the vote in the Romanian-speaking ex-Soviet republic. International observers said the vote appeared to have been fair, though one told the BBC she had her doubts.

Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin, a Communist, was quoted by Russian agency Interfax saying: "We know that certain political forces in Romania are behind this unrest. He ordered that Romania's ambassador be expelled, recalled the Moldovan envoy from Bucharest, and said Romanians would in future need visas to cross into Moldova. Earlier the president described the violence as "a coup d'etat". Some of the protesters on Tuesday had carried Romanian flags and called for the unification of Moldova with Romania, its bigger neighbour. Russia's foreign ministry said there was a plot aimed at undermining "the sovereignty of Moldova". But Romania's foreign ministry said: "This accusation is a provocation aimed at the Romanian state."

American captain freed from Somali pirates
In a daring high-seas rescue, U.S. Navy SEAL snipers killed three Somali pirates and freed the American sea captain who had offered himself as a hostage to save his crew. The operation was a victory for the world's most powerful military but angry pirates vowed Monday to retaliate. Those threats raised fears for the safety of some 230 foreign sailors still held hostage in more than a dozen ships anchored off the coast of lawless Somalia. "From now on, if we capture foreign ships and their respective countries try to attack us, we will kill them (the hostages)," Jamac Habeb, a 30-year-old pirate, told the Associated Press from one of Somalia's piracy hubs, Eyl. "(U.S. forces have) become our No. Richard Phillips' rescue caused his crew in Kenya to break into wild cheers and brought tears to the eyes of those in Phillips' hometown of Underhill, Vt., half a world away from the Indian Ocean drama. A statement from Phillips' wife Andrea was read at a news conference in Vermont on Monday. She said she is proud of her husband and thanks everyone for giving her "the strength to be strong for Richard." In a sharp warning to pirates off Somalia, Obama added: "I want to be very clear that we are resolved to halt the rise of piracy in that region and to achieve that goal, we're going to have to continue to work with our partners to prevent future attacks." "We have to continue to be prepared to confront them when they arise, and we have to ensure that those who commit acts of piracy are held accountable for their crimes," the president said.

Peruvian rebels kill thirteen soldiers
The army has been pursuing rebels in the Ayacucho region Peru's Shining Path rebels have killed 13 soldiers in two ambushes in the south-east of the country, the country's defence minister says. Antero Flores Araoz said the rebels had used dynamite and grenades to attack one military patrol on Thursday. A captain and 11 soldiers died in that attack which left two other soldiers wounded and one is still missing. It is one of the deadliest operations by the once-formidable guerrillas in the past decade. Mr Flores said the incidents had taken place on Thursday, but news had been delayed by poor communications with the region. Prime Minister Yehude Simon condemned the ambushes as "desperate responses by the Shining Path in the face of advances by the armed forces". "I have no doubt that in the next years this zone will be free of leftover terrorists," he added. Last year, the Shining Path sprang back from relative obscurity to launch a series of deadly attacks, killing some 25 soldiers and police officers in ambushes and gun battles. But the group is believed to be a fraction of its former size and is split between two cocaine-producing zones of Peru, some 500km (310 miles) apart. It is made up of a few hundred guerrillas who did not lay down their arms when the group's leader, Abimael Guzman, declared the armed revolution at an end after his capture in 1992. Its fighters are considered expert in guerrilla warfare from years of resistance in some of Peru's remotest and wildest country and are well-armed from the profits of the cocaine trade.

Afghanistan women protest Shia Family Law
Women marching against new legislation which effectively legalises rape met violent opposition from an opposing mob in Kabul yesterday. Dozens of riot police, backed by more than 50 elite counter-terrorism officers, struggled to keep the groups apart as hordes of men charged at the protesters, who had taken to the streets near Afghanistan's parliament. At one point the women , who were marching to parliament to deliver a petition, were pelted with stones. Men chanted "long live Islam" and spat at the women who had assembled outside a mosque built by Ayatollah Mohseni, the Shia cleric who helped draft the law. At a separate demonstration, police fired into the air to disperse a mob surrounding a school accused of organising the protests. The legislation restricts a woman's right to leave her home and demands she submit to her husband's sexual desires. Sima Ghani, one of the women's organisers, said: "This law is against Islam and it's against women. Most of those protesting against the law were young Shia women who took to the streets despite the threat of violence. The UN has warned that a number of women have already received death threats for speaking out against the Shia Family Law, which President Hamid Karzai signed last month. "But these men are claiming those rights in the name of culture.

The attack was condemned as a "cowardly act of terrorism" in a statement from the office of Yousuf Raza Gilani, the prime minister, which added that the government would use an "iron hand" against opposition fighters. The checkpoint is near the Orakzai tribal region in Pakistan, which has emerged in recent months as stronghold for pro-Taliban fighters who have stepped up their battle against the government. Western nations are pressing Pakistan to take greater action against pro-Taliban forces and al-Qaeda elements in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan.

Scientist Stephen Hawking rushed to hospital in ambulance
Professor Stephen Hawking, one of the world's most famous scientists, is "very ill" in hospital, Cambridge University said today. Professor Hawking, who works at the university, was undergoing tests at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. A university spokesman said the 67-year-old physicist, who is best known for his book A Brief History of Time, was taken to Addenbrooke's by ambulance. "Professor Hawking is very ill," he added. Professor Hawking suffers from motor neurone disease and is wheelchair bound. He speaks with the help of a voice synthesiser. He developed symptoms of the disease while studying in the 1960s and is one of the world's longest surviving sufferers. He has worked at Cambridge's Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics for more than 30 years and since 1979 has been the University's Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. Professor Hawking was awarded a CBE in 1982, became a Companion of Honour in 1989 and is a Fellow of the Royal Society. He studied at St Albans School before reading physics at University College Oxford then moving to Cambridge to carry out research in cosmology. One of Professor Hawking's last public appearances was last September when he unveiled a £1 million clock erected at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. "Professor Hawking is very ill and has today been taken by ambulance to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge," said the University spokesman.

Darling announces UK budget for 2009
Critics say that the chancellor is being over-optimistic in his anticipation that the economy would grow by 3.5% in 2011 and continue to grow at 3%-plus in the next two years. City economists poured scorn on Treasury forecasts that Britain will rapidly bounce back from its weakest one-year performance since 1945 to record a sustained period of rapid growth from 2011. Despite being forced to downgrade his growth expectations for this year to show a 3.5% drop in gross domestic product, Alistair Darling said he expected the UK to start expanding again by the end of the year and record a 1.25% expansion next year. But the chancellor was accused of being over-optimistic in his anticipation that a mini-investment boom and the boost to exports from a weaker pound would lead to growth of 3.5% in 2011 and continue to grow at 3%-plus in the next two years. Darling told MPs that the 1.6% contraction in the economy in the final three months of 2008 would be repeated in the first quarter of 2009. GDP is expected to decline at an annual rate of 4% in the first half of this year but the chancellor said the recession had done little long-term damage to the economy, which would eventually return to a trend rate of growth of 2.75%. Nick Parsons, head of strategy at NAB Capital said: "These numbers are astonishing for growth. They are totally unrealistic, both because lower levels of consumption by both businesses and individuals will reduce the trend rate of growth and because it is highly unlikely that the economy could grow above trend for so long. It is the growth forecasts that allow him to get the budget deficit and debt down." Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said: "We believe that these forecasts are mildly optimistic in the near term and much more optimistic in the long term."

Four bombings over two days leave more than 130 dead in Iraq
The two attacks killed nearly 100 people and left dozens more wounded [EPA] The blast in central Baghdad took place as a group of policemen were distributing relief supplies to Iraqis who had been driven from their homes during the sectarian bloodshed that followed the 2003 US-led invasion. "It is a suicide bomber. Obviously that has the fingerprints of al-Qaeda," Major-General Qassim Moussawi, a Baghdad security spokesman, said. A medic at the nearby Ibn al-Nafis hospital said that five children and a woman were confirmed dead at the hospital. Pilgrims targeted Christopher Hill, right, takes up his new posting amid increasing violence in Iraq [Reuters] The second attack occurred near Muqdadiya, 80km from Baghdad, in the northeastern province of Diyala. The suicide bomber appeared to have targeted a group of Iranian pilgrims in a restaurant. Most of the 64 dead are believed to be Iranians visiting Shia Muslim religious sites in Iraq, police said. More than 60 others were wounded. The attacks were the latest in a series of bombings that have raised fears of a surge in violence as the US military plans for a full withdrawal by the end of 2011. Security has improved measurably in Iraq over the past two years, but attacks targeting the police are still common in some parts of the country, including the capital. Security experts have previously speculated that al-Baghdadi was a character invented by some extremist groups rather than a real person. The group is one of a handful of Sunni Arab groups blamed for suicide bombings and other attacks in the northern city of Mosul and other parts of Iraq.

Outbreak of swine flu in Mexico kills at least twenty, infects 1,000
Scores of public buildings were closed in Mexico City in a bid to contain the illness [AFP] Scores of public buildings were closed in Mexico City in a bid to contain the illness [AFP] Initial reports from the WHO said that up to 60 people had died in Mexico from the disease, and Cordova said 40 deaths were being "analysed" for the disease. US officials said the White House was closely following the outbreak in the United States and Barack Obama, the president, has been informed. The officials said the virus in the United States was a never-before-seen mixture of viruses typical among pigs, birds and humans. Armando Ahued, Mexico City's health minister, said a massive vaccination campaign was being launched against the illness. Al Jazeera's Franc Contreras in Mexico City said the authorities had advised people not to go outside unless necessary and that many residents had bought surgical masks in attempt to avoid the disease. Pandemic fears The WHO, which has identified swine influenza as a potential source of a human flu pandemic, said it had activated its global epidemic operations centre, which oversees acute public health events in response to the crisis. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said the A/H1N1 influenza identified in at least two of the recent cases by US counterparts could develop into a pandemic-type virus. Human outbreaks of H1N1 swine influenza virus were recorded in the US in 1976 and 1988, when two deaths were recorded, and also in 1986, while in 1988 a pregnant woman died after contact with sick pigs, the WHO said. In recent years the global focus for a possible pandemic has shifted to the H5N1 bird flu virus, which has spread from poultry to humans and killed 257 of the 421 people infected by the virus since 2003.

At least 71 deaths in Mexico 'likely linked' to swine flu outbreak
Without that knowledge — which is unlikely to emerge soon because only two laboratories, in Atlanta and Winnipeg, Canada, can confirm a case — his agency’s panel of experts was unwilling to raise the global pandemic alert level, even though it officially saw the outbreak as a public health emergency and opened its emergency response center. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As a news conference in Washington, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano called the emergency declaration “standard operating procedure,” and said she would rather call it a “declaration of emergency preparedness.” “It’s like declaring one for a hurricane,” she said. “It means we can release funds and take other measures. The hurricane may not actually hit.” American investigators said they expected more cases here, but noted that virtually all so far had been mild and urged Americans not to panic.

Icelandic centre-left coalition secures majority in parliamentary elections
A leftwing coalition won Iceland's general election, according to final results released today. The results were an overwhelming rejection of the pro-business Independence party that many blamed for the collapse of the country's banking system. Results showed that the leftwing coalition made up of the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left Green Movement won 34 out of 63 parliamentary seats. All five constituencies completed the count with 97.9% of the votes tallied. Both parties have long said they will form a coalition government. The two parties formed part of a caretaker government that took office in February after public protests about Iceland's economic collapse toppled the previous conservative administration. Voter turnout was just over 85%, slightly higher than in the 2007 elections. Although it won 23.7% of the vote, many blamed its leaders for the country's economic troubles. After racking up massive debts during years of laissez-faire economic regulation and rapid expansion, Iceland's three main banks collapsed within the space of a week in October. Unemployment and inflation have spiralled and the IMF has predicted that the economy will shrink by about 10% in 2009, which would be Iceland's biggest slump since it won full independence from Denmark in 1944.

French tourists killed in California bus rollover accident
A tour bus carrying French travellers crashed on a highway overpass in the central California city of Soledad on Tuesday, killing at least five people and injuring dozens, police said. The afternoon crash occurred on Highway 101, California Highway Patrol said. A total of 36 people had been on board, including 34 French tourists, one Canadian tour guide and an American driver, California Highway Patrol spokesman Brian Wiest said. The crash ejected four passengers from the vehicle, sending one over the side of the road and onto railroad tracks about 20 metres below, Wiest said. Maia Carroll, a spokeswoman for the Monterey County Office of Emergency Services, said there were at least five confirmed deaths — three at the scene, including the passenger who fell to the railroad tracks, and two who later died at hospitals. Authorities haven't released the names of the deceased or injured people. She said the hospital had been told to expect more patients. The Orion Pacific bus was left lying on its side, while luggage and clothing were strewn across the road. "At this time, it appears to just be a solo-vehicle incident, meaning just the tour bus itself was involved," Wiest said. The French consulate in San Francisco confirmed it had been told travellers from France were on board, but it didn't have any more details.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter to retire
Supreme Court Justice David Souter poses for an official picture with other justices at the Supreme Court, October 31, 2005. REUTERS/Jason Reed WASHINGTON U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter announced on Friday he will resign, and President Barack Obama said he wanted someone with a sharp, independent mind for his first appointment to the nation's highest court. Souter, 69, who has been on the court since 1990, said in a brief letter to the White House that he intended to retire when the justices go on their summer recess at the end of next month. Minutes later, Obama made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room after speaking to Souter and said: "I am incredibly grateful for his dedicated service. I told him as much when we spoke." Souter's retirement plans, which leaked out late on Thursday, sparked a frenzy of speculation about Obama's search for a replacement, although the transition is unlikely to change the nine-member court's ideological balance. Souter usually sides with the court's three other liberal justices. I will seek someone who understands that justice isn't just about some abstract legal theory or footnote in a casebook," Obama said. And it is my hope we can swear in our new Supreme Court justice in time for him or her to be seated by the first Monday in October when the court's new term begins," Obama said.

Swine flu worldwide: update
Advertisement About 300 people at a Hong Kong hotel have been placed under quarantine after a guest there became China's first confirmed swine flu case. The 25-year-old man, who is now in hospital after testing positive for the virus, had travelled from Mexico via Shanghai, Hong Kong's leader said. Local TV footage showed police wearing masks guarding the hotel exits. Meanwhile, the UK joined Canada, Spain, Germany and the US in reporting person-to-person transmission of the virus. On Friday, French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot said two people were infected with swine flu, France's first confirmed cases. South Korea has also confirmed its first case, local media said. The announcements take to 16 the number of countries where swine flu has been confirmed. Mexico, where the outbreak began, has shut down parts of its economy for five days in a bid to curb the virus's progress. Late on Friday, Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova announced the confirmed death toll from the virus had risen by one, to 16. "The mortality rate isn't as great as could be expected," said Mr Cordova. "The majority of the deaths are women." Mexican officials say the spread of swine flu - suspected in more than 380 deaths - is slowing. International experts are more cautious - but one, Nancy Cox, chief of America's Center for Disease Control's influenza division, said the new virus lacked the traits that made the 1918 pandemic so deadly.

Increased turnout, reports of violence at worldwide May Day demonstrations
There were also clashes in Hamburg, where anti-capitalist protesters attacked a bank. In Turkey, masked protesters threw stones and petrol bombs at police, smashing banks and supermarket windows in its biggest city, Istanbul. Security forces fired tear gas and water cannon at hundreds of rioters and more than a hundred were arrested with dozens more hurt. There were also scattered skirmishes with police in the capital, Ankara, where 150,000 people marched. The government had declared May Day, traditionally marked by rallies by labour unions, a public holiday this year under pressure from unions. In Greece, officers fired flash grenades to disperse rioters in Athens after attacks on banks and traffic cameras. Transport strikes disrupted bus, train and ferry services as well as flights by Greek carrier Olympic Airlines. Twenty people were injured and five arrested after police clashed with demonstrators at a traditional labour day rally in Linz in northern Austria. In France, unions joined forces for the first time since the Second World War, but turnout was not as high as a protest day in March in which up to three million attended 300 rallies against President Nicolas Sarkozy's economic recovery plan. Some politicians have warned of the threat of "revolution", following radical action such as "boss-napping" factory executives and an ongoing strike that has crippled dozens of French universities. They are wary of the growing power of leftist radicals linked to the New Anti-Capitalist Party of Olivier Besancenot, a Trotskyist postman. There were also marches in big cities in Spain, burdened with the highest unemployment rate in Europe.

Rights group in Afghanistan investigating claim of US use of phosphorus bombs
The US military says its only uses white phosphorous within legal bounds The US military says it has evidence that insurgents in Afghanistan have illegally used white phosphorus ammunition to attack its forces. A military spokesman, Col Greg Julian, said at least 44 incidents of Taleban militants using or storing the weapons had been documented. White phosphorus is allowed in battle to illuminate targets. But it causes severe chemical burns on flesh and cannot legally be used as a weapon against people. A senior doctor, Dr Mohammad Aref Jalali, suggested the chemical might have been used in recent clashes in Farah province between US-led forces and Taleban militants. The US has strongly denied using white phosphorous in Farah province and the spokesman accused the insurgents of blatantly violating the laws of war. 'Unusual' burns "The insurgents possess and use white phosphorus as a weapon against people," said Col Julian. Dr Jalali, head of the burns unit at the Herat Regional Hospital, said they had treated a number of people injured in the clashes in Farah who had what he called unusual burns. The burns appeared to have been caused by a chemical used in a bomb: "The presence of phosphorus is not confirmed, but I see it as probability.

American journalist in Iran freed from prison
Advertisement The US-Iranian journalist jailed in Iran, Roxana Saberi, has been freed from prison after having her sentence for spying reduced. Lawyers for Ms Saberi, 31, whose imprisoning sparked a global outcry, said she left Tehran's Evin jail hours after her eight-year term was cut. She will be able to leave the country but has been banned from working as a journalist in Iran for five years. The White House welcomed the release as a "humanitarian gesture". Ms Saberi was convicted of spying for the US in April but denied the charge. The BBC's Tehran correspondent says the charge against her was reduced on appeal to one carrying a lesser sentence. The case sparked international attention and protests calling for Roxana Saberi to be released. US President Barack Obama, who has taken a more conciliatory approach to Iran than his predecessor, was among those who appealed on her behalf. "He was relieved to see that Roxana Saberi has been released," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters. "We know this has been a trying time for her family and friends and he looks forward to welcoming her home to the United States. We want to continue to stress that she was wrongly accused but we welcome this humanitarian gesture."

North Korea conducts test of nuclear weapon
SEOUL, May 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will prevent its civilians from visiting the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, excluding the Kaesong Joint Complex, for safety reasons, starting from Tuesday, the nation's unification ministry said Monday. Unification ministry spokesperson Chun Hae-sung said, "Visits to the North (DPRK) will be banned for the time being due to safety concerns as the country has conducted a nuclear test." South Koreans will be prevented from traveling to the areas near Pyongyang, the DPRK's capital city, and the Mount Kumgang, starting from Tuesday, the spokesperson said. However, people heading for Kaesong for business purposes will still be allowed to cross the border as the Kaesong Joint Complex is still open amid the current political tension, the spokesperson added. The businesses to engage in inter-Korean trades are accordingly expected to be hurt by the ministry's ban, local media reported. The move came as South Korea's presidential office reported it has detected an "artificial earthquake" in the DPRK, later confirmed by the DPRK as its second nuclear test. The DPRK has recently threatened to conduct another nuclear test after the U.N. Security Council announced in a statement condemning the April 5 rocket launch. ・DPRK said Monday it has successfully conducted "one more" underground nuclear test. ・DPRK: test was "part of the measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defence..." ・The statement did not give any details about the test, including its location.

Trial against Church of Scientology begins in France
By John Lichfield The Scientology movement went on trial in Paris yesterday for "organised fraud" in a case which could lead to the cult's organising bodies being outlawed in France. The French state prosecution service has failed to back the trial but denies that its decision was influenced by the lobbying of French politicians, including Nicolas Sarkozy before he became President, by leading Scientologists, including the actor Tom Cruise. After an 11-year inquiry, following complaints from four French former Scientologists, an independent, investigating magistrate decided that the prosecution should go ahead. Two female plaintiffs allege that, between 1997 and 1999, the French movement persuaded them to pay the equivalent of €20,000 each on drugs, vitamins, counselling, saunas and equipment to improve their mental and physical health. This included an "electrometer" to measure the state of their "spiritual condition". The movement is accused of pretending to "identify and resolve alleged psychological difficulties" and "promoting the personal flowering" of its adepts with the "sole aim of seizing their resources" and "establishing psychological control over them". Although individual Scientologists, including the cult's founder, L Ron Hubbard, have previously been convicted in France, this is the first time that the movement itself has been accused in a French court of systematic criminal activity. Scientology, officially accepted as a religion in the United States, is on trial for "escroquerie en bande organisee" - or organised financial fraud. It is also accused of dispensing drugs illegally to its members. If convicted after a two or three-week trial, the main French organisations of the movement could be ordered to close down.

"We will thoroughly examine her record to ensure she understands that the role of a jurist in our democracy is to apply the law even-handedly, despite their own feelings or personal or political preferences," he said.

Iran hangs three suspects for mosque bombing, blames U.S. and Israel
TEHRAN Iran executed in public on Saturday three men convicted of involvement in a bomb attack on a mosque that killed 25 people, the official IRNA news agency reported. The bombing in a crowded Shi'ite mosque on Thursday evening wounded more than 120 people in the southeastern city of Zahedan, two weeks before a presidential election in the Islamic Republic. "Three people convicted of being involved in the recent terrorist bombing in Zahedan were hanged in public on Saturday morning," IRNA said, adding that the executions took place near the mosque where the bombing took place. A Sunni opposition group named Jundollah (God's Soldiers), which Iran says is part of the Islamist al Qaeda network and backed by the United States, said it was behind the bombing, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said on Friday. Ebrahim Hamidi, a local judiciary official, said the men were convicted after going through the normal judiciary process, adding that they were also involved in past "terrorist activities." "The bombing happened with the explosives these three convicted criminals brought to the country," Hamidi said. "They were convicted as 'mohareb' (one who wages war against God), 'corrupt on the earth' and acting against national security," he said. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned the bombing, saying "no one can doubt that the hands of ... some interfering powers and their spying services are bloodied by the blood of the innocent."

Air France jet with 228 on board goes missing
PARIS, June 1 An Air France passenger jet that went missing during a flight from Brazil to France with 228 on board would have run out of fuel by now, a senior French minister said on Monday. "By now it would be beyond its kerosene reserves so unfortunately we must now envisage the most tragic scenario," said Jean-Louis Borloo, the second most senior figure in the cabinet. Borloo told France Info radio that the plane had disappeared from military as well as civilian radar screens. Photo The disappearance of an Air France jet en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on Sunday evening left seasoned crash investigators with a mystery to plumb and very little data to work with. The Airbus A330-200, carrying 228 passengers and crew members, is believed to have vanished in a towering thunderstorm with no word from its pilots that they were in crisis. The plane had beamed out several signals that its electrical systems had malfunctioned and, according to one report, that it had lost cabin pressure. The signals were sent not as distress calls, however, but as automated reports to Air France’s maintenance system, and were not read for hours, until air traffic controllers realized that the plane’s crew had not radioed in on schedule. As a search for wreckage began over a vast swath of ocean between Brazil and the African coast, experts struggled to offer plausible theories as to how a well-maintained modern jetliner, built to withstand electrical and physical buffeting far greater than nature usually offers, could have gone down so silently and mysteriously. Whatever of the plane’s final minutes was recorded in its black box may never be known, because it is presumably at the bottom of the Atlantic. As is common with trans-ocean flights, it was too far out over the sea to be tracked on land-based radar from Brazil or Senegal. The plane, Flight AF 447, was scheduled to arrive at Charles de Gaulle airport at 11:10 a.m. local time.

Twentieth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests passes in China
No ordinary day at Tiananmen Square On the 20th anniversary of the deadly crackdown on protesters, security personnel outnumber tourists. Metal detectors under white tents dot the square, and guides advise visitors to behave. But this day is not like every other day. It is June 4, the 20th anniversary of the brutal crackdown by the army that left hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy demonstrators dead. Just like every other day, people snap pictures of themselves in front of the "Gate of Heavenly Peace" (Tiananmen, in Mandarin), where Mao proclaimed the founding of the nation in 1949. Just like every other day, they line up at the mausoleum where his body lies preserved under glass and pose next to the 10-story obelisk Monument to the People's Heroes. As the sun peeks out over the high-rises of the nearby financial district, the guards in military regalia goose-step to the flagpole for the daily ritual in front of the iconic portrait of Mao Tse-tung. The billowing red flag climbs slowly to an accompaniment of the national anthem pumped out of loudspeakers around the square. The sky is still murky with night when the hard-core convene at Tiananmen Square. Only the most patriotic Chinese and the most dedicated tourists have yanked themselves out of bed to watch the Chinese flag rising over Beijing at sunrise.

Governor of New Hampshire signs law legalizing same-sex marriages
BOSTON  The New Hampshire legislature approved revisions to a same-sex marriage bill on Wednesday, and Gov. John Lynch promptly signed the legislation, making the state the sixth to let gay couples wed. The bill had been through several permutations to satisfy Mr. Lynch and certain legislators that it would not force religious organizations that oppose same-sex marriage to participate in ceremonies celebrating it. Some groups had feared they could be sued for refusing to allow same-sex weddings on their property. Mr. Lynch, who previously supported civil unions but not marriage for same-sex couples, said in a statement that he had heard “compelling arguments that a separate system is not an equal system.” “Today,” he said, “we are standing up for the liberties of same-sex couples by making clear that they will receive the same rights, responsibilities  and respect  under New Hampshire law.” The law will take effect on Jan. 1. As originally cast, the legislation exempted members of the clergy from having to perform same-sex weddings. Then Mr. Lynch, a centrist Democrat, said he would veto the bill unless the legislature added language also exempting religious groups and their employees from having to participate in such ceremonies. Mr. Lynch also ordered that the bill protect members of religious groups from having to provide same-sex couples with religious counseling, housing designated for married people and other services relating to “the promotion of marriage.” But the House rejected that language last month by a two-vote margin, and legislative leaders appointed a committee to negotiate a compromise. The committee last week recommended changes further emphasizing the rights of religious groups not to participate. They include a preamble to the bill that states, “Each religious organization, association, or society has exclusive control over its own religious doctrine, policy, teachings and beliefs regarding who may marry within their faith.” Republicans have called the committee’s work tainted because the Senate president, Sylvia B. Larsen, a Democrat, replaced one of its Republican members when that legislator would not sign off on last week’s compromise. As more states have legalized same-sex marriage, opponents have increasingly lobbied for “conscience protections,” language that exempts religious organizations from having to participate. But many of the bill’s opponents believe the language adopted by New Hampshire and several other states does not go far enough because it protects only religious groups and their employees. New Hampshire’s bill does not exempt photographers or florists, for example, from having to provide services. But groups that advocate for gay rights, some of whom poured money into the state in recent months, said the law was yet another step toward mainstream America accepting same-sex marriage.

Palestinian protester killed by Israeli soldiers
Activists protesting against the separation barrier have clashed with soldiers in Nilin since 2007 [AFP] Witnesses said Israeli troops fired tear gas, rubber bullets and possibly live rounds at rock-throwing demonstrators in the village. Another protester, aged 15, was wounded by the Israeli forces, the medics said. Ruling ignored About 200 people, including Israeli and foreign activists as well as Palestinians, took part in the demonstration. Activists protesting against Israel's construction of the West Bank barrier have clashed with soldiers nearly every Friday outside Nilin and nearby Bilin for more than two years. Israel says the projected 723km of steel and concrete walls, fences and barbed wire is needed for security. The Palestinians view it as a land grab that undermines their right to a state. To date Israel has built 57 per cent of the projected barrier, most of it inside the occupied West Bank. The International Court of Justice issued a non-binding resolution in 2004 calling for parts of the barrier inside the West Bank to be torn down and for further construction in the occupied territory to cease. RAMALLAH, West Bank, June 5 Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian man on Friday in a confrontation with stone-throwing protesters in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian hospital officials said. Medics said Aqel Srour, 35, was hit in the chest by a live bullet and another protester was wounded when soldiers fired at protesters in Nilin, a village near the city of Ramallah. Srour died minutes later, Mohammed Shahwan, a doctor on the ambulance called to the scene, told Reuters. Nilin is the scene of weekly protests against the continuing construction of an Israeli barrier that has cut through the village. Israel says the barrier it has built along its boundary with the West Bank, territory it captured in a 1967 war, is needed to keep bombers from infiltrating its towns.

"And I would have thought we're not at the halfway point, given that we still don't have an extensive spread in Australia," she said. "We are only part way, but closer, to having a vaccine and we are still prepared to put all our efforts into containing the disease as much as possible." Ms Roxon says doctors and hospitals around the country will begin randomly sampling flu patients to monitor the spread of human swine flu. "It gives us the tools to monitor how much of the flu in the coming weeks is seasonal flu, how much is actually this H1N1 strain, and we will simply have to keep monitoring that over the coming months," she said. "This is a time to be cautious, where the combination of the flus might turn it into something much less virulent or something more virulent." Several states have told children who have been to Victoria to stay at home for a week. Several other schools around the country have been closed to fight the spread of the virus.

Gunman kills one at Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.
At 12:40 p.m. yesterday a man stepped through the doors of the U.S. He took two paces, lowered his rifle at a security guard and, before anyone could react, opened fire in a popular national landmark. The guard, who did not have time to draw his gun, fell bleeding and fatally wounded to the polished floor. Other guards fired back, cutting down the assailant. And what moments before had been a bright weekday in June became a tableau of violence. As described by bystanders and authorities, the attack inside the famed Holocaust museum turned the crowded building and Washington's nearby tourist-thronged Mall into a scene of fear and chaos, with black-clad SWAT teams, hovering helicopters and racing emergency vehicles. Stunned witnesses described a fusillade of gunfire -- five shots or more -- the blood-streaked floor and the screams of frightened visitors inside the museum and on the street. "It's like a scene from a movie," said Edward Bhopa, 54. The suspect, identified by law enforcement sources as James W. von Brunn, 88, of Annapolis, was said to be a longtime, "hard-core" supremacist whose Internet writings contain extensive, poisonous ravings against Jews and African Americans. The slain guard, Stephen T. Johns, 39, of Temple Hills, worked for the Wackenhut security company and had been employed at the museum for six years, the museum said. Officials at George Washington University Hospital, where von Brunn, Johns and an unidentified victim with less serious injuries were taken, said Johns suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and died there. Von Brunn was shot in the face, and the bullet exited his neck, according to a high-ranking police source.

Swine flu claims first UK victim
Ms Fleming had health problems before contracting the flu virus The family of the first person in Europe to die after being diagnosed with swine flu has suffered a double tragedy with the death of her baby. Jacqueline Fleming, 38, from Glasgow, died on Sunday at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. Her son Jack, who was born 11 weeks early, died on Monday in a special care baby unit at the same hospital. The baby was not infected with the Influenza A (H1N1) virus. Ms Fleming had been suffering from underlying health problems since the birth of her son. In a statement, her partner William McCann said it was an extremely distressing and difficult time for the family. He said: "My beautiful son was born on the first of June 2009, 11 weeks early. "He suffered from a number of complications and despite his brave fight he passed away earlier this evening at the Special Care Baby Unit at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley." She was a really nice lady, really kind, a quiet woman, just a family person really Family friend Ms Fleming lived with her two other children - one aged 18 and one of primary school age - and her long-term partner in the family home in Thornliebank, just south of Glasgow.

Militants kill at least 21 Algerian police in ambush
The ambush was not immediately confirmed by the Algerian authorities but a vast security operation has been launched in the region. Rise in violence The government of Algeria, a major oil and gas producer, has struggled for nearly two decades to combat fighters who now operate under al-Qaeda's banner. In recent weeks there has been a rise in violence across the country. In late May fighters killed five paramilitary gendarmes and a week later shot dead nine soldiers. Violence began in Algeria in 1992 when a military-backed government scrapped elections that a radical Islamic party was poised to win. ALGIERS, Algeria, June 18 (UPI) -- The killing of some 20 Algerian paramilitary policemen in a desert ambush Wednesday by Islamist extremists linked to al-Qaida was a show of force by the jihadists who appear determined to expand their operations across the region and open a new terror front. It was formerly known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, one of the most vicious Islamist groups to emerge from Algeria's civil war throughout the 1990s. The group has a hard core of an estimated 500 to 800 fighters, a fraction of the tens of thousands active during the war between Islamists and the military-backed regime in Algiers, in which an estimated 200,000 people perished. But its alliance with Osama bin Laden has meant it has acquired seasoned fighters from other al-Qaida affiliates, many of them veterans of the insurgencies in Iraq, Afghanistan and more recently Pakistan. Arab and Western intelligence sources are convinced that al-Qaida in the Maghreb is seeking an operational alliance with other jihadist groups in Morocco, Tunisia and Libya.

Tensions rise between North Korea and United States
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. military is tracking a North Korean ship believed to be carrying illicit weapons or technology, a senior U.S. official said Thursday. The Kang Nam is known for having carried "proliferation materials," a senior U.S. official says. The ship, the Kang Nam, is a North Korean-flagged ship, according to two senior U.S. officials, and is currently in the Pacific. While the United States does not know what specifically is on the ship, the Kang Nam is a "repeat offender," known for having carried "proliferation materials," one senior defense official said. Without speaking to any details of the Kang Nam report, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the United States would not forcibly board a North Korean ship but, in accordance with the recent United Nations resolution, would request permission to search the ship or press any port the ship docks in to inspect it for illegal materials. Mullen told reporters at a news conference that neither the United States nor any other navy would board a ship without permission. "The United Nations Security Council resolution does not include an option for opposed-boarding or noncompliant boarding with respect to that," he said. "To further isolate itself, to further noncomply with international guidance and regulations in the long run puts them in a more difficult position," Mullen said. The US is "in a good position" to protect its territory from a potential North Korean missile strike, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has said.

Mr Miliband said: "This is a very distressing development. "We have never speculated on the outcome of this case although we have been working intensively on it, so the overriding feeling today is one of deep sadness and fear." He said forensic examinations are under way to establish the identities of the bodies and how they died. "Our immediate thoughts are clearly with the families of the five Britons taken hostage in Baghdad in May 2007," he said. "This is terrible moment of uncertainty and fear for them."

Alzheimer's disease reversed in mice using caffeine
MIAMI, July 6 (UPI) -- Memory impairment was reversed in aged mice, bred to develop symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, after they were given caffeine, U.S. researchers said. Researchers at the University of South Florida said back-to-back studies show caffeine significantly decreased abnormal levels of the protein linked to Alzheimer's disease -- both in the brains and in the blood of mice exhibiting symptoms of the disease. Both studies build upon previous research by the University of South Florida that showed caffeine in early adulthood prevented the onset of memory problems in mice bred to develop Alzheimer's symptoms in old age. "The new findings provide evidence that caffeine could be a viable 'treatment' for established Alzheimer's disease, and not simply a protective strategy," lead author Gary Arendash said in a statement. "That's important because caffeine is a safe drug for most people, it easily enters the brain, and it appears to directly affect the disease process." In the study, half of the 55 mice genetically altered to develop memory problems mimicking Alzheimer's disease were given caffeine, and half were given water. Dr Gary Arendash, an American neuroscientist, claims to have uncovered evidence that caffeine not only helps to stave off the disease but can treat it. Mice with a rodent equivalent of the disease showed a 50 per cent reduction in levels of amyloid protein in their brains after the scientists added caffeine to their drinking water. At the end of the two-month study, the caffeine-drinking mice performed far better on tests of memory and thinking than mice given only water.

Now the eye of the mischief must be blinded completely and gouged out, and this can be done by illuminating the events behind the scenes.” However, the Revolutionary Guards’ commander, Maj. Gen.

UN disappointment The deal, however, was described by Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, as "not sufficient". Ban said in a statement that the deal should be backed by medium-term measures to prevent the catastrophic impact of climate change. "The commitments expressed today at the G8 and Major Economies Forum (MEF) leaders' meeting, while welcome, are not sufficient," Ban said in a statement.

The all-male group have been sleeping on the floor, washing in a sink basin and running low on food. One of the workers, who did not want to be named, said: "There are a few stinky bodies and it is hard being away from your family and kids but we've managed to stay in touch on our mobiles which has been great. "One guy has even called us up after seeing the publicity and asked for our mobile numbers and topped our phones up with £10, it's great to see such support." They are protesting at Danish company Vestas Windsystems plan to make 625 workers redundant at the end of this month, despite rising profits. The men have been telling each other jokes in a bid to keep spirits up. 'Face sack' "One of the guys found a pair of latex cycling shorts in the office, so we all had a good laugh when he put them on and ran around. He jokingly added: "It's all guys here so good to be away from the women for a while." The workers say morale is still high inside the factory The protester said the experience is probably similar to being on the television show Big Brother.

Vestas protesters sacked with immediate effect
When the Big Green Gathering, a festival for environmentally minded individuals to share ideas about tackling climate change while practising a little reiki, was cancelled at the weekend, those with tickets were left with nowhere to go. Now a new festival seems to have sprung up to fill the breach. The internet is alive with messages about "Vestival", with activists urging people due to attend the four-day gathering to head instead to the Isle of Wight to support workers protesting against facing the closure of the Vestas wind turbine factory. The BGG was cancelled on Sunday after Mendip district council and Somerset police sought a high court injunction to stop it going ahead. Marina Pepper, an eco-campaigner and Liberal Democrat councillor, tweeted her encouragement to would-be demonstrators today, saying: "Vestival is go. If you can get to Newport by 9.30am Wednesday, all the better (Vestas workers up in court to be evicted). The tone of some tweets verged on celebratory, with climatecamp tweeting: "Then get ye down to Vestival this weekend. The #BGG is going back to its roots. The Life, London and Leninism blog described the gathering as the Vestival of Resistance, writing: "By all accounts the struggle has now taken over 'The Island' – thanks in large part to the RMT union's commitment to throw its weight behind the occupation." A Facebook group, Save Vestas Isle of Wight From Closure, has gathered more than 450 members. It directs people towards the Save Vestas blog, which records the news that a judge in Newport refused to grant Vestas a possession order for the occupied factory, and adjourned the case to 4 August. Danish owners of wind turbine company unable to force workers out of Isle of Wight factory Workers occupying a wind turbine factory on the Isle of Wight vowed to continue their protest for another week today after a legal attempt to evict them quickly failed.

Colombia's relations with Venezuela deteriorate over Swedish rockets
STOCKHOLM, July 28 The Swedish government said on Tuesday it had asked Venezuela for information on how Swedish-made weapons exported to the South American country had found their way to rebels in neighbouring Colombia. Colombia authorities said on Monday they had seized anti-tank weapons purchased in Europe by Venezuela in the hands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. [ID:nN27540288]  "It is correct that they have found these weapons to be Swedish-made," said Jens Eriksson, a top political adviser at the Foreign Ministry to Trade Minister Ewa Bjorling. "We are working together with Colombian authorities to investigate the matter further and we have contacted Venezuelan authorities to clear up how these arms ended up in Colombia." Venezuelan Interior Minister Tareck El Aissami denied on Monday the weapons found in the hands of FARC, which has been fighting for a socialist revolution since the 1960s and is labelled a terrorist organisation by the United States, had come from Venezuela. Eriksson said "a smaller quantity" of arms, mainly ammunition, had also been found in rebel hands. A Swedish Foreign Ministry official said the anti-tank weapons had been exported to Venezuela in the 1980s but that some shipments of ammunition for the weapons systems had occurred at a later date. No licenses have been issued for arms exports to Colombia while no shipments of weapons to Venezuela under a 2006 licence has been carried out in recent years, Eriksson said. In an interview with Caracol Radio Monday, Santos addressed local reports of anti-tank weapons manufactured in Sweden being seized from members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and traced to Venezuela. "In several operations in which we have recovered weapons from the FARC, we have found powerful munitions and powerful equipment, including anti-tank weapons, from a European country that sold them to Venezuela and that turned up in the hands of the FARC."

Haitian migrants drown and many more still missing
MIAMI At least 15 Haitian migrants drowned and more than 65 were missing after their wooden sail boat hit a reef and sank off the Turks and Caicos islands, local police and the U.S. Coast Guard said on Tuesday. More than 120 people were rescued following the shipwreck late on Sunday, and Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were assisting Turks and Caicos authorities in the search for more survivors. Police in the British territory said 15 bodies had been recovered in waters off West Caicos, a sparsely inhabited island popular with divers and boaters. "Our search is continuing, by sea and air," Petty Officer Nick Ameen said in Miami. "As time progresses, the possibility for survival diminishes," he added. Turks and Caicos police spokesman Sergeant Calvin Chase said there were conflicting reports about how many people had been on board the wooden sloop, which he said was carrying illegal migrants from Haiti trying to reach the United States. Estimates given earlier by the Coast Guard ranged from 160 to 200. "The boat ran aground on a reef, Molasses Reef, off West Caicos," Chase told Reuters by phone. Earlier, he said 122 migrants -- 22 women and the rest men -- had been rescued. "They are illegal immigrants," Chase said, adding the repatriation of the survivors back to Haiti had already begun.

Michael Schumacher returns to Formula One to replace injured Massa
Formula One was rocked by two developments Wednesday when seven-time champion Michael Schumacher said he would come out of retirement to drive again for Ferrari, and BMW announced it would leave the international racing series at season's end. Ferrari and Schumacher, 40, confirmed speculation that he would temporarily replace driver Felipe Massa, who was seriously injured during qualifying for last weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix. Schumacher retired after the 2006 season, having won five of his titles with Ferrari, which he continued to serve as a consultant and occasional test driver. "For loyalty reasons to the team, I cannot ignore that unfortunate situation" with Massa, he said. "I also very much look forward to facing this challenge," the German driver said. Formula One's next event, the European Grand Prix in Valencia, Spain, is Aug. 23. The race was added to the schedule only last year -- a race won by Massa -- and Schumacher has yet to race on that track. Provided the 40-year-old seven-time world champion can prove his fitness - and the German is a man who prides himself on his conditioning - he will line up against reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton for the very first time at the European Grand Prix in Valencia on Aug 23. The announcement, which will have Ferrari's hardcore tifosi drooling, came just 24 hours after the German driver's manager, Willi Weber, said he was "200 per cent sure" his client would not race in Valencia. "Michael Schumacher has shown his willingness and in the next few days he will undergo a specific programme of preparation at the end of which it will be possible to confirm his participation in the championship starting with the European Grand Prix." Schumacher, who most certainly does not need the money, said as recently as three weeks ago that he had no intention of making a comeback in a sport he bestrode like a colossus for 15 seasons. And as Weber pointed out, the most successful F1 driver of all time, a man with 91 grand prix wins to his name, is not one to settle for second best.

England remembers Bobby Robson
Donations have been pouring in to a fund set up by Sir Bobby Robson to fight cancer. Over the weekend, fans at matches paid tribute to the County Durham-born footballing legend, who died on Friday after a long battle with the disease. The tributes included a shrine at Newcastle's St James' Park, which Sir Bobby's family visited on Sunday. A page on the Just Giving website has been flooded with donations and had reached £1.6m on Monday morning. The Sir Bobby Robson Foundation was set up by the former England manager in March 2008 to raise money to fund clinical trials of new drugs and treatments to beat cancer. Books of condolence Professor Ruth Plummer, from the foundation, said: "There have been pages of donations even from early Friday morning looking at the website. "People have been incredibly generous yet again, this time in memory of Sir Bobby." People can also sign a book at the Town Hall, in Durham, while another at Fulham's Craven Cottage ground has been open over the weekend. Newcastle United said tens of thousands of people had visited St James' Park since Friday, leaving flowers, scarves, banners and shirts. The Sir John Hall Stand at the ground will be open from 0900 to 1700 BST each day this week for people to continue to pay their tributes.

Nigerian victory marred by deaths in custody
The BBC has obtained a photograph which shows that Yusuf Mohamed, the leader of the Boko Haram sect in Nigeria, was alive when captured by the army. They handed him over to the police. A few hours later, journalists were shown his bullet-ridden body. The police said he had been fatally wounded while trying to evade capture. Mr Yusuf's Islamic sect is blamed for days of violent clashes with security forces across northern Nigeria, which killed hundreds of people. Nigeria's declaration of victory over Taliban-style militants was overshadowed last night by demands for an inquiry into the "extrajudicial killing" of the sect's leader. The bullet-riddled body of Mohammed Yusuf, head of the Islamist sect Boko Haram, was shown to journalists hours after police announced his capture at the end of a four-day manhunt. Emmanuel Ojukwu, a national police spokesman, said: "This group operates under a charismatic leader. But the triumphalism was punctured by conflicting accounts of how Yusuf died. Colonel Ben Ahanotu, commander of the military operation against Boko Haram, who claims he personally captured Yusuf, said that he had been unarmed and gave himself up willingly.

Food packages to Vestas occupiers cut off
Mass walkouts could be commonplace in a new "age of militancy" as pay deals are curbed, according to Policy Exchange. The stark message came as fears grew of a summer of discontent with a series of strikes already planned or likely, including a possible national postal strike. Holidaymakers and railway passengers could all be hit while the row over foreign workers is set to deepen with plans to ballot workers at power stations and oil refineries following the recent unofficial action. One union warned British workers have become increasingly militant and angry with pay the cost of a recession "they did not create". Neil O'Brien, director of Policy Exchange, said: "There is a slight increase in militancy at the moment but that is nothing compared to what is going to happen once the brakes are slammed on public spending. "When we suddenly go from a very very rapid increase in pay to huge pressure on public spending, it is possible that we could have something develop like the 1970s." During the 1970s the number of strikes averaged between 2,000 and 3,000 every year, peaking in 1979 when almost 30 million working days were lost due to industrial action. "I think what is happening is people are being expected to pay a heavy price for a recession that they did not create," he said. "Increasingly people are realising there are expected to carry the can for what is none of their doing. A summer of discontent is an overused phrase but the RMT is not surprised people are angry enough and saying 'we have had enough of this and better do something about this'." As the recession deepens there is growing unrest among workers and the country is already bracing itself for a number of walkouts over the coming weeks.

Police evict Vestas protesters
by Michael Stoddard BBC South The workers ended the protest in dramatic fashion There were cheers, tears and defiance as the final six Vestas workers ended their 19-day sit-in protest. Bailiffs had to force their way inside the first-floor office, which has been the protesters' home since 20 July. One worker leapt from a balcony, landing in a bush. Two others abseiled from the factory while hundreds of supporters aimed chants of "shame" at the factory owners. "It is all a bit bewildering but it's a wonderful feeling to get out and a major relief," one of the workers told BBC News. "We all feel like we have scored a moral victory and believe it has been more than worthwhile. "I can't wait to have a cold beer, long wash and a chicken vindaloo curry." VESTAS SIT-IN ENDS By the BBC's Steve Humphrey on the Isle of Wight After 19 days of a tense stand off, it all ended in less than an hour in a frantic and dramatic fashion. They all looked remarkably well but in need of a good meal and shower, but still vowing to fight on. The group had barricaded themselves inside the wind turbine blade factory in Newport on the Isle of Wight in protest at Vestas' plans to close the site and other operations with the loss of 625 jobs. They defied requests to leave from management, a court order and only left when bailiffs arrived to evict them.

600 people missing after typhoon hits Taiwan
TAIPEI, Taiwan -- TV stations say Taiwan's military has rescued about 130 people whose village has been consumed by a typhoon-spawned mudslide, but there is no word on the fate of hundreds of others buried by the disaster in the island's south. The mudslide touched off by Typhoon Morakot inundated the remote mountain village of Shiao Lin on Sunday, leaving at least 400 people unaccounted for. The storm dumped as much as 80 inches (2 meters) of rain on the island before moving on to China. On Tuesday, authorities said at least 41 people were confirmed dead and 60 were missing after Morakot swept Taiwan. Those tolls do not include the residents of Shiao Lin, whose fate has been unclear since Sunday's mudslide. BEIJING, Aug. 10 (UPI) -- Mudslides struck China and Taiwan, raising the toll of dead and missing, as the two countries battled rains and floods from Typhoon Morakot, officials said. In Taiwan, where floods and rains have already killed at least 23 people and left 56 missing since the typhoon struck Friday, a massive land and mudslide Monday smashed into the village of Xiaolin in Taiwan's Kaohsiung County. In China, a massive landslide Monday night brought down up to seven apartment buildings in eastern Pengxi Township in Taishun County in Zhejiang Province, burying an unknown number of residents, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, quoting local authorities. The report said rescuers had pulled six people alive from the debris by Tuesday with one of them reported in critical condition. The landslide was triggered by continuous torrential rain from Typhoon Morakot, which has already killed six people and left three others missing since making landfall in China's eastern coastal region Sunday.

Cargo ship Arctic Sea may be found
Advertisement Mystery still surrounds a missing Russian-manned cargo ship, with a sighting off Africa's Cape Verde islands still to be confirmed. The Arctic Sea, with 15 Russian crew members on board, was last sighted in the Bay of Biscay on 30 July. Cape Verde officials say they think the ship is 400 nautical miles (740km) off one of the islands. But Moscow's envoy to Cape Verde said he had not been informed of any confirmed sighting.

AFP news agency quoted Finnish police as saying a ransom demand had been made of the ship's Finnish owners, Solchart Management. A source linked to the Cape Verde coastguard told AFP the Arctic Sea was outside its territorial waters. The coastguard was informing maritime officials about the ship's movements, the source said, adding: "When the ship enters our jurisdiction, we will decide in consultation with our partners what actions to take." French intelligence said it had found a ship matching the Arctic Sea's description in the area. The Portuguese military would not confirm one of its planes had flown over the vessel. Radar contact with the Arctic Sea was lost after it left the English Channel However, the Russian ambassador to Cape Verde, Alexander Karpushin, said he had not been officially informed of the sighting and told Russia's RAI agency the sighting was "not true".

Vestas plant in Newport, England shuts down
Vestas, the wind-turbine maker, closed two factories on the South Coast yesterday with the loss of 425 jobs. The Danish company ceased blade production at its sites in Southampton and on the Isle of Wight. Workers had occupied the Isle of Wight plant for 18 days in protest at the closures until last week. Vestas Wind Systems had obtained a court order after six workers barricaded themselves into the plant for more than two weeks in a bid to delay its closure. Members of the Climate Rush campaign group, left, also chained themselves to Business Secretary Lord Mandelson's home in London, in an "act of solidarity". Originally it was believed there would be 625 job cuts but Vestas said yesterday that it had made 425 staff redundant. The firm said it had mitigated job losses, with 40 employees found new roles and 57 continuing work at the factory for a further period to assist in its closure. Turbine maker says closures will balance demand, as boss criticises UK's commitment to wind and hints at redundancy reinstatement for protesters Vestas has confirmed the closure of two sites on the Isle of Wight and Southampton with the loss of 425 jobs. The protest was hugely embarrassing for the government at a time when it is promoting wind energy and green jobs. The Vestas plant was the only one in the country making components for wind turbines. The company said that 40 employees had been found new roles within the Vestas research and development facility on the Isle of Wight.

Lockerbie bombing appeal dropped
(CNN) -- A Scottish court has formally allowed Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi to abandon his second appeal against his conviction over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, in which 270 people were killed when an airliner was blown out of the sky. Convicted bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, pictured in 1992, has terminal cancer. Last week, al Megrahi lodged a "minute of abandonment" with the Scottish Court Service, which is a legal move to drop an appeal. The Scottish Court of Appeal in Edinburgh confirmed Tuesday it had accepted the request. Analysts say the move may be part of a deal al Megrahi is seeking with Scottish authorities to be released on compassionate grounds. A compassionate release could allow al Megrahi, who has maintained his innocence, to return to his native Libya. Megrahi, 57, who is suffering from terminal prostate cancer, is currently serving a life sentence for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 which killed 189 U.S. citizens and 270 people in total. The court announcement follows increasing pressure from the U.S. for Al Megrahi to remain imprisoned in Scotland. The letter, which includes the signatures of John Kerry, the current chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and veteran Edward Kennedy, has expressed concern about reports that Al Megrahi is about to be released. The letter continues: "Our international agreement called for his sentence to be served in Scotland and we believe strongly there should be no deviation from this sentence."

Usain Bolt breaks 200m and 100m sprint records at championships
He runs, he wins, he obliterates another world record. Welcome to the life of Usain Bolt, aka Lightning Bolt, the fastest man who ever lived, and not your conventional athletics hero. Certainly his exploits on a running track epitomise the Olympic motto: Citius, Altius, Fortius. At last year's Olympic Games in Beijing, the Jamaican, who turned 23 yesterday, became a global star by winning the 100m (at a canter), the 200m (with apparent ease), and a third gold medal in the 4 x 100m relay, all in world record times. Nobody had performed that treble feat before and, in doing it, Bolt not only became Jamaica's most famous global export since Bob Marley, but also the flag-bearer for a revival of athletics as a credible, crowd-pulling sport. This week he has raised his game again, from the merely staggering to the frankly awesome, to confirm himself as the supreme sprinter of this or any other age. At the world championships in Berlin, he won the world 100m gold medal last Sunday in 9.58 seconds, knocking 0.11sec – a whopping margin – from the 9.69sec record he set in China. Then on Thursday evening he followed that by winning the 200m gold in 19.19sec, again knocking 0.11sec from the 19.30sec record he set in China. "I can definitely say I didn't expect that," he said immediately afterwards. Experts are at a loss to predict how fast Bolt might run when he peaks – and he could continue getting faster for years. Some say 9.4 seconds or lower for 100m is inevitable, while 19 seconds for the 200m may not be beyond him.

Al-Megrahi 'relieved' Al-Megrahi returned to Libya after boarding a plane at Prestwick airport in Glasgow, Scotland. He was earlier released from Greenock prison and escorted by a police convoy to the airport. In a statement following his release, al-Megrahi said: "I am obviously very relieved to be leaving my prison cell at last and returning to Libya, my homeland. "The remaining days of my life are being lived under the shadow of the wrongness of my conviction. "I have been faced with an appalling choice: to risk dying in prison in the hope that my name is cleared posthumously or to return home still carrying the weight of the guilty verdict, which will never now be lifted. "The choice which I made is a matter of sorrow, disappointment and anger, which I fear I will never overcome." "Al-Megrahi's mother said she has her home door open, because she won't believe that he is free unless she sees him for herself," he said local press had reported. MacAskill ruled out allowing al-Megrahi to live in Scotland due to security concerns.

Presidential election held in Afghanistan
Advertisement Afghan President Hamid Karzai and his Western allies have pronounced the country's election a success, after voting passed off largely peacefully. Mr Karzai hailed Afghans for braving Taliban "bombs and intimidations". There were some attacks by insurgents, but the UN says the vast majority of polling stations were able to function. President Karzai is facing challenges from about 30 rivals. Official results are not expected for two weeks. "The Afghan people dared rockets, bombs and intimidations," he told reporters as polls closed following a one-hour extension. Mr Karzai praised the citizens who turned out to vote "We'll see what the turnout was. In Washington, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said: "Lots of people have defied threats of violence and terror to express their thoughts about the next government for the people of Afghanistan." Mr Karzai said that based on reports by the interior ministry, 73 attacks had taken place in 15 provinces. Among the violent incidents reported: Taliban militants stormed a town in Baghlan, northern Afghanistan, preventing polling stations from opening, police tell AFP news agency.

Formula 1: Barrichello and Alonso top timesheets at European GP Friday Practice
EUROPEAN GRAND PRIX Venue: Valencia Dates: 21-23 August 2009 Coverage: Live coverage of Friday's practice sessions, Saturday qualifying and Sunday's race - which starts at 1300 BST - across BBC TV, radio and online platforms. Find full listings here By Chris Whyatt Renault's Fernando Alonso set the fastest lap in Friday practice for the European Grand Prix while stuttering championship leaders Brawn went well. Despite a collision with Nick Heidfeld, the Spaniard clocked one minute 39:404 seconds in the quicker second session. Brawn's Jenson Button was second in hot conditions while team-mate Rubens Barrichello topped the first session. McLaren impressed in the morning, though world champion Lewis Hamilton span out early on in the afternoon. "I had a bit of a half spin in the high speed corner and damaged the wing," said the 24-year-old. "I didn't even really feel it but I did touch the wall and grazed the front but it could have been a lot worse. I think we'll still be good tomorrow [for qualifying] so I'm still positive. It's just a shame we missed so much time but it can be regained Lewis Hamilton "We made some changes this weekend and tried something new on my car and we don't have lots of wings available but if we go back to the old set-up then we have spares so it won't be a problem. "I think we'll still be good tomorrow so I'm still positive. It's just a shame we missed so much time but it can be regained." Practice timesheets are essentially irrelevant - teams are largely testing cars and running different programmes for each of their two drivers in order to collect data they can analyse afterwards. But McLaren, for whom world champion Hamilton won the last grand prix in Hungary, may be heartened that their recent progress appears to be continuing with their strong showing in the first session, as Heikki Kovalainen and Hamilton came second and third respectively. Friday practice at the Valencia street circuit marked the first grand prix action after a month-long summer break and many teams have brought modified cars into the 11th instalment of the 17-race season. Early on, the track was both dirty and slippery - but the street circuit gained grip in the afternoon with Alonso's time not far off Massa's 2008 qualifying pole lap of 1:38.989.

UK denies pressuring Scotland into Lockerbie release
LONDON, England (CNN) -- Libya warned the United Kingdom that if the Lockerbie bomber died in prison in Scotland, it would have "catastrophic effects for the relationship between Libya and the U.K.," documents declassified Tuesday show. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, second from left, arrives in Tripoli, Libya, on August 21. The statement was made by Abdulati Alobidi, the Libyan minister for Europe, to a British Foreign Office minister in February and was repeated to Scottish officials the following month, newly declassified Scottish government notes from the meetings say. Alobidi had earlier told Scottish officials it would be "a major problem should Mr. al Megrahi die in prison, and would be viewed as a form of death sentence." Watch more about the documents » They are trying to squelch newspaper claims that the British government wanted al Megrahi to be eligible for release as a part of a deal allowing BP to drill for oil in Libya. But they seem unlikely to put an end to the controversy over the release of the man convicted of killing 270 people in the bombing nearly 21 years ago. U.S. President Barack Obama reacted strongly to al Megrahi's welcome, calling it "highly objectionable." U.S. officials, including FBI Director Robert Mueller, criticized the decision to release him. But Scotland's leaders had long feared that the warming of relations between Libya and Britain would force Scotland to hand over al Megrahi, the documents indicate. "No deal has been done to secure the transfer of Mr. al Megrahi to Libya," Straw's predecessor, Lord Charles Falconer, wrote back to him on June 22, 2007. "We have made clear (to Libya) on diplomatic channels that, for any reason, any Prisoner Transfer Agreement with Libya could not cover Mr. al Megrahi," Falconer said, adding that under the terms of relations between London and Edinburgh, any steps regarding al Megrahi's future "will ultimately be for Scottish ministers to take."

Two jockeys killed in fire in North Yorkshire, England
The two jockeys died as the fire spread through the flats in Buckrose Court in Norton, near Malton, in the early hours of Saturday. Neighbours said they believed Miss Wilson was the girlfriend of another jockey, Ian Brennan, who jumped out of a window at the three-storey block to escape. Alan Foster, a businessman in his 30s who owns the building, said he let the flat to Mr Kyne and Mr Brennan, who had recently moved to Malton from Dublin. Mr Foster said he thought the fire had started in a hallway. Currently third in the apprentice jockey championship, he rode for the Irish trainer John Quinn, who runs a racing yard in Malton. Miss Wilson, from Forfar, Scotland, was riding in her first season of professional racing for the trainer David Barron and had been due to ride her mother’s horse, Imperial Sword, at Thirsk on Saturday. Mr Barron, who is based in Thirsk, North Yorks, paid tribute to Miss Wilson as a “tremendous” jockey. “She was just at the start of her career and was only in her first year of riding as an apprentice,” he said. “She joined me at the end of last year and had ridden three winners for me out of only a handful of rides. Everyone in the yard is just devastated.” Her parents, Margaret and Drew Wilson, were too upset to speak as they travelled from Forfar to North Yorkshire. Mr Kyne was also due to have ridden on Saturday at Haydock, where jockeys wore black armbands and a 20-second silence was observed before the first race. Thirsk and Kempton racecourses also staged moments of silence, and flags at York racecourse flew at half mast, while jockeys at Stratford donned black armbands.

Large bomb defused in Northern Ireland
British army bomb disposal experts have defused a large explosive device found planted close to the border in south Armagh today. The 600lb device was found on a roadside near the village of Forkhill and had a command wire leading to a firing point on the other side of the border. Dissident republicans are believed to be responsible for planting the bomb. Irish soldiers and Gardai mounted a security operation on the southern side of the border while the device was being made safe today. The remnants have now been taken away for forensic examination. A major security operation was launched following the bomb find Police have said a large bomb left close to the Irish border in south Armagh was intended to kill officers. The 600lb bomb was made safe by an Army bomb disposal team near Forkhill. The device had a command wire running from where it was planted in Northern Ireland to a firing point across the border in the Republic. Police said it could have had a "devastating outcome".

Deadly flash flooding hits northwestern Turkey
Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement At least 23 people have been killed and a number of others are missing after flash floods in north-west Turkey. The flooding struck districts in and around Turkey's largest city of Istanbul, swamping houses and roads. Cars were swept away and some drivers were trapped inside their vehicles. TV pictures showed roads near Istanbul's main airport submerged by deep water. The flooding was caused by two days of torrential rainfall - the worst in 80 years. 'Disaster' As waters rose, police and military helicopters rescued people from rooftops in Istanbul and its suburbs. My friend got stuck in the truck after the water rose all at once. The vehicle stopped working after filling with water. We rescued him with a winch Kamil Coskun, Istanbul resident In pictures: Istanbul floods The worst flooding was in low-lying areas in the western (European) part of the city straddling the Bosphorus Strait, which divides Europe from Asia.

New York Times reporter rescued in Afghanistan
British special forces in Afghanistan rescued a New York Times reporter who was kidnapped Saturday by the Taliban, but the deaths of his interpreter and a British commando in the predawn raid Wednesday raised questions about the operation. Gunmen had seized journalist Stephen Farrell, who is a dual British-Irish citizen, and Afghan interpreter Sultan Munadi in a village in Kunduz province that was the scene of bombings last week by North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces that killed dozens of people. British commandos freed a New York Times reporter early Wednesday from Taliban captives who kidnapped him over the weekend in northern Afghanistan, but one of the commandos and a Times' translator were killed in the rescue, officials said.Reporter Stephen Farrell was taken hostage along with his translator in the northern province of Kunduz on Saturday. German commanders had ordered U.S. jets to drop bombs on two hijacked fuel tankers, causing a number of civilian casualties, and reporters traveled to the area to cover the story.One British service member died during the raid, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said, while the Times reported that Farrell's Afghan translator, Sultan Munadi, 34, also was killed. Brown said "we send his family our condolences." Farrell was unhurt.Gunfire rang out from multiple sides during the rescue, and a Taliban commander who was in the house was killed, along with the owner of the house and a woman, said Mohammad Sami Yowar, a spokesman for the Kunduz governor.Munadi was killed in the midst of the firefight, he said. A British defense official said he couldn't rule out the possibility he was killed by British gunfire.Afghan officials over the weekend said about 70 people died when U.S. jets dropped two bombs on the tankers, igniting them in a massive explosion. There were reports that villagers who had come to collect fuel from the tankers were among the dead, and Farrell wanted to interview villagers.The Times reported that while Farrell and Munadi were talking to Afghans near the site of the bombing, an old man approached them and warned them to leave. Soon after, gunshots rang out and people shouted that the Taliban were approaching.Police had warned reporters who traveled to the capital of Kunduz to cover the tanker strike that the village in question was controlled by the Taliban, and it would be dangerous to go there.The Times kept the kidnappings quiet out of concern for the men's safety, and other media outlets, including The Associated Press, did not report the abductions following a request from the Times.quoted Farrell saying he had been "extracted" by a commando raid carried out by "a lot of soldiers" in a firefight.Mohammad Sami Yowar, a spokesman for the Kunduz governor, said British Special Forces dropped down from helicopters early Wednesday onto the house where the two were being kept, and a gun battle ensued.A Taliban commander who was in the house was killed, along with the owner of the house and a woman who was inside, Yowar said. He said the battle took place at a civilian house being used by the Taliban, but that all militants fled the scene safely.The militant, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, claimed one Afghan civilian was killed and another injured in the firefight. "The militant commander's claims could not be independently verified, but Taliban claims are often exaggerated.Farrell, a dual Irish-British citizen, told the Times that he saw Munadi step forward shouting "Journalist!

Yale graduate student who went missing before wedding found dead
(Facebook Photo) The 24-year-old bride-to-be, who had been missing since Tuesday, apparently met a violent death in a secure Yale University building accessible only to students and staff, police said Sunday on what was supposed to be her wedding day.Authorities have said little about the investigation.They hadn't positively identified the body found hidden in a wall Sunday, but they were assuming it was Annie Le's and treating her disappearance as a homicide.State police found the body in a building in Yale's medical complex, about a mile from the main campus. It was in an area that houses utility cables that run between floors.The university planned a candlelight vigil at 8 p.m. Monday at the Ivy League university. The Yale Daily News says an e-mail to the Yale community invites participants to "bring a candle and join us in solidarity. "Just seven months before Le went missing, the graduate student wrote a magazine article about how to stay safe on the streets around the Ivy League school. Annie Le was so focused on academics that, even though she was the valedictorian of her high school class and her classmates voted her “most likely to be the next Einstein,” she filled out 102 applications for scholarships. “My tongue is sore from licking envelopes, my wrist hurts from typing and stapling, and the post office clerk knows me on a first name basis,” she wrote in a one-page primer she left in the files of the school in El Dorado, Calif., “but other than that, there is nothing I can complain about; It was not difficult at all!” Her work paid off, literally: She received $160,000 in scholarship offers, said Tony DeVille, who became principal three years ago, three years after she graduated. She went on to Yale, where, as a 24-year-old graduate student, she was studying pharmacology and planning her wedding to another serious-minded student from her days in Rochester.

British chef Keith Floyd dies at age 65
When it first appeared on a regional strand of the BBC in 1985, Keith Floyd's 10-minute cooking slot attracted 10,000 viewers' calls asking for recipes and greater exposure for the genial chef, mainly from female viewers. Over the next 15 years Floyd produced 19 series for the BBC and Channel 5 from every corner of the globe, and wrote more than 20 cookbooks to accompany his programmes. Long after he had effectively retired from British television screens the BBC continued to syndicate his shows to foreign audiences with whom they proved enduringly popular. Combining raffish charm and contagious enthusiasm on screen, Floyd's programmes dispensed with the static formality that had defined the television cookery of his forerunners, such as Fanny Cradock. Indeed they rarely took place in anything that could be defined as a studio. Instead he was likely to be found braced over a camping stove on the heaving deck of a North Sea trawler, rhapsodising over a sea bass. So too was his penchant for ad libbing jocular instructions to his film crew. A generation of viewers became familiar with Clive and various other long-suffering cameramen, who were forever being ordered to get in close for a look at a fish gill or the marbling on a steak. This he owed to his long-standing BBC producer David Pritchard, who advised him to fill in the boring bits with "a quick slurp". With craggy good looks, slightly askew bow tie and upper-class tones gravelled by a prodigious smoking habit, Floyd had something of the roguish charm of a 1950s chancer about him.

U.S. Senate releases version of Healthcare Bill
worked for months to find common ground with Republicans on health care reform — but when he released his long-anticipated proposal Wednesday, the real problem quickly came into focus. He set the stage for a titanic struggle within his own party. Story Continued Below Reaction from congressional Democratic leaders was lukewarm to worse, progressives were downright hostile and Republicans were scornful of what they described as brazen government grab. But Baucus may have provided lawmakers with the only viable blueprint for winning support across Congress, because he sought to find elements that pleased all sides. “There are honest and principled differences on all of us working for reform, and this package may not represent all of our first choices,” Baucus said. “But at the end of the day, we all share a common purpose: that is to make the lives of Americans better tomorrow than they are today and to get health care reform done, which means the time for action is now.” The next challenge for Baucus and the Senate leadership is to get the bill out of the Finance Committee — but after that, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will need to merge the Finance bill with one approved in July by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Even Reid, who has generally supported Baucus’s efforts, sounded less than pleased, saying he needs to be convinced the bill is right for Nevada on a proposed Medicaid expansion. Baucus has made the challenge clear for Democrats, who now must choose between competing visions of health reform: an employer mandate versus fees on employers, a public insurance option versus nonprofit insurance cooperatives, and taxes on millionaires versus industry and people with expensive health care plans. The proposal capped months of closed-door discussions that, in the end, produced no immediate Republican support — and critical comments from negotiators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Mike Enzi of Wyoming, both of whom complained about “artificial deadlines” from the White House and Democratic leaders to push through a bill, as Grassley said. It would leave 25 million people uninsured in 2019 — a third of whom are illegal immigrants — compared with 17 million in the House bill.

Pope Benedict XVI announces visit to United Kingdom
The last papal visit was in May 1982 Pope Benedict XVI is to visit Britain in 2010, the BBC has learned. It will be the first papal visit to Britain since 1982, when Pope John Paul II's six-day tour drew huge crowds. The news of Pope Benedict's visit comes after Gordon Brown extended a formal invitation to the Pope during a private audience in February. A spokesman for the prime minister said he was "delighted" and "it would be a moving and momentous occasion for the whole country". Details of his visit have yet to emerge but the trip is set to be the first official state visit by a pontiff - John Paul II's visit in May 1982 was on a pastoral basis and did not follow an official invitation by the UK government. 'Warmly received' A spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: "The PM is obviously delighted at the prospect of a visit from Pope Benedict XVI to Britain. "It would be a moving and momentous occasion for the whole country and he would undoubtedly receive the warmest of welcomes." Conservative leader David Cameron said he was "delighted" to hear of the possible visit. He said: "Such a visit - the first in over a quarter of a century - would be greatly welcomed not only by Roman Catholics but by the country as a whole." I'm sure I speak on behalf of Anglicans throughout Britain, in assuring him that he would be received with great warmth and joy Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams The Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales also sent the Pope a formal invitation in 2007.

Chess grandmasters Kasparov and Karpov play match in Spain
Tuesday, Garry Kasparov beat Anatoly Karpov in the first two games of a 12-game exhibition match in Valencia, Spain. The match is being held to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the first world championship match between the two players. That match was famously suspended after five months and 48 games. Kasparov went on win the title in 1985 and then defended it against Karpov in matches in 1986, 1987 and 1990. Kasparov and Karpov became enemies during those matches, but many years have passed and they have mellowed. For several years now, they have been willing to capitalize on their rivalry by playing exhibitions and short matches. In 2002, they played a four-game rapid match (time control of 25 minutes per player per game, with time added to each player’s clock after each move) in Times Square in New York City. Kasparov retired in 2005 and Karpov still competes, but Kasparov is 12 years younger and that is a considerable advantage. Karpov, however, has slipped noticeably in recent years.

Testimony by John Travolta that son was autistic raises Scientology questions
share tweet email During court proceedings in the Bahamas on Sept. 22, John Travolta said that his 16-year-old son Jett, who died after a having a seizure in January, suffered from autism. “My son was autistic and he suffered from seizure disorder every five to 10 days,” Travolta told the court. This appeared to be the first time the actor has publicly recognized Jett’s autism — previously he’d said only that his son suffered from Kawasaki disease, a blood disorder. The fact that Travolta and wife Kelly Preston have not previously recognized their son’s autism has drawn criticism from many. Some have claimed that the Travoltas' longtime devotion to the Church of Scientology — which separates psychiatric conditions from medical conditions — has prevented them from being open about Jett’s autism. “As with any medical condition, the Church believes that these matters are best diagnosed and treated by a medical doctor. Travolta’s testimony was part of an extortion trial that alleges that paramedic Tarrino Lightbourne and his attorney, Pleasant Bridgewater, a Bahamian senator, conspired to extort $25 million from Travolta in return for not publicizing a document that would indicate Travolta didn’t want Jett transported to a hospital. In the end, Jett was transported to the hospital, so the document seems moot — which is why some wonder why Travolta and Preston are going through the process of litigating.

Iran announces its building of a second nuclear power plant
Iran has been subjected to four rounds of United Nations Security Council sanctions in relation to its nuclear programme. In spite of this, it has continued its uranium enrichment operations and there is growing pressure for sanctions to be tightened further. The following are the UN resolutions relating to Iran's nuclear programme. DEMAND TO END ENRICHMENT - RESOLUTION 1696 In March 2006, the issue was discussed at the UN Security Council, which called for a report by the IAEA to establish Iran's compliance with the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The treaty allows for the use of nuclear technology for peaceful energy purposes, as long as countries can demonstrate that their programmes are not being used for the development of nuclear weapons. In July 2006, the Security Council said it was "seriously concerned" that the IAEA was unable to provide assurances about Iran's undeclared nuclear material. It demanded that Iran "suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development", giving it one month to do so. Failing that, it would face the possibility of economic and diplomatic sanctions. Iran asserted that its nuclear programme was for civilian use permitted by the NPT. On this basis it said it rejected the validity of the Security Council's calls. It claimed that while subscribers to the NPT were being punished, those who had not signed up to the agreement were being rewarded by generous nuclear cooperation agreements. This called on states to block Iran's import and export of "sensitive nuclear material and equipment" and to freeze the financial assets of those involved in Iran's nuclear activities.

Over 700 killed after earthquake in Indonesia
Rescue and relief teams have been ordered to 'flood' Padang with aid [AFP] Rescue and relief teams have been ordered to 'flood' Padang with aid [AFP] Indonesia's health ministry has said it fears thousands of people may have died. Rescue operations Rick Cameron, the director of Island Aid, a disaster relief organisation in Indonesia, said he had been taken by surprise by the second tremor. He told Al Jazeera: "We all jumped up, ran to a grassy area outside the house. As we went down the stairs it intensified. "It was extremely disorienting and shakes every perspective of what you think the world is." It was unclear how many injuries the second earthquake had caused, but Raphael Abreu, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey, told Al Jazeera that it had been "definitely capable of creating, by itself, significant damage to structures and property". Step Vaessen, Al Jazeera's correspondent reporting from Padang, said: "So far, the worst incident I've seen is 160 people buried at one location. High-rise buildings, many of which have collapsed totally or partially - so lots of people trapped ... but it is still hard to say how many have died. "I haven't seen many rescue workers active at all. I don't think there's enough equipment at the moment in Padang to conduct these operations." The UN said the death told had risen to 1,100 - up from 770 given by the disaster ministry.

British nursery worker admits sexually abusing children
The trio met on the social networking website Facebook A Plymouth nursery worker and two other people she met online have admitted a series of child sex abuse charges. Vanessa George, Angela Allen, from Nottingham, and Colin Blanchard, from Rochdale, all 39, had never met in person before they appeared in court. Abuse was recorded on mobile phones and images exchanged via e-mail and text. Police, who described the abuse as "horrific", are continuing to try to identify victims at George's nursery. Children's Secretary Ed Balls said it was a "deeply distressing and disturbing case" and he expected the serious case review to be completed as soon as possible. "It is vital we find out how an adult could abuse their position of trust in such an evil way and do everything we can to prevent this kind of abuse happening in the future," he said. Detective Superintendent Adrian Pearson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said the trio had been guilty of child abuse in its most "horrific and devilish form". "Those three individuals have shared quite willingly and freely images, texts, fantasies of the most serious level you could imagine," he said. "These three individuals each acted in a way which ordinary people will find hard to understand," she said. "They showed total disregard for the lives of their victims, their own families and those they worked with, all of whom have been left devastated by these crimes."

US unemployment rate reaches 9.8%
Employers cut another 263,000 jobs in September and the unemployment rate rose to a 26-year high of 9.8%, raising worries that the persistently weak labor market could undermine a nascent economic recovery from the worst U.S. recession since the Great Depression. The economy, by most accounts, has begun to grow again. But Friday's Labor Department report underscored the risk that without jobs, consumers won't have income to spend and... The endurance of hard times seems likely to increase pressure on the Obama administration and Congress to consider another dose of spending aimed at stimulating the economy, even as the government grapples with deficits projected by some economists to exceed $10 trillion over the next decade. Photo Despite a $787 billion stimulus package adopted early this year and aimed in part at shoring up state and local coffers, government jobs slipped by 53,000 in September. “That’s the budget crunch hitting,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.

Ireland votes 'Yes' to Lisbon Treaty
It was lashing with rain but that wasn't the full reason Paul Callaghan was finding it hard to muster up the enthusiasm to mark his X. "I'm here because I have a vote and, basically, I've been told what to do with it," he said gloomily as he stood outside one of Dublin's polling stations in O'Connell Street on Saturday afternoon. "Look at the state we are in now," he said. "A year ago I had a job, life was rosy. Every time I turn on the television some politician tells me that only the EU can save this country now. It isn't how I voted 16 months ago, but I've been left feeling I have no choice." Bowed and more bloodied than most by the recession, and with its government's finances reeling under 20 million euros of debt, Mr Callaghan, like most of the Irish, did on Friday as he was told by Europe and reversed his earlier rejection of the controversial Treaty by voting yes. With more than half a million unemployed and the country now deep in recession, the majority of Ireland's electorate clearly felt they now had no choice but to switch allegiance and, reluctantly, come out in support of the European Union – presumably in the hope that it can help its failing fortunes. "The whole Celtic Tiger image is dead," said Mr Callaghan, a former store manager, as he stood among a disgruntled group of voters.

BBC receives 487 complaints after 'Dancing' race row
Total complaints up by almost 200 after Strictly Come Dancing host says nation should get a 'sense of humour' about race row Complaints about Strictly Come Dancing star Anton Du Beke's racist remarks have shot up after the show's host, Bruce Forsyth, intervened in the row. The BBC said it had received 686 complaints as of this morning, up almost 200 on yesterday's total of 487. The complaints against the show – sparked by Du Beke calling his dancing partner Laila Rouass a "Paki" in rehearsals – had been tailing off. But after Forsyth told the TalkSport radio station that the nation should get a "sense of humour" about the incident yesterday, viewers rang in again to complain. The BBC said they had also been registering their support for Du Beke, with a total of 63 saying the row had been blown out of proportion, more than double the 30 who had called by yesterday. The controversy began at the weekend when it emerged that Du Beke had told Rouass she "looked like a Paki" after turning up to a rehearsal with a spray tan. Rouass accepted Du Beke's subsequent apology, and the BBC hoped the row would die down, despite accusations of double-standards over its treatment of Carol Thatcher in a similar incident earlier in the year. In his unscheduled radio appearance yesterday, Forsyth said: "We used to have a sense of humour about this. At one time the Americans used to call us 'limeys' which doesn't sound very nice, but we used to laugh about it. And Anton is such a sweet guy, it's such a terrible shame." Forsyth added that he was sure there was "nothing vindictive" about Du Beke's remarks and said his apology should be accepted.

Turkey and Armenia sign historic agreement
The two countries signed the protocols under the watchful eyes of big powers Turkey and Armenia have signed a historic accord normalising relations after a century of hostility. The deal was signed by the two foreign ministers after last-minute problems delayed the ceremony in Switzerland. Under the agreement, Turkey and Armenia are to establish diplomatic ties and reopen their shared border. The accord has been met by protests in Armenia, where many people say it does not fully address the 1915 killing of hundreds of thousands of Armenians. Objections Armenia wants Turkey to recognise the killings as an act of genocide, but successive Turkish governments have refused to do so. The agreement calls for a joint commission, also including international experts, to examine the "historical dimension" of the two countries' relations. ANALYSIS Kim Ghattas, BBC News, Zurich Turkey and Armenia both have an interest in turning the page - the economy of landlocked Armenia would benefit from access to Turkey. Ties with Turkey, a key American ally, have come under strain repeatedly because of the million and a half Armenian Americans who have lobbied for a draft resolution in the US Congress to name the World War I killings as genocide. Clinton put to the test Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and his Armenian counterpart, Edward Nalbandian, signed the protocols in Switzerland after a delay of more than three hours. The BBC's Kim Ghattas in Zurich says the Armenians had apparently raised objections to remarks due to be read out by the Turkish delegation. After the signing neither side issued a statement, and our correspondent says this seems to have been the compromise arranged by US officials.

6-year-old boy in Colorado found alive, unhurt after runaway balloon allegedly carried him away
The tale of the experimental helium air balloon sailing above the Colorado plains for two hours on Thursday afternoon captivated the nation, and it had as many twists and turns as the strange flight. So what does a 6-year-old boy hiding in an attic for several hours do to occupy his time as his parents, the police and throngs of investigators are frantically searching for him? Appearing on “Larry King Live” on Thursday night with his parents and brothers, Falcon Heene gave some indication. “First I was playing in the attic,” he said, “then I stopped and went to bed in the attic.” When asked why he went up there in the first place, he responded, “The reason why I went up there, my dad yelled at me, he didn’t want me to play in the flying saucer.” Falcon’s father, Richard Heene, said his son has a habit of slinking away whenever he is scolded. “Whenever we tell him things like ‘It’s a bad thing to do,’ he does go and hide,” he said. “He cowers down, and like if we go to the store and he wants to buy some candy or something, I have to tell him no and he’s always behind and the boys are always saying ‘Come on, Falcon, hurry up.’ ” Police officers and county investigators scoured Falcon Heene’s home twice during the nerve-wracking, air and ground search for him Thursday afternoon. So how did a 6-year-old boy manage to elude so many people for over three hours? On Thursday evening, Sheriff Jim Alderden of Larimer County explained that Falcon had been crawling in and out of a small battery compartment — about one and a half feet by four feet wide — on his father’s balloon contraption throughout the morning. At some point, the boy scurried into the family’s garage out of fear his father would scold him. When the balloon eventually came loose and floated away, Falcon was nowhere to be found, and his family assumed he was in the battery compartment. “The rafters of the garage are partially open and partially enclosed, and the garage is just full of stuff on the floor,” Sheriff Alderden said.

Mark Webber wins 2009 Brazilian Grand Prix, Jenson Button and Brawn win championship
A first lap containing spins, shunts and a pit-lane fireball – more incidents, in fact, than most entire races – set the scene for today's Brazilian grand prix, an absorbing contest in which the celebrations were shared by Mark Webber, winning for the second time this season in his Red Bull-Renault, and Jenson Button, whose fifth place brought him and the Brawn-Mercedes team the double of the 2009 world drivers' and constructors' championships. Given the testing circumstances, Button's drive was the equal of the very best of the six victories he collected in the first half of the see-sawing season. After a catastrophic qualifying session he took his fate into his own hands and drove with controlled aggression. When the slightest mistake would have meant disaster, he executed a series of overtaking manoeuvres with measured authority. At the start of the afternoon the permutations were almost endless. A podium finish would secure the title for Button but a poor tyre choice on Saturday reduced him to 14th place on the grid and gave hope to his team-mate Rubens Barrichello, starting from pole position in front of his home crowd. Sebastian Vettel, the championship outsider, needed both a victory and a bad day for both Brawn drivers, but was another Saturday casualty and started one place behind Button. Adrian Sutil's Force India, starting from third on the grid, was overtaken by Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari as the cars plunged through the dramatic downhill esses and then tangled with Jarno Trulli's Toyota at high speed, putting both cars out. The Italian veteran, believing he had been edged off the track, confronted the young German with a series of gestures suggesting that they might be meeting again to sort it out away from the public gaze. The stewards ruled that it had been a racing incident but fined Trulli $10,000 for refusing to leave the track and for the manner of his confrontion with Sutil. Kovalainen dived into the pits for new tyres and left just ahead of Raikkonen, who had lost his front wing while trying to pass Webber. The McLaren driver, however, restarted with the fuel hose still attached (for which the team were fined $50,000), covering his fellow Finn's Ferrari in a film of petrol which ignited in a spectacular blaze that momentarily blinded Raikkonen but was quickly extinguished by the airflow as he accelerated away.

BBC's Mock The Week 'breached guidelines' with Olympian humour, say corporation's Trust
Mock The Week has been screened since 2005 Satirical gameshow Mock The Week breached guidelines over comments aired about swimmer Rebecca Adlington, the BBC Trust has ruled. Panellist Frankie Boyle's remarks about the Olympic champion were "humiliating" and "risked offending the audience". The show, broadcast in August 2008 in the wake of the Beijing Olympics, prompted 75 complaints from viewers. Its producer apologised in December, saying "the ribbing may have gone a tad too far on this occasion". Final ruling The trust's Editorial Standards Committee also concluded that double gold medallist Adlington had not courted publicity or celebrity status, making the personal remarks unjustified. They added that the makers of Mock The Week, who allowed sexual innuendo and comments about Adlington's appearance to be included, failed to have an editorial reason for including them. The committee's decision is a final ruling on a complaints process that has been in progress since last year. Another complaint against Mock The Week, relating to a comment made about the Queen, was not upheld as a breach of editorial standards by the trust. The BBC recently announced that Boyle was stepping down from the show after seven series to concentrate on other commitments. The Scottish comedian, known for his dour, cutting humour, was called "a brilliant member of the team" by a spokesman for the programme. Meanwhile, BBC Three's Most Annoying People of 2008 show was found by the Editorial Standards Committee to have made "crude and offensive" jokes about the lesbian relationship between actress Lindsay Lohan and DJ Sam Ronson. Remarks made by radio host Spoony and porn actor Ron Jeremy were deemed to be "crude and offensive" and appeared to "reinforce stereotypical views", it ruled.

Ukraine closes schools after reports of swine flu deaths
The Americas have seen the sharpest rise in swine flu deaths The number of swine flu deaths reported worldwide has jumped by more than 700 in a week, latest World Health Organization figures reveal. More than 5,700 swine flu deaths were reported by 25 October, compared to nearly 5,000 the week before. The biggest rise was in the Americas where 4,175 deaths have been reported, up 636 from the week before. Meanwhile, Ukraine has shut all schools and banned public meetings for three weeks after its first swine flu death. Mrs Tymoshenko said there would also be restrictions on what she called non-urgent travel between different parts of Ukraine. Cases 'unreported' The latest WHO figures showed there had been 440,000 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus worldwide. But the organisation said that as many countries have stopped counting individual cases, the actual number is likely to be significantly higher. The BBC's Imogen Foulkes says the WHO has warned for months that as winter sets in, the northern hemisphere can expect swine flu cases to rise. "In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza transmission continues to intensify, marking an unusually early start to winter influenza season in some countries," said the WHO's latest update. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (Sage) said that countries that had made vaccinating children a priority could administer them a single dose to ensure that as many as possible are immunised quickly.

Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah withdraws from elections
"It was the right decision, and I did it in the best interests of this country," Abdullah said. "As far as the process is concerned, hopefully there is a way forward. I will not enter into the constitutional implications of this decision. "But I'll be pursuing the agenda for change and reform in any capacity that I'll be. Perhaps, after a sigh of relief, I will enter into this role with my followers, with my supporters, with the movement that has supported me for the past five months." Shortly after Abdullah's announcement, the campaign team of Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, said the election would still go ahead. "His [Abdullah's] withdrawal should not alter the process... The process should go on and the people of Afghanistan should be given the chance to vote," Wahid Omar, a Karzai spokesman, told Al Jazeera. Illegitimate government  In Sunday's statements, Abdullah said a "transparent election is not possible" and that the Afghan government has been illegitimate since May. The supreme court, appointed by Karzai, extended his mandate after the election was put off from last spring until August. James Bays, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Kabul, said many Afghans had told him that an election with only one candidate would be "farcical".

President Karzai met UN chief Ban Ki-moon earlier in the day Hamid Karzai has been declared president of Afghanistan, after election officials scrapped a planned second round of voting. The announcement comes a day after Mr Karzai's sole challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, pulled out of the race. Dr Abdullah, who had demanded the removal of key poll officials, said the vote would not have been fair. The first round had been marred by fraud. ANALYSIS Andrew North, BBC News, Kabul The announcement that the run-off vote was being cancelled had been widely expected. All reports suggested it was simply a question of finding the legal means to bring the process to an end. The point of holding a second round was to try to restore some legitimacy to the process after there was so much fraud - almost a third of votes for President Karzai were invalidated because of massive ballot stuffing. It is a very unsatisfactory end, not the end anyone here wished for. At the moment it is being seen as the best of a lot of bad options. But some questions are bound to remain over the legitimacy of the whole process. On Monday a spokesman for the Independent Election Commission (IEC), Azizullah Lodin, declared that President Karzai, "the only candidate for the second round", had been "elected president of Afghanistan".

Afghan policeman shoots and kills five British soldiers
Advertisement Five British soldiers have been shot dead in Helmand Province, in an attack the UK military blamed on a "rogue" Afghan policeman. The soldiers, three from the Grenadier Guards and two from the Royal Military Police, had been mentoring and living with the Afghan police in a compound. The officer opened fire, injuring eight others, before fleeing the compound. Gordon Brown told MPs the Taliban said they had carried out the attack and may have infiltrated Afghan police. Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister said evidence was being gathered and security would be stepped up after the shooting. But he added that training of Afghan police remained an "essential element" of the strategy in Afghanistan and would not be stopped as it was "what the Taliban fears most". Manhunt A total of 92 UK service personnel have now been killed this year, the highest annual figure since the Falklands War in 1982. An investigation is under way and the soldiers' next of kin have been informed of the deaths. A UK military spokesman said: "One individual Afghan National Policeman, possibly in conjunction with another, went rogue. Every effort is now being put into hunting down those responsible for this attack."

Political fallout from the sacking of Professor David Nutt gathers momentum
A second adviser to the government has resigned in protest at Home Secretary Alan Johnson's sacking of his chief drugs adviser, Prof David Nutt. Marion Walker's departure from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) followed the earlier resignation of Dr Les King. Dr King said he would like to see the ACMD become an independent body, free from the government's influence. Mr Johnson said Prof Nutt was sacked for "crossing a line" into politics. On Sunday, Prof Nutt revealed Ms Walker, ACMD member from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, had stepped down. However, she could not be reached for comment. I'm not going to say just how many I think might resign but there is an extremely angry feeling among most council members Dr Les King Ms Walker is clinical director of Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust's substance misuse service. Prof Nutt said her departure "means we have no-one now looking at that vast group of people who prescribe drugs and advise people about drugs, drug harms from the over-the-counter and prescription side". The BBC understands that several other members of the ACMD, who are unpaid for their work on the council, are considering their positions, in response to Prof Nutt's dismissal. Prof Nutt was sacked after calling cannabis less harmful than alcohol and tobacco, and saying it was upgraded to Class B for political reasons. HAVE YOUR SAY Scientific advisers should advise; ministers should then make decisions based on that advice... This sorry lot can't even get that right Steve, Fordingbridge, UK There was "very strong feeling" among the council's members over Prof Nutt's sacking, Dr King said.

Toyota quits Formula One
The loss of another giant company from the F1 grid may help smaller, independent teams to survive and thrive in the long run Toyota's decision to quit Formula One is a sign of a 32-year low in car sales in Japan and huge losses for the world's largest motor manufacturer. It is not, however, another nail in the coffin of Formula One. If anything, the loss of another manufacturer on the heels of Honda and BMW hints at a slow return towards the smaller independent team such as Williams and Brawn with racing as its core business. When Honda quit in December 2008, Toyota were expected to follow sooner rather than later. But the racing team's signature on a new Concorde agreement – the latest document governing Formula One until the end of 2012 – indicated a serious commitment despite Toyota not having won a race since the Japanese firm's move from international rallying to Formula One in 2002. The first hint of prevarication came last month when Toyota did not rush to re-sign Jarno Trulli and Timo Glock, although discussions with Kimi Raikkonen (leaving Ferrari) gave the impression that the team would continue. Estimates of Toyota's F1 budget vary but an annual figure of £300m would be close to an expensive mark for a team who have recorded just 13 podium finishes and, at best, fourth in the 2005 championship after 139 races. It is a sign of the huge losses at home that the Toyota Motor Corporation is willing to deal with the redundancy associated with more than 700 people at the team's headquarters in Cologne as well as facing compensation costs for breaking its commitment to stay in F1. Toyota, like Honda, struggled to make the F1 operation work thanks to a failure to understand that racing teams think on their feet rather than rely on cumbersome corporate decision-making by a committee thousands of miles away. Toyota's more complex and sprawling operation is less likely to be saved in the same way. The only good news is that Toyota's withdrawal leaves a space on the entry list for BMW to return in their new guise. Even though Toyota's F1 budget is minuscule in the firm's overall scheme of finance, motor manufacturers cannot afford to be seen to be spending money on a sport that may be considered frivolous when vast losses and redundancies are occurring within the core business.

Thirteen dead, several wounded in Fort Hood, Texas shooting
Fort Hood, the largest base in the US, was put under lockdown in the wake of the shootings [AFP] Fort Hood, the largest base in the US, was put under lockdown in the wake of the shootings [AFP] The dead gunman had been named as Major Malik Nadal Hasan, a 39-year-old army psychiatrist. Al Jazeera's Josh Rushing, reporting from Fort Hood, said there was no indication of motive for the unprecedented attack, which he said had left an atmosphere of "shock and fear" at the base. Recent US mass shootings April 3, 2009: Jiverly Wong, a Vietnamese immigrant, opens fire at an immigrant community centre in Binghamton, New York, killing 11 immigrants and two workers. Wong killed himself at the scene  March 10, 2009: Michael McLendon, 28, killed 10 people, including his Mother and four other family members in Alabama before himself committing suicide.

According to military officials, Hasan had been about to deploy overseas, although it was unclear if he was destined for Iraq or Afghanistan or when he was scheduled to leave. Some other bases across the US also stepped up security in the wake of the shootings. Christopher Hogue, chief of media at Fort Hood, told reporters: "The only one we know who was shooting was killed and he had two handguns." The alleged shooter was included in the total of 12 killed. "It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an army base on American soil," he said in Washington.

Most of the criticism in the Goldstone report was directed towards Israel's conduct during the offensive, in which human rights organisations say about 1,400 Palestinians - many of them women and children - were killed. Thirteen Israelis, including three civilians, were killed over the course of the war. The report concluded that Israel used disproportionate force in the war, deliberately targeting Gaza civilians, using them as human shields, and destroying civilian infrastructure. It is a call for justice and accountability". "Without justice, there can be no progress towards peace. A human being should be treated as a human being, regardless of his or her religion, race or nationality," he said. The Netherlands' representative said, however, he supported elements in the text, which sought to pursue inquiries into violations of human rights and international law. Jorge Valero, Venezuela's ambassador to the UN, endorsing the report, said Israel should be brought to justice for crimes against Palestinians, and those responsible for the "operation of terror". Nassir Abdulaziz al-Nasser, Qatar's ambassador to the UN, said the Goldstone report pointed to crimes committed by the Israel that amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, torture and serious physical and psychological harm to civilians.

China offers Africa financial aid including $10 billion in loans
China has cultivated strong economic ties with Africa China has pledged to give Africa $10bn (£6bn) in concessional loans over the next three years, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has said at a summit in Egypt. The Chinese leader is attending a two-day forum on China-Africa cooperation in Sharm el-Sheikh, attended by officials from 50 nations. "We will help Africa build up financing capacity," Mr Wen told the summit. Several heads of state and government are attending the meeting, including the Presidents of Sudan and Zimbabwe. Mr Wen also said China is planning to create environmental programmes for Africa, including 100 clean energy projects. Advertisement The West has previously accused China of plundering Africa's natural resources - to fuel its booming economy - and of overlooking the human rights records of some governments they do business with. In the run up to the summit, China's state owned Global Times newspaper wrote "The West is envious of China and Africa drawing closer," and quoted one Chinese Africa expert as saying "Europeans view Africa as their own backyard." China pledged $5bn (£3bn) of assistance at the last cooperation summit in Beijing in 2006, and signed agreements to relieve or cancel the debt of more than 30 African countries. SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao vowed to further China-Africa economic and trade cooperation during the 3rd Conference of Chinese and African Entrepreneurs held on Saturday afternoon in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. In his speech, Wen highly valued the fruitful achievements China and Africa have made through bilateral economic and trade cooperation. He said past practices had proved that the traditional friendship between China and Africa was "unbreakable," and their economic and trade cooperation was based on equality and mutual benefit.

Korean navies exchange fire
SEOUL, South Korea  North and South Korean naval vessels exchanged fire in disputed waters off the western coast of the Korean Peninsula on Tuesday, leaving one North Korean vessel engulfed in flames, South Korean officials said. One North Korean sailor was killed and three others injured, according to MBC, a South Korean television station. The South Korean defense minister, Kim Tae-young, told Parliament that he could not confirm the report. The two Koreas accused each other of violating territorial waters, provoking the fierce two-minute skirmish. It was the first border fighting in seven years between the countries, which technically remain at war after fighting in the 1950-3 Korean War ended in a truce rather than a permanent peace treaty. The clash underlined the instability in the region just days before President Obama begins a weeklong visit to Asia. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program will be a leading topic not only when Mr. Obama meets with the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, in Seoul next week but also during bilateral talks that American officials say they will begin soon with the North. Ahead of those talks, North Korea may have intended for the clash to highlight its longstanding argument that the war between the Koreas from 1950-53 never officially ended and that the United States must negotiate a peace treaty if it wants North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, according to analysts in Seoul. South Korea issued a statement after the skirmish saying it had suffered no casualties. “We are fully prepared for further provocations from the North Korean military.” Speaking in Parliament, Prime Minister Chung Un-chan said the North Korean boat limped back to its waters “enveloped in flames.” Hours later, North Korea demanded an apology from the South for a “grave armed provocation.” According to South Korean officials, fighting erupted when a 215-ton North Korean vessel ventured across the so-called Northern Limit Line, a sea border drawn by the United Nations at the end of the war.

Three more scientists resign from UK ACMD drugs advisory council
Alan Johnson failed in an attempt to defuse the damaging row between the Government and Britain's top scientists after three more of his drugs advisers resigned last night. The Home Secretary suffered a setback when another three members of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs resigned despite his efforts to reassure them in more than an hour of peace talks that the Government would respect the independence of its expert advisers. The growing rift between ministers and the scientific community was sparked by Mr Johnson's decision to sack the body's chairman, Professor David Nutt, for allegedly campaigning against the Government's decision to upgrade cannabis to a Class B drug. Another two members of the 31-strong council, Marion Walker and Dr Les King, resigned in protest and they were joined by three more members last night, leaving the group without experts in key areas of expertise. Allies of Mr Johnson said they were saddened by the resignations but insisted the Council was still viable and that most of its members wanted to carry on their vital work. It is believed the Council was divided after yesterday's tense session with Mr Johnson. Some members wanted to accept his safeguards over their future work but others remained unhappy, accusing the Government of prejudging the review of cannabis ordered by Gordon Brown when he became Prime Minister. The Home Secretary promised his drug advisers yesterday that their views will be given "due weight" in future and acknowledged the need to improve relations with the Council. "I understand why the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs was concerned about this, said Mr Johnson. He added: "There is a duty I think to accept that politicians make the final decision.

Herman Van Rompuy named as first permanent EU President
Mr Van Rompuy was widely tipped, but Baroness Ashton was not EU leaders have chosen the Belgian Prime Minister, Herman van Rompuy, to be the first permanent European Council President. The other top job created by the Lisbon Treaty - foreign affairs supremo - has gone to the EU Trade Commissioner, Baroness Catherine Ashton from the UK. Both are seen as consensual politicians with limited foreign policy experience. Both had unanimous backing from the 27 EU leaders at the summit in Brussels, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. Earlier, the UK government had said it was no longer pushing for former PM Tony Blair to get the presidency post. Mr Van Rompuy, 62, had crucial French and German support. He has a reputation as a coalition builder, having taken charge of the linguistically divided Belgian government and steered it out of a crisis. "Every country should emerge victorious from negotiations," he told a news conference after his appointment. Baroness Ashton, 53, said she felt "deeply privileged" to get the foreign affairs post. "I was the first woman British commissioner, the first woman trade commissioner, so I am also proud to be the first woman High Representative," she said. "I think there was a strong push to have at least one woman in a senior position," she told the BBC later, adding that she hoped Europe would become "an economic superpower".

US healthcare bill passes Senate vote
The U.S. Senate, by a vote of 60 to 39, has decided to begin debate on legislation crafted by majority Democrats to reform the country's health care system. The measure, opposed by Republican senators, was voted on late Saturday. One Republican Senator, George Voinovich of Ohio, was not present and did not vote. It was not clear until earlier in the day whether the Democrats would have enough votes to bring the bill to the Senate floor for for full debate. During the day Saturday, two moderate Democrats announced they would support the move during a rare Saturday session. That gave the Democrats the 60 votes they needed to move the measure forward. In the rare Saturday Senate session, opposition Republicans criticized the bill, saying it would drive up the cost of insurance and add to the nation's deficit. In a statement, Gibbs said the president looks forward to a thorough and productive debate. While Democrats won the vote to begin debate, passage of the bill is not certain. Some moderate Democrats have signaled strong opposition to components of the bill, including a government-run option to compete with private insurers. However, the Senate version does allow states to opt out of the public option. The Congressional Budget Office said the Senate bill unveiled Wednesday would cost $849 billion over the next decade.

British Climatic Research Unit's emails hacked
The scientific community is buzzing over thousands of emails and documents -- posted on the Internet last week after being hacked from a prominent climate-change research center -- that some say raise ethical questions about a group of scientists who contend humans are responsible for global warming. The correspondence between dozens of climate-change researchers, including many in the U.S., illustrates bitter feelings among those who... Hundreds of private e-mail messages and documents hacked from a computer server at a British university are causing a stir among global warming skeptics, who say they show that climate scientists conspired to overstate the case for a human influence on climate change. The e-mail messages, attributed to prominent American and British climate researchers, include discussions of scientific data and whether it should be released, exchanges about how best to combat the arguments of skeptics, and casual comments  in some cases derisive  about specific people known for their skeptical views. Drafts of scientific papers and a photo collage that portrays climate skeptics on an ice floe were also among the hacked data, some of which dates back 13 years. In another, a scientist refers to climate skeptics as “idiots.” Some skeptics asserted Friday that the correspondence revealed an effort to withhold scientific information. “This is not a smoking gun; this is a mushroom cloud,” said Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist who has long faulted evidence pointing to human-driven warming and is criticized in the documents. Some of the correspondence portrays the scientists as feeling under siege by the skeptics’ camp and worried that any stray comment or data glitch could be turned against them. The evidence pointing to a growing human contribution to global warming is so widely accepted that the hacked material is unlikely to erode the overall argument. In several e-mail exchanges, Kevin Trenberth, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other scientists discuss gaps in understanding of recent variations in temperature. Skeptic Web sites pointed out one line in particular: “The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t,” Dr. Trenberth wrote. The cache of e-mail messages also includes references to journalists, including this reporter, and queries from journalists related to articles they were reporting.

Israel announces 10 month halt to settlement construction in West Bank
Al Jazeera's Jacky Rowland, reporting from Jerusalem, said that the suspension would only apply to "new residential permits and new residential starts". "We are only talking about housing here. This freeze does not apply to public buildings such as schools or police stations or whatever, and it also means any existing building permits that have been granted they will go ahead," she said. "Any construction which has already begun, any construction sites where the cement mixers are already whirring and the cranes are at work they will continue." Palestinian rejection  A spokesman for Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, earlier dismissed the Israeli plan after details of it were outlined in a statement from Netanyahu's office. "Any return to negotiations must be on the basis of a complete settlement freeze, and in Jerusalem foremost," Nabil Abu Rdainah said. Referring to Jerusalem in Wednesday's news conference, Netanyahu said: "My position it is well known, I do not impose any restriction on building in Jerusalem." The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, has refused to return to peace talks with the Israelis until Netanyahu orders a complete freeze to all settlement building work in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Before Netanyahu's news conference, Ehud Barak, the Israeli defence minister, told the security cabinet that the proposal was an attempt to "keep open a window to the resumption of the negotiation process" with the Palestinians. "Israel is strong and determined, but time is not necessarily on our side, and it is important to move towards two states for two people, through agreement. "It falls short of a full settlement freeze, but it is more than any Israeli government has done before," he said. "It falls short of a full settlement freeze, but it is more than any Israeli government has done before" George Mitchell, US special Middle East envoy "As President Obama has said many times, we believe that a two-state solution to the conflict is the best way to realise the shared goal of Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security.

US President Obama delivers address on Afghanistan plan
Advertisement US President Barack Obama has ordered 30,000 more US troops to Afghanistan but warned America would begin to withdraw its military forces by 2011. Soldiers will be deployed as quickly as possible, bringing US troop strength in the country to more than 100,000. World security was at stake, Mr Obama said, calling for more allied troops. The mission in Afghanistan, he added, was to defeat al-Qaeda, reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny them the ability to overthrow the government. Just as we have done in Iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly Barack Obama Full text of speech Nato pledges 5,000 Afghan troops US media on the troop surge Afghan concern over pullout date Mr Obama reached his deployment decision after more than three months of deliberations and 10 top-level meetings with advisers. Gen Stanley McChrystal, the US commander in Afghanistan, welcomed the speech, saying he had been given "a clear military mission" and the necessary resources. Some 32,000 other foreign troops are serving in Afghanistan but Nato allies have been cautious about further contributions. Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen urged members to do more. He told reporters on Wednesday that 5,000 extra troops would be sent in 2010, and "probably" a few thousand in addition. "This is our fight together," he said. Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta said that with international help Afghanistan's armed forces would be able to start taking responsibility for security in 18 months.

Guinean military leader in 'favourable' condition after attempted assassination
Morocco says Guinea's military ruler has undergone successful surgery for gunshot wounds sustained on Thursday in an apparent assassination attempt. Guinea's military government is offering a reward for the capture of the former head of the presidential guard whose men are accused of carrying out the attack. The inspector of Morocco's Royal Armed Forces' health services says Guinea's military ruler Captain Moussa Dadis Camara has had successful surgery for head trauma. In a statement issued by Morocco's official press agency, Dr. Ali Abrouq said Captain Camara's condition is "not worrying." Captain Camara flew to Morocco on Friday after being shot the day before by men loyal to his former aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Aboubacar Sidiki Diakite, who is also known as Toumba. Toumba escaped the attack and is still at large with a group of the presidential guard. The government is offering a reward for information leading to his capture. Toumba's photograph is being broadcast on national television. Thursday's shooting followed an argument between Toumba and Captain Camara about who should take responsibility for the killing of opposition demonstrators two months ago. Captain Camara has not yet announced his candidacy, but he has told several regional diplomats that he intends to run for president.

Copenhagen climate conference opens
Prime minister tells the Guardian he hopes the EU will agree to a cut in emissions of 30% by 2020 Gordon Brown is pushing European leaders to commit to deeper cuts in carbon emissions in an attempt to seal a global deal, he revealed as representatives of 192 countries began negotiations at the climate change summit in Copenhagen. The prime minister told the Guardian he hoped the EU would agree to cut its output of greenhouse gases by 30% on 1990 levels by 2020 – a cut 10 percentage points deeper than Europe is currently offering. So far, the EU has said it will cut by 30% only if an ambitious global deal is reached. Brown said: "We've got to make countries recognise that they have to be as ambitious as they say they want to be. It's not enough to say 'I may do this, I might do this, possibly I'll do this'. I want to create a situation in which the European Union is persuaded to go to 30%." Because the UK is already racing to build renewable energy as fast as it can, the additional cuts would probably require measures such as road charging, increased fuel taxes and tougher emissions standards for cars. On the opening day of the Copenhagen summit Saudi Arabia's chief climate negotiator, Mohammed al-Sabban, told delegates that the scandal over hacked emails from University of East Anglia researchers had undermined confidence in the science of climate change and would "affect the nature of what can be trusted in the negotiations". But after lambasting climate deniers as "flat-earth sceptics" and "anti-change Luddites", Brown would say only that he "fundamentally disagrees" with Sabban, who last week said he believed there was no link between human behaviour and warming. The prime minister's call for Europe to increase its "level of ambition" came as the expert committee charged with setting Britain's carbon targets published a report suggesting that higher flight taxes will be necessary to choke off demand for air travel. But it warned that development at other regional airports such as Gatwick, Birmingham and Newcastle would have to be curbed if growth in aviation was to be kept to 60% rather than the 200% by which it would expand if allowed to go unchecked.

Danish unofficial draft version of UNCCC treaty leaks, G77 reacts sharply
By Richard Black Environment correspondent, BBC News website, Copenhagen The leaked text has overshadowed the first day's upbeat speeches Earth Watch - Richard Black's blog Documents leaked at the UN climate summit reveal divisions between industrialised and developing countries over the shape of a possible new deal. Campaigners say a draft text proposed by the Danish host government would disadvantage poorer nations. It also sees everything coming under a single new deal, whereas an alternative text from developing countries wants an extension to the Kyoto Protocol. Other blocs are expected to release their own texts in the next few days. Chairmen of working groups will then have to turn the various documents into a political document that 100-odd world leaders, plus delegates representing all other nations, could sign at the end of the conference. The Danish document, plus the alternative text submitted by the BASIC group (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) were discussed by a small group of key countries in Copenhagen last week. But the Danish proposal had remained under wraps until The Guardian newspaper published it on its website during the second afternoon of the conference. More ambition The documents show that at the broadest level, developed and developing worlds are split on several points: the level of cuts from developed countries the establishment of a target date by which global emissions should peak and begin to fall most fundamentally, the shape of any future deal. Although this might appear a technical point, developing countries have so far remained adamant on the retention of the protocol because of the measures it contains on financial assistance and technology transfer, and because it is the only legally binding treaty in existence that makes countries reduce emissions. The only formal texts in the UN process are the ones tabled by the Chairs of this Copenhagen conference at the behest of the parties Yvo de Boer, UNFCCC executive secretary Copenhagen: Your questions The Danish text sets out a vision of greenhouse gas emissions peaking globally by 2020, then declining.

Oxford to use online voting for Professor of Poetry election
Oxford University tonight announced changes to the centuries-old tradition of voting for its professor of poetry post, instead introducing processes that bring it something closer to the 21st century. The vote, every five years, has been called a "kamikaze convention", and this year descended into embarrassing farce when Ruth Padel felt compelled to resign after nine days in the job. Any member of Oxford's convocation, which includes all 300,000 or so Oxford graduates, can vote as long as they turn up in person on a given day. Oxford hopes to avoid a repeat of this year's election which saw Padel quit after she was implicated in a smear campaign against her main rival, Derek Walcott. Walcott, a Nobel laureate, pulled out of the election when details of a sexual harassment claim made against him by a student at Harvard in 1982 became a dominant theme of the campaign. Oxford now hopes to fill the post, vacant since Sir Christopher Ricks finished his five-year term last year, by autumn 2010. But some believe the voting changes could make the election even more of a bun fight. Judith Palmer, director of the Poetry Society, said: "It just feels like they are not addressing the bigger problems. The contest is notoriously bruising, and there have been many excellent poets who would not dream of putting themselves forward because they don't want to take part in the showbiz aspect of it all.

Thousands of Indonesians protest against corruption
Though activists predicted that hundreds of thousands would march Wednesday against corruption in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, only a few thousand turned up. Most were students protesting the latest corruption scandal in the country. It involves allegations that a $600 million government bailout was given to Century Bank on condition that some of the money be used to fund the president's re-election campaign. The legislature is investigating the bailout and the possible roles played by Vice President Boediono and Finance Minister Sri Mulyani in orchestrating a deal. Many of the demonstrators, like Ridwan Laodabone with a Muslim student organization, already consider the vice president and finance minister guilty. He says he wants the president to fire those two officials. Jakarta University student Adi Prasetyo says Indonesia should follow China's example of executing some corrupt officials. Most rallies were without incident but in Makassar in South Sulawesi, students armed with rocks and wooden planks clashed with anti-riot police. The news media report that police fired tear gas to break up the crowd after protesters tried to storm the provincial governor's office. On Saturday President Suslio Bambang Yudhoyono was critical of some anti-corruption activists, saying they are politically motivated and want only to discredit and topple his presidency.

Protesters arrested at climate change rally
Thousands of people march as part of a global protest to demand that governments agree a new climate deal Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Copenhagen today as part of a global protest to demand governments across the world agree a binding new global deal to tackle climate change. The march and rally in the Danish capital, the world's largest ever protest about global warming, comes at the halfway point of the United Nations' climate summit in the city. "Let's dance, sing and be happy, because power is in your hands," Nnimmo Bassey, director of Friends of the Earth International told the crowd, as he kicked off the first part of the march, the Flood, from Halmtorvet. Official police estimates put the number of protesters at 25,000, but organisers said as many as 100,000 had joined the march from central Copenhagen, waving banners that read "Nature doesn't compromise" and "Climate Justice Now". Although most of the march has been peaceful, a small group threw bricks at police early on. So far there have been 21 arrests, and police are currrently kettling about 200-300 marchers in Amagerbrogade. We decided to go for preventive detentions to give the peaceful demonstration the possibility to move on." To mark the Global Day of Action on climate change, campaigners were also staging events around the world, including a four-minute "flashdance" with lights outside the Houses of Parliament, with volunteers across London collecting messages from citizens to deliver to MPs. Phil Thornhill, from the Campaign against Climate Change in the UK, said on behalf of the Global Climate Campaign: "Every year of inaction sees us slide closer to the point where a tragedy of unprecedented scale becomes irreversible. "As politicians fail to find the collective will to overcome inertia, international rivalries, and the all-pervasive power of vested interests, ordinary people all around the world will be demanding decisive action now, not later when the fate of billions could be already have been sealed and the catastrophe will have become unstoppable." She told Sky News it was "inspiring", adding: "It's fantastic to join with so many other people from all over the world.

North Korean weapons seized in Thailand
Thailand will charge detained crew members with crimes related to trafficking the 35-ton arms shipment in violation of sanctions slapped on North Korea for its missile and nuclear tests. Thai authorities have intercepted a cache of grenades, rocket launchers, and other heavy arms from North Korea after the plane carrying them was forced to land in Bangkok for fuel. Acting on a tip from the United States and in line with United Nations sanctions, Thailand is now trying to piece together where the weapons were headed. The five crew members, four with Kazakh passports and one from Belarus, have all been arrested but remained tight-lipped. Thailand will charge them with crimes related to trafficking the 35-ton arms shipment in violation of sanctions slapped on North Korea for its missile and nuclear tests in spring, reports Reuters. Sri Lanka's Daily Mirror says authorities there denied that, adding: "Some believe the crew of the detained aircraft may have indicated they were heading for Sri Lanka in order to conceal their actual destination." One Sri Lankan military official told Reuters, "Why should Sri Lanka buy from North Korea when the same is available in China?" This is the first time a North Korean plane has been caught in the UN dragnet since its spring resolution imposing sanctions. India in August detained a North Korean vessel it deemed suspicious, but it turned out to be full of sugar. A month prior, a North Korean boat appeared to be headed for Burma (Myanmar) high-tailed it home after being trailed by the US Navy. "If the Thai government's announcement is true that North Korean weapons were on board, measures should be taken against the apparent violation of UN resolutions," it quoted an anonymous official at Seoul's Foreign Ministry as saying.

Democratic holdout agrees to support health care reform in US
The spotlight was on moderate Democratic Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who had been the last holdout as Senate Democrats raced against the clock and against determined Republican opposition to pass their health care bill by their self-imposed deadline of December 25th, Christmas. Nelson said he is now ready to vote for cloture, which would advance the bill. "Change is never easy, but change is what is necessary in American today and and that is why I intend to vote for cloture, I intend to vote for cloture and for health care reform," he said. Nelson said he decided to support the bill after winning new concessions from Democratic Senate Majority leader Harry Reid to limit the availability of abortions in insurance sold under the new legislation. The legislation would extend health benefits to more than 30 million uninsured Americans and impose new regulations on the health insurance industry. Senator Reid of Nevada has been working for months to win over one holdout Democratic senator after another, repeatedly altering the bill to satisfy different demands. "The broken system cannot continue and it will not continue. When President Obama signs this bill into law, we will officially end the era in which insurance companies win only when patients lose," he said. Nelson's support should pave the way for Senate Democrats to win the first of a series of crucial procedural votes scheduled to begin at one o'clock in the morning (0600 GMT) Monday and set to conclude - if everything goes smoothly for them - with final passage on Christmas Eve. Republicans have been using a number of parliamentary procedures to delay action on the bill, including forcing a reading on the Senate floor Saturday of Reid's 338-pages of last minute amendments. "And Democrats are forcing a vote on it, as I indicated, over the weekend, counting on the fact that the American people are preoccupied with Christmas and not paying much attention to what they are doing," he said. Republicans are unified in their opposition, saying the bill is too expensive and will not solve the problems with the current health care system.

Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri dies
Students chanting pro-reform slogans filled university campuses following the death of the Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri from a heart attack at the age of 87. His grandson, Nasser Montazeri, said he had died in his sleep. Ayatollah Montazeri was originally a follower of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary, and was seen in the 1980s as his natural successor. But he came to oppose the dictatorial nature of the regime, particularly its mass executions of members of an opposition movement in the years before Ayatollah Khomeini's death, and ended up one of its fiercest critics. Nevertheless, he remained in Qom, the holy city seen as the regime's birthplace, and supporters were converging on the city from all over the country to attend his funeral, due to take place today/Monday. "My grandfather died in his sleep last night," said Nasser Montazeri. Tagheer, the website of the reformist defeated election candidate Mehdi Karroubi said: "The social network of the reform movement has called on its supporters to gather in Mohseni Square (in Tehran) to mourn. Based on reports people have already gathered in some other squares in Tehran." By yesterday evening more security forces had been put on alert out of fear the funeral could become yet another focus for opposition rallies. Videos were already being posted by midafternoon on YouTube of impromptu gatherings at universities of students who chanted slogans in his memory.

Two killed, 47 injured in coach crash in Cornwall, England
The first police car to arrive at the scene also crashed Two women have died and another 47 people have been injured in a coach crash on a country road in Cornwall. The coach rolled on to its side after skidding on sheet ice on an ungritted road in Townshend, near Hayle. The passengers were returning from a trip to see Christmas lights 14 miles away in Mousehole when the crash happened at 2215 GMT on Tuesday. The first police car at the scene also skidded and crashed into the coach, owned by local firm Williams Travel. The two officers inside the vehicle were not injured. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those passengers who sadly died, and also all the other passengers who were on the coach Garry Williams, Williams Travel Passengers say crash was 'horrific' Coach driver 'avoided bigger tragedy' Supt Tim Swarbrick said: "It's a tragedy at this time of the year and our thoughts are with the families of all those involved." He said: "The effective response from emergency services, combined with the local community's willingness to help, resulted in the delivery of high quality care to a large number of patients in very challenging circumstances." The other is believed to have died after being taken to hospital. The operations manager at Camborne-based Williams Travel, Garry Williams, said: "I attended Treliske Hospital to speak to the driver and a number of passengers, all of which said that the coach was unable to stop once it had come into contact with the black ice, and then turned over onto its side and ended up in a ditch. "All were amazed that this road was not gritted, which is a regular road used by those who go to see the Christmas lights.

U.S. Senate passes landmark health care reform bill
3590 as amended, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is passed," Vice President Joe Biden announced. The vice president presided over the Senate at the time of the vote. As expected, Republicans voted against the bill while all Democrats and two Independents voted for it. At an estimated $87 billion, the measure would expand health insurance coverage to about 30 million more Americans currently without it, create new private insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, to expand choice. And, like the slightly more expensive measure passed by the House of Representatives, it would end a practice by private insurance companies of denying coverage to individuals with existing health problems. Both the Senate and House measures would require nearly all Americans to purchase some form of insurance, while lower-income Americans would receive help from federal government subsidies. In remarks before the vote, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said opponents had done everything they could to prevent the vote from taking place. Speaking to reporters, Reid and others hailed the vote as a victory and a major step toward providing millions more Americans with access to health care. "This is a victory because we have affirmed that the ability to live a healthy life in our great country is a right and not merely a privilege for the select few," Reid said. Reid and others paid tribute to to Senator Edward Kennedy, who died this past August after spending decades of his career in the Senate pursuing health care reform. In the final hours of debate on the Senate bill, Republicans asserted it would be ineffective and add sharply to the U.S. budget deficit. Jeff Sessions is a Republican from Alabama:  "This legislation may have a great vision, it may have a great idea about trying to make the system work better.

Failed bomb aboard Delta flight
The plane was carrying 278 passengers An incident on an airliner arriving in the US city of Detroit from Amsterdam in the Netherlands was a failed bomb attack, senior US officials say. Sources say a man burnt his leg trying to ignite explosives on the jet, which had 278 passengers and 11 crew aboard, but nobody else was seriously hurt. In custody, the Nigerian suspect said he had been acting on behalf of al-Qaeda, a police source said. President Barack Obama has ordered increased security for air travel. Northwest Airlines Flight 253 had been about 20 minutes away from landing at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Friday afternoon when the incident occurred. Melinda Dennis, a passenger, said the man had been severely burned on one leg, and a fire extinguisher and water were used to put out the fire.

Deaths in Philippines ferry accidents
Distraught relatives waited for news in Batangas City At least three people have died and 22 remain missing after a ferry sank in waters south of the Philippines capital, Manila, the coast guard says. The vessel was carrying 88 passengers and crew when it went down near Batangas City. Ships in the area rescued more than 60 people. Up to 24 people are still missing after that vessel and a fishing boat collided in darkness in Manila Bay. In the latest tragedy, survivors said the roll-on ferry listed and sank after taking in water from the bow ramp. There were dozens of people on the water crying for help and calling out the names of their family members Eric Musngi Survivor Philippine vessels collide at sea Three passing ships helped rescue teams pick up survivors from the MV Baleno-9 vessel, and the search was continuing on Sunday. "There were dozens of people on the water crying for help and calling out the names of their family members," passenger Eric Musngi told a radio interview, reports Reuters news agency. "I don't know what happened to my mother and elder sister." Sea accidents are common in the archipelago of more than 7,100 islands because of tropical storms and poor safety regulations. Last year, more than 800 people died after a ferry overturned during a typhoon in the central Philippines. Balilo said passengers were equipped with a sufficient number of life vests and emergency rafts.

Nigerian man charged with trying to blow up airliner
At the same time, a jittery air travel system coped with a new scare. On the same flight that Mr. Abdulmutallab took on Friday — Northwest 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit — an ailing Nigerian man who spent a long time in the restroom inadvertently set off a security alert. It turned out to be a false alarm. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Officials in several countries, meanwhile, worked to retrace Mr. Abdulmutallab’s path and to look for security holes. In Nigeria, officials said he arrived in Lagos on Christmas Eve, just hours before departing for Amsterdam. American officials were tracking his travels to Yemen, and Scotland Yard investigators were checking on his connections in London, where he studied from 2005 to 2008 at University College London and was president of the Islamic Society. Obama administration officials scrambled to portray the episode, in which passengers and flight attendants subdued Mr. Abdulmutallab and doused the fire he had started, as a test that the air safety system passed. “The system has worked really very, very smoothly over the course of the past several days,” Janet Napolitano, the Homeland Security secretary said, in an interview on “This Week” on ABC. Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, used nearly the same language on “Face the Nation” on CBS, saying that “in many ways, this system has worked.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story But counterterrorism experts and members of Congress were hardly willing to praise what they said was a security system that had proved to be not nimble enough to respond to the ever-creative techniques devised by would-be terrorists.

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, the ranking minority member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said that his visa should have been revoked, or that he at least should have been given a physical pat-down or a full-body scan.

Elvish, Klingon and Na'vi: Constructed languages gain foothold in film
In the run-up to the release of his sci-fi blockbuster Avatar , James Cameron has been proclaiming the richness of the Na'vi language spoken by the film's jungle-planet aliens. The Klingon language (or tlhIngan Hol as diehard Trekkies know it) not only raised the bar for Hollywood alien-speak, with its full grammar rules and relatively wide vocabulary. Developed by linguist Marc Okrand for the Star Trek films (beginning with Star Trek III ) and subsequent TV series, the guttural Klingon was based around many of the most uncommon grammar structures and consonant sounds of real-world languages, to make it sound all the more alien. The late UCLA linguist Victoria Fromkin is often credited for being one of the first to devise a full dialect for alien characters, with her language for the primates in the original Land of the Lost television series. Film and literature, though, brim with invented languages, from Nadsat in Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange to the Middle Earth languages of J.R.R. Clips with Avatar 's Na'vi language, developed by California professor Paul Frommer, seem to have the burr and open vowels of a kind of Latin-American Spanish patois, albeit by way of Africa. Frommer has said he came up with enough vocabulary to allow him to translate certain lines from the script quickly.

Somali pirates capture two ships
The St James Park issued a distress call on Monday night saying it had been attacked by pirates Somali pirates have captured two ships with 45 crew off the East African coast, officials say. A UK-flagged chemical tanker, the St James Park, was reportedly captured in the Gulf of Aden on Monday while on its way to Thailand from Spain. Its 26 crew hail from Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Georgia, India, Turkey and the Philippines. The Navios Apollon, a Panamanian-flagged Greek cargo ship with 19 crew, was hijacked north of the Seychelles. The 50,000-tonne carrier - which had been sailing from the US state of Florida to India - was boarded on Monday by 10 men in speedboats, according to the Greek coastguard. Pirate attacks have been common off the Somali coast and international navies have been deployed to counter them. 'No contact' The St James Park issued a distress call on Monday night saying it had been attacked by pirates, said the International Maritime Bureau. The tanker, which was carrying a cargo of chemicals used to make plastics, had changed course and was now heading towards the northern coast of Somalia, said Andrew Mwangura of the Seafarers Assistance Programme. "It is expected to arrive there later this evening," Mr Mwangura told AFP news agency. The ship's owner-operators told the BBC they were working for "the early and safe release of our crew members on board". A spokesman for Zodiac Maritime Agencies said the company had had no contact with the St James Park or the pirates but was in contact with the European naval force in the area. Correspondents say the upsurge in piracy in the region is a consequence of the failure to find a solution to Somalia's continuing political disarray.

Icelandic government passes Icesave deal; €12,000 debt per citizen
Icesave collapsed last October Iceland's parliament has approved plans to repay 3.8bn euros (£3.4bn) to savers in the UK and the Netherlands. The money will go to the British and Dutch governments, who partially compensated savers when the Icesave online bank failed. More than 320,000 savers lost out when the bank collapsed in 2008. A bill on the measure, narrowly approved against strong opposition, was seen as crucial to Iceland's bid to join the EU and rebuild its economy. The bill was passed by 33 votes to 30. The Icelandic government had threatened to resign if the measure was rejected. "Approving the bill is the better option and will avoid even more economic damage," Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson said during the debate. "History will show that we are doing the right thing." But the bill's opponents argue ordinary Icelanders should not have to pay and say the compensation amounts to some 12,000 euros for each citizen on the island nation of 320,000. An original agreement - negotiated with the British and Dutch governments - was approved in August. Under the new deal the money - which represents 40% of the country's gross domestic product - will be repaid gradually, staggered until 2024. The claim follows a guarantee made by the bank in 2008 to fulfil sponsor Hamleys' obligation, after the toy shop's Icelandic owner, retail group Baugur failed to pay up. Baugur took on significant debt after a spending spree of British high street chains House of Fraser, Oasis and Karen Millen and though the Hamleys logo continued to feature on the Williams cars, Glitnir took over payments.

Afghanistan suicide bomb leaves seven Americans dead
Afghanistan suicide bombing kills 8 CIA officers The Taliban takes responsibility for the explosion at a U.S. base in Khowst province where the agency has a major presence. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in a message posted early today on its Pashto-language website. The statement, attributed to spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, said the attacker was a member of the Afghan army who entered the base clad in his military uniform. It identified him only as Samiullah. A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the CIA had a major presence at the base, in part because of its strategic location. The attack took place at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khowst province, an area near the border with Pakistan that is a hotbed of insurgent activity. An undisclosed number of civilians were wounded, the officials said. Reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Rochester, N.Y. -- A bomber slipped into a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday and detonated a suicide vest, killing eight CIA officers in one of the deadliest days in the agency's history, current and former U.S. officials said. The casualties highlight the CIA's increasingly important role in Afghanistan, and come as the United States is embarking on a major buildup of its civilian workforce that parallels an increase in troop strength. A former U.S. intelligence official knowledgeable about the bombing said it killed more CIA personnel than any attack since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983. Before Wednesday's attack, four CIA operatives had been killed in Afghanistan, the former official said.

Afghanistan's parliament rejects Karzai's cabinet nominations
Afghanistan's parliament dealt a blow to President Hamid Karzai Saturday, rejecting most of his nominees for a new Cabinet. It took parliament hours to count the yellow paper ballots cast secretly by more than 200 lawmakers. But after each of the nominees was deemed either "accepted" or "rejected," the verdict was clear. Parliament gave a vote of no confidence to 17 of the 24 Cabinet nominees picked by President Hamid Karzai. Mr. Karzai had hoped the power-broker would serve a second term as energy minister. The Cabinet's only female member also lost her job as Women's Affairs minister by just two votes. Forming the Cabinet is Mr. Karzai's first test of governance after he secured a second term in office in elections marred by rampant fraud last August. The Afghan leader has pledged his new government will not be as corrupt as the last. Despite the concerns, Cabinet experience appears to have helped incumbent Interior Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar.

US, UK embassies in Yemen close due to al-Qaeda threat
The closures come after the two nations pledged to boost counter-terrorism support to the Yemeni government. The U.S. embassy's website said the threats come from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the group linked to the failed Christmas Day airplane bombing attempt in the United States. The Nigerian suspect in the case told U.S. authorities he received training from al-Qaida affiliates in Yemen. The closures come a day after U.S. General David Petraeus visited the capital, Sana'a, to discuss security issues with President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The influential general, who oversees the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, recently announced that Washington would more than double its security aid to the impoverished nation. Britain has also announced plans to join with the United States in funding a counter-terrorism police unit in Yemen, as well as plans to hold an international conference on Yemeni security later this month. Editor Hakim Almasmari, of the Yemen Post newspaper, thinks the conference might be advantageous if it results in more development projects for rural Yemen. The situation has gained new urgency as the government in Sana'a finds itself overwhelmed not only by the growing terrorist threat, but also two separate rebellions, one of which has become something of a proxy war, at least in rhetoric, between Iran and Saudi Arabia. U.S. military experts have warned that vast reaches of the impoverished nation, with its booming population and dwindling resources, could spin permanently out of the government's control.

Airport security tightened worldwide
Despite questions over the effectiveness of the devices, the prime minister said yesterday that passengers would see their "gradual" introduction, along with hand luggage checks for traces of explosives. Even those travelling through UK airports in transit would have to go through the heightened security screening. BAA, which runs six UK airports, said it would install the £100,000 machines "as soon as is practical" at Heathrow. Experts have cast doubt on whether the scanners are able to detect the type of explosive that 23-year-old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is accused of using in an attempt to blow up a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day. But Brown told BBC1's Andrew Marr show that the government would do everything in its power to tighten security. Four scanners have lain unused at Heathrow airport after EU advice that there were privacy and human rights implications, awaiting approval for use from the European commission, but a government source told the Guardian that these would now be deployed "with or without" the international co-operation that ministers said was needed after the recent bomb bid. The source pointed to the decision by Amsterdam's Schiphol airport to install the 17 scanners it bought two years ago but was unable to activate after receiving EU advice that there were privacy and human rights implications. Ben Wallace, a Conservative MP who before entering parliament was involved in a British defence firm's project to test the scanner's effect, said at the weekend that the kind of low-density materials used in the Christmas Day plot would not have been detected. Alongside the purchase of more scanners, a government source has told the Guardian that passenger profiling is "in the mix" of the security review's recommendations.

Suicide bomber at US base in Afghanistan was al-Qaeda double agent
U.S. media say a suicide bomber who attacked a CIA base in eastern Afghanistan last week was a Jordanian working as an al-Qaida double agent. The reports say current and former Western intelligence officials identified the suicide bomber as Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, a 36-year-old al-Qaida sympathizer from Zarqa, Jordan. U.S. network NBC says Jordanian authorities arrested al-Balawi more than a year ago and later recruited him to infiltrate al-Qaida, believing he had been successfully reformed. The CIA declined to comment on the reports. The bombing last Wednesday at the CIA base in Afghanistan's Khost province killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian officer. The U.S. military's intelligence chief in Afghanistan has criticized the work of U.S. spy agencies operating there, saying they are "ignorant" and out of touch with the Afghan people. General Michael Flynn says U.S. intelligence efforts have focussed too much on gathering information about insurgent groups in Afghanistan. He says U.S. intelligence has been unable to inform U.S. and NATO forces about the environment in which they operate and the Afghan people whom they seek to persuade.

Japanese survivor of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings dies, aged 93
Mr Yamaguchi had the bad luck to be in Hiroshima and then Nagasaki The only person officially recognised as having survived both atomic bombings in Japan at the end of World War II has died from stomach cancer, aged 93. Tsutomu Yamaguchi was in Hiroshima on a business trip on 6 August 1945 when a US plane dropped the first atomic bomb. He suffered serious burns and spent a night there before returning to his home city of Nagasaki just before it was bombed on 9 August. He said he hoped his experience held a lesson of peace for future generations. It was already recorded that Mr Yamaguchi had survived the Nagasaki bomb, but in March last year officials recognised he had been in Hiroshima as well. 'Precious storyteller' A handful or Japanese people are known to have lived through both attacks, but Mr Yamaguchi is the only one formally recognised by the Japanese government to have done so. More than 200,000 people were killed in the two atomic bombings Certification as a hibakusha or radiation survivor qualifies Japanese citizens for government compensation, including medical check-ups, and funeral costs. On learning of his official recognition last year, Mr Yamaguchi said: "My double radiation exposure is now an official government record. "It can tell the younger generation the horrifying history of the atomic bombings even after I die." In his later years, Mr Yamaguchi gave talks about his experiences as an atomic bomb survivor and emphasised his hope nuclear weapons would be abolished.

'Not guilty' plea from Abdulmutallab on Detroit jet bombing charges
Mr Abdulmutallab's court appearance lasted less than five minutes A "not guilty" plea has been entered on behalf of the Nigerian man accused of attempting to detonate a bomb on a Detroit-bound plane on Christmas Day. A Detroit judge took the action after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab declined to enter a plea during his first court appearance. Mr Abdulmutallab, 23, is charged with the attempted murder of 290 people and five other counts. Mr Abdulmutallab, wearing leg shackles, walked slowly into the court room. He confirmed his name and its spelling, as well as his age in a soft voice, prompting the judge to ask him to speak up. The man who faces six charges, including attempting to blow up a plane and kill the 289 other passengers and crew on 253 to Detroit on Christmas Day, hobbled in perhaps because of the injuries sustained or the leg irons he was wearing. A short young man, he sat in a chair and for several moments listened and nodded to his lawyers. He looked up slowly, his eyes staring with a slightly vacant look at the court. Abdulmutallab impassive in court Asked if he had had time to read the indictment, he answered "yes". Mr Abdulmutallab was treated for burns after his arrest at Detroit airport after he allegedly tried to detonate a device concealed in his underwear on Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit.

Gordon Brown says the UK won't run out of gas
Supply for gas in the UK has reached record levels over the last week Gordon Brown has pledged the UK's gas supplies will not run out during the current cold snap, and that road salt will get to "where it is most needed". The PM acknowledged the "worrying and frustrating" situation but said agencies were working together to keep the public "safe and warm". Meanwhile, National Grid also has issued its third 'balancing alert' in a week, aimed at adjusting gas supplies. Police have confirmed two more weather-related deaths, taking the total to 26. The cold weather is set to continue for the next few days at least, with more snow forecast overnight in some parts of the UK. National Grid had already issued and lifted two "balancing alerts" warning of a potential shortfall in supplies. These alerts help the market to consider increasing gas supplies, and encourage electricity providers to use alternative fuels such as coal. A spokeswoman said the third alert, which is due to end at 0600GMT on Sunday, was not due to the weather conditions but problems in the Norwegian gas fields. The spokeswoman said the market had already responded and supplies had come in from other sources. Earlier Mr Brown said the distributor had confirmed it expected to meet demand. The prime minister added: "We've got plenty of gas in our own back yard - the North Sea - and we also have access to the large reserves in Norway and Netherlands via pipelines."

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) listens to remarks after the U.S. Senate approved President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul on Capitol Hill in Washington, in this December 24, 2009 file photo. REUTERS/Jim Young WASHINGTON The Republican Party chief called on Senator Harry Reid on Sunday to step down as Senate majority leader over racial comments about President Barack Obama, while Democrats tried to put the issue behind them. Reid, a key figure in pushing Obama's agenda through Congress, apologized to the president on Saturday over remarks published in a new book calling Obama a "light-skinned" black man "with no Negro dialect unless he wanted to have one." Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said Reid should step aside as Senate majority leader, saying if a Republican made the same remarks Democrats would be "screaming for his head." "Oh yeah, there's a big double standard here," Steele, who is black, said on the NBC program "Meet the Press." "There is this standard where the Democrats feel that they can say these things and they can apologize when it ... comes from the mouths of their own. But if it comes from anyone else, it's racism," Steele added on "Fox News Sunday." Steele said Reid used "anachronistic language," adding, "It harkens back to the 1950s and 60s, and it confirms to me a mind-set that's out of step with where America is today." Asked if his own words were a racial slur, Steele said, "Well, if it is, I apologize for it.

Explosion in Afghanistan kills two
British officials say a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan has killed a veteran British war correspondent and a U.S. Marine. Photographer Philip Coburn was seriously wounded by the makeshift bomb, as were four other Marines. Hamer is believed to be the first British journalist to be killed in the Afghan conflict. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has released a statement expressing sympathy for his family, friends and colleagues. Hamer is the second journalist killed in Afghanistan in as many weeks. Canadian journalist Michelle Lang was killed December 30, also by a roadside bomb. Meanwhile, U.S. and Afghan authorities have signed a deal that is expected to transfer responsibility for the U.S.-run detention facility at Bagram Air Base by the end of the year. The site, near Kabul, has been used to hold detainees since the U.S.-led offensive in Afghanistan began in 2001.

Al-Qaida demands hostage exchange; threatens to kill if demands not met
BAMAKO, Mali, Jan. 11 (UPI) -- The North African wing of al-Qaida says it will kill a French hostage unless Mali releases four of its members within 20 days, authorities say. Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb is demanding the release in exchange for freeing Pierre Camatte, CNN reported Monday. "Let France and Mali be forewarned that we give 20 days to fulfill our just demand or the two governments shall be fully responsible for the life of the French hostage," the group said in a statement on an Islamic Web site. AQIM executed a British citizen in June after the British government refused to release Abu Qatada, believed to be Osama bin Laden's top deputy in Europe, CNN said. It joined forces with al-Qaida in 2004 and has spread its reach across North and West Africa, CNN reported. The al-Qaeda group says it seized Frenchman Pierre Camatte in Mali A branch of the al-Qaeda network is demanding the release of four of its members in exchange for a Frenchman it says it kidnapped in Mali last month. The group issued its demand on an Islamist website, according to two US monitoring groups. The statement, issued on Sunday by the north African branch of al-Qaeda, sets an ultimatum of 20 days for the exchange, after which, it says, the French and Malian governments "will be fully responsible for the French hostage's life". Warning to visitors A Malian official has said the demand amounts to "blackmail". A source close to the negotiators told the AFP news agency that the group was also demanding a ransom to free Mr Camatte.

7.0 magnitude earthquake strikes off Haitian coast
The extent of the devastation is still unclear but there are fears thousands of people may have died. Haiti's worst quake in two centuries hit south of the capital Port-au-Prince on Tuesday, wrecking the presidential palace, UN HQ and other buildings. A "large number" of UN personnel were reported missing by the organisation. Many people have spent the night outside amid fears of more aftershocks. The Red Cross says up to three million people have been affected. Describing the earthquake as a "catastrophe", Haiti's envoy to the US said the cost of the damage could run into billions. A number of nations, including the US, UK and Venezuela, are gearing up to send aid. The quake, which struck about 15km (10 miles) south-west of Port-au-Prince, was quickly followed by two strong aftershocks of 5.9 and 5.5 magnitude.

Google may shut down Chinese operations due to censorship and cyber attacks
Those attacks, which Google said took place last week, were directed at some 34 companies or entities, most of them in Silicon Valley, California, according to people with knowledge of Google’s investigation into the matter. The attackers may have succeeded in penetrating elaborate computer security systems and obtaining crucial corporate data and software source codes, though Google said it did not itself suffer losses of that kind. Advertisement Continue reading the main story While the scope of the hacking and the motivations and identities of the hackers remained uncertain, Google’s response amounted to an unambiguous repudiation of its own five-year courtship of the vast China market, which most major multinational companies consider crucial to their growth prospects. It is also likely to enrage the Chinese authorities, who deny that they censor the Internet and are accustomed to having major foreign companies adapt their practices to Chinese norms. The company said it would try to negotiate a new arrangement to provide uncensored results on its search site, google.cn.

Details emerge in Haiti earthquake; thousands feared dead
The United Nations is gearing up for a huge operation to help hundreds of thousands of victims of the powerful earthquake that struck Haiti on Tuesday. U.N. and international agencies are sending disaster experts and essential relief supplies to the stricken Caribbean Island. The earthquake hit a number of areas including the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, where some four million people live. The World Food Program, which has a large staff on the ground, says the level of destruction indicates many of these people have been affected and will require help. The Director of the WFP office in Geneva, Charles Vincent, says the first priority is to save lives. "To rescue people that are buried, that are trapped, etc.…followed very rapidly by a big problem of water, sanitation, epidemic-problems of diseases that might be bred in that kind of situation," Vincent said. Vincent says shelter and food are also critical needs. He says WFP has extensive stocks of food in the country and will distribute supplies to the victims as soon as possible. He says WFP is also airlifting energy biscuits for 30,000 people. The Red Cross says up to three million people have been affected. Describing the earthquake as a "catastrophe", Haiti's envoy to the U.S. said the cost of the damage could run into billions. The Inter-American Development Bank said it will immediately approve a $200,000 grant for emergency asssistance to Haiti which is aimed at providing food, water, medicine and shelter for earthquake victims. PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti—Cries from victims entombed beneath concrete debris pierced the air of seemingly every street in this crowded capital Wednesday, where shocked residents carried the injured and the dead a day after the nation was hit by a quake that some estimate has killed more than 100,000 people.

Countries around the world send aid, help to Haiti
"Search and rescue teams are actively working to save lives," Mr. Obama said. "Our military has secured the airport, and prepared it to receive the heavy equipment and resources that are on the way, and to receive them around the clock, 24 hours a day. An airlift has been set up to deliver high-priority items like water and medicine." The president acknowledges it may take days to move the full U.S. relief effort into Haiti, because roads, airports, ports and communications were damaged in the quake. "More American search and rescue teams are coming, more food, more water, doctors, nurses, paramedics, more of the people, equipment and capabilities that can make the difference between life and death," Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama is also committing the U.S. government to an immediate investment of $100 million for earthquake relief in Haiti. "This will mean more of the life-saving equipment, food, water and medicine that will be needed," Mr. Obama said. "This investment will grow over the coming year, as we embark on the long-term recovery from this unimaginable tragedy." The State Department says it is aware of at least three possible American deaths, and says it is working to locate U.S. Embassy personnel and other U.S. citizens in Haiti.

Haiti relief efforts: in depth
The Haitian Red Cross says the earthquake killed between 45,000 and 50,000 [AFP/UN/Mintusah] Aid agencies are struggling to reach the up to three million of people affected by an earthquake that has devastated Haiti, levelling buildings and burying thousands of people in the rubble. At least 300,000 people were estimated to be homeless in Port-au-Prince on Friday, more than 48 hours after one in 10 homes in the capital collapsed, the United Nations said. Many more people were believed to be sleeping on the streets fearing aftershocks will cause more buildings to fall. 'Logistical challenge'  Rescue and aid efforts have been been hampered by blocked roads, severed communications lines and the difficulties faced by relief agencies that have lost personnel and seen their office destroyed. The capital's port was too badly damaged to handle cargo and supply planes arrived at the airport faster than ground crews could unload them, prompting aviation authorities to restrict non-military flights for fear jets would run out of fuel while waiting to land. Alejandro Lopez-Chicheri, senior spokesman for the World Food Programme for Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean, said that Haiti was "completely on the ground". "The roads, many of them are still to be opened, and on the ones that are open there are still people concentrated on the sides of the roads," he told Al Jazeera from Port-au-Prince. "A lot of people have simply grown tired of waiting for those emergency workers to get to them," Al Jazeera's Sebastian Walker said. In video Al Jazeera's Mike Kirsch reports on Haiti quake survivors who have been left homeless "Thousands of people are streaming out of the city towards the provinces to try to find supplies of food and water, supplies that are running out in the city." David Wimhurst, spokesman for the Brazilian-commanded UN peacekeeping force, said: "Unfortunately, they're slowly getting more angry and impatient. "I fear, we are all aware that the situation is getting more tense as the poorest people who need so much, are waiting for deliveries.

US drone strike kills at least fifteen in Pakistan
US drone attacks are being stepped up along the Afghan-Pakistan border A missile attack by a US drone aircraft has killed at least 15 people in north-west Pakistan, officials say. Four missiles hit the house of a local tribesman in Shaktoi, South Waziristan, near the Afghan border, an official told the BBC. The official said all those killed in the attack were militants. Last week an attack in the same area reportedly targeted Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, but the Taliban say he survived. "Now the death toll is 15. People are still busy removing rubble," a senior security official told Reuters. Another report said the house was being used by Uzbek militants fighting with the Taliban. The US has stepped up drone attacks in north-west Pakistan since a suicide bomber killed seven CIA agents across the border in Afghanistan last month.

Ukraine presidential election headed for runoff
The Orange Revolution did not bring the benefits many Ukrainians hoped for Ukraine's presidential election is set for a second round run-off after partial results showed no candidate would win more than 50% of the vote. With half the votes counted, former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych led current PM Yulia Tymoshenko by 37% to 24%. The two were on opposing sides of the Orange Revolution in 2004-5, but both now favour closer ties with Russia. ANALYSIS Gabriel Gatehouse, BBC News, Kiev Unless the exit polls are very wide of the mark, Viktor Yanukovych will face the Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, in a second round run-off on 7 February. But the pair soon fell out, and she is now portraying herself as the heir of the Orange mantle. Five years ago Viktor Yanukovych was the villain, tainted by allegations of vote-rigging and open support from Moscow. Now, both candidates say they favour closer ties with Russia - after five years of increasingly tense relations under President Yushchenko - and the Kremlin seems happy with either. The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse, in Kiev, says there is much disillusionment among voters over the failure to tackle corruption and links with the EU.

Scott Brown wins special election for Massachusetts's Senate seat in upset victory
Toward the end of her speech, her voice cracked as she quoted Kennedy, saying, “The work begins anew, the hope rises again, and the dream lives on.’’ “I am heartbroken at the result,’’ Coakley told disappointed supporters at the Sheraton Boston. “But I know that we will get up together tomorrow and continue this fight, even with this result tonight.’’ Coakley fared best in liberal suburbs immediately west of Boston, the Berkshires, and in cities such as Lawrence, Springfield, and New Bedford, though not by the large margins required to win statewide. Brown’s strength came from the North and South shores, as well as the suburbs in the Interstate 495 belt, including Holliston, Ashland, and Marlborough, where successful Republicans have historically fared well. He ran up big margins in Plymouth and surrounding communities, as well as in Worcester County. “I go to Washington as the representative of no faction or no special interest, answering only to my conscience and to you the people,’’ Brown said. “I know I have a lot to learn in the Senate, but I know who I am, and I know who I serve. And I drive a truck.’’ And while Brown paid homage to Kennedy, saying “his name would always command respect,’’ he spoke against the health care bill as the crowd chanted “Forty-one! Forty-one!’’ In a race that became the focus of national attention, Brown’s win was widely seen as a vote against the president’s agenda from one of the most reliably Democratic states. In a particularly ironic twist, Brown may well be the 41st vote to prevent the Democratic-led health care plan from moving forward, though Edward M. Kennedy, who held the seat for 47 years, called health care “the cause of my life.’’ “Scott Brown is the next United States senator!’’ Brown’s daughter Ayla shouted from the stage at the Park Plaza Hotel as the euphoric crowd began waving American flags. Coakley called Brown to concede a little more than an hour after polls closed, and the Brown campaign party erupted into jubilant cheers soon after. The stunning, come-from-behind victory caps a dramatic surge in recent days as Brown, a state lawmaker from Wrentham once thought to have little chance of beating a popular attorney general, roared ahead of Coakley to become the first Republican senator elected from Massachusetts since 1972. Republican Scott P. Brown pulled off one of the biggest upsets in Massachusetts political history last night, defeating Democrat Martha Coakley to become the state’s next US senator and potentially derailing President Obama’s hopes for a health care overhaul. President Obama called both candidates last night, congratulating Brown on a well-run campaign’’ and telling Coakley “we can’t win them all.’’ Coakley, after cruising to an easy victory in the primary, began the general election race with seemingly every edge, from name recognition and fund-raising ability to a lopsided advantage in voter registration and the backing of the state’s Democratic establishment.

UK woman convicted of 'mercy' murder of son
Frances Inglis, 57, was given a life sentence for killing her 22-year-old son Tom after he sustained severe head injuries when he fell out of a moving ambulance. Tom's brother, Alex, speaking outside court, praised his mother for her "loving and courageous act" and called for a review of the law for people who kill as an "act of mercy". He said: "How can it be legal to withhold food and water, which means a slow and painful death, yet illegal to end all suffering in a quick, calm and loving way? "What this case and a number of others have exposed is a need for a complete rethink of existing laws in regard to people that have been, and will be, in the same position as Tom." "Why is my mum the only person who has been called to answer for her actions which were done out of love for her son?" Inglis, who will serve at least nine years of her life sentence less the 423 days she has spent in custody, said she killed her son to end his "living hell" and that she had "no choice". The court heard how the mother gave her son a heroin overdose two months after he fell out of the moving ambulance in which he was being treated following a pub fight. Nurses resuscitated him and she was charged with attempted murder, but bailed on the condition she did not contact her son. A year later, she entered his nursing home posing as his aunt, and barricaded herself in his room using an oxygen cylinder, a wheelchair and superglue to seal the door shut. When staff broke down the door half an hour later, she urged them not to try to resuscitate him. Judge Brian Barker, the Common Serjeant of London, told the jury that they "could not have had a more difficult case", but asked them to put emotion aside and told them no one had the "unfettered right" to take the law into their own hands.

Bomb explosions kill several people in central Baghdad
The Ishtar Sheraton hotel is seen behind a wave of dust after a bomb attack in central Baghdad January 25, 2010. REUTERS/Saad Shalash BAGHDAD Three large car bombs rocked well-known Baghdad hotels on Monday, killing at least 36 people and ending a 1-1/2-month lull in coordinated assaults on the Iraqi capital as the country heads into a March election. Police said at least 71 people were wounded in the separate suicide car bombings, which went off within minutes of one another. Health Ministry data showed a lower figure for the death toll. A giant mushroom cloud of debris rose from the blast site as ambulances and fire trucks rushed to the scene. The blast took place across from a park frequented by families and picnickers. The building has not been a regular hotel for years and largely houses company offices and some media organizations, but some adventurous international tour groups began using it last year. Zina Tareq, an Iraqi journalist who was in her office at the time of the blast, said she dived under a desk with the five-year-old daughter of a colleague.

Unreported tainted milk incident publicised in China
BEIJING Authorities in southwestern China have ordered three batches of milk products off shelves because they contain a chemical that killed at least six children in 2008, causing global concern over the made-in-China brand. The health department in Guizhou province stopped the sales of dairy products made by three Chinese companies, the state-run China Daily newspaper said. The products were found to contain melamine, which can cause kidney stones and is meant for making plastics, fertilizers and even concrete. Its high nitrogen content allows protein levels to appear higher when it is added to milk or animal feed. China executed two people in November for their role in a huge melamine-tainted milk scandal that killed at least six children and sullied the made-in-China brand. Nearly 300,000 children fell ill in that scandal in 2008 after drinking milk intentionally laced with melamine, sold mainly in that case by the now bankrupt Sanlu Group. SHANGHAI—Chinese state-run media said the industrial chemical melamine was found again in milk products early last year, the latest report to suggest the government's crackdown on potentially dangerous practices in the dairy industry after a major 2008 food-safety scandal didn't fully solve the problem. Milk products made by three companies, Shandong Zibo Lusaier Dairy Co., Liaoning Tieling Wuzhou Food Co. and Laoting Kaida Refrigeration Plant, were found to have included excessive melamine and removed from store shelves... Melamine-tainted milk products have been found on sale in China, more than a year after thousands of children became ill in a huge safety scandal. Products made by three different firms were found to contain melamine and have now been removed from supermarkets in Guizhou province, officials say. If ingested in sufficient quantities, melamine can cause kidney failure and kidney stones.

UK bans export of fraudulent bomb detector; arrests director of manufacturer
The ADE-651 is still in use at checkpoints in Baghdad Some Iraqi officials are insisting that a controversial bomb detection device works, despite a BBC inquiry in which experts said the item was useless. Britain has banned exports of the ADE-651 and the director of the company selling them was arrested and bailed. Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani, whose department bought $85m of the devices, said the ADE-651 had detected 16,000 bombs, including 700 car bombs. "The thing is, the instrument is being operated by a user," he said. "Not all those who use the instrument are fully trained, the user needs to be alert and adept at using it." There are allegations that failure of the ADE-651 may have been a factor allowing suicide truck bombs to pass through checkpoints on three occasions last year, leading to hundreds of deaths. Iraqi investigations Jim McCormick, director of Somerset-based ATSC, which sold the device, says it uses special electronic cards slotted into it to detect explosives. We conducted several tests on them, and found them successful General Jihad al-Jabiri Interior ministry But a BBC Newsnight investigation reported that a computer laboratory said the card it examined contained only a tag used by shops to prevent theft. One has been ordered by Prime Minister Nouri Maliki, whose office has been told not to comment until the results are known. 'Rival companies' But the interior ministry is still standing by the device. Jawad al-Bolani said on Friday: "There are a lot of companies working on the development of these sort of instruments and Iraq is now considered a market area for companies producing such devices.

Votes in Sri Lankan presidential elections counted
There was controversy after Gen Fonseka was unable to vote Votes are being counted in Sri Lanka's first presidential election since Tamil Tiger rebels were defeated after more than 25 years of civil war. Election day passed largely peacefully despite several minor bomb blasts. The former allies fell out after the war ended last year. In the hours after the polls closed, soldiers established a heavy presence outside the hotel in central Colombo where Gen Fonseka is staying. The BBC's Charles Haviland, in the capital, says that about 50 armed troops are stationed outside the Cinnamon Lakeside hotel, searching every vehicle that enters. Gen Fonseka says he fears the troops plan to arrest him if he wins the election. A military spokesman has denied these claims. BBC correspondents say with the ethnic Sinhalese vote split between the two men, Tamil and Muslim minorities could play a decisive part in the outcome. Under Sri Lanka's electoral rules, if no candidate wins 50% of ballots cast in the first count, then voters' second - or even third - preferences are tallied to determine the winner. 'Better tomorrow' After a violent and acrimonious campaign, many had feared the worst on election day.

Obama's first State of the Union speech focuses on economy, jobs
U.S. President Barack Obama is urging Americans to overcome a deficit of trust in government and work together to solve a damaged economy and other problems. The economy was high on the president's list of priorities in his annual State of the Union address Wednesday night. Mr. Obama acknowledged that many Americans are frustrated and angry, doubting whether he can deliver the change he promised in his 2008 campaign. But he said change is not easy, and he will continue to pursue it. "We do not quit. Let us seize this moment-to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more," he said. In his hour-long speech before both houses of Congress, the president several times confronted the public anger that has caused his approval ratings to slide. We face a deficit of trust-deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years," he said. Mr. Obama called for a number of initiatives to address the problem and urged the Senate to join the House of Representatives in passing a second jobs bill.

Historian Howard Zinn dies at age 87
BOSTON Historian and activist Howard Zinn, whose 1980 book "A People's History of the United States" was a rallying cry for the American left in a conservative era, has died aged 87. Family members said Zinn, who for decades was a fixture in the U.S. civil rights and anti-war movements and lived in Auburndale, Massachusetts, died of a heart attack on Wednesday while traveling in California. He was a professor emeritus in the political science department at Boston University and taught there from 1964 to 1988. "He had a deep sense of fairness and justice for the underdog. But he always kept his sense of humor. Rivers and Zinn were among a group of faculty members who in 1979 defended the right of the school's clerical workers to strike and were threatened with dismissal after refusing to cross a picket line. "A People's History of the United States" chronicled the nation's development through voices of women, minorities and the working class, telling the U.S. story as series of episodes where the state and big business colluded to crush socialism. American leftists celebrated the work at a time when conservatism as embodied by U.S. President Ronald Reagan was ascendant. Zinn was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1922 into a Jewish immigrant family. During World War Two he enlisted in the U.S. Army and flew in planes that bombed targets in Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. He wrote in the magazine "The Progressive" in 2006 that his military service had informed his anti-war views. "Once we decided, at the start, that our side was the good side and the other side was evil ... we did not have to think any more.

Two Iranians hanged over mosque bombing
Nasrin Sotoudeh, a lawyer for Rahmanipour, denied he had played any role in the unrest The executions were the first carried out for election-related incidents. 'Show trial' Iranian authorities arrested around 4,000 protesters including journalists and reformist politicians in a massive crackdown in the weeks after the disputed election. The two were among 11 people sentenced to death on similar charges in the wake of post-election protests. "He was arrested in Farvardin [the Iranian month covering March-April] before the [presidential] election and charged with co-operation with the [monarchist] Kingdom Assembly," Sotoudeh told AFP. She also said she was prevented from representing Rahmanipour at his "show trial" in July and that many of the charges were brought against him when he was a minor. "He confessed because of threats against his family," she said, adding that she was shocked at the news of the executions since she and her client's family had still been waiting for word from the appeals court. Crackdown Baqer Moin, an Iranian author and journalist, said the execution was a "political decision", likely intended to "set an example and to frighten some of the people who may shout a slogans that are not of the liking of the authorities". "We don't really know which group they belong to, one of them is a monarchist and the other one is the Mujahideen group, obviously the Mujahideen group is not very popular but little is known about the monarchist group," he told Al Jazeera. "Their lawyers have said that these people were arrested much before the elections, I suppose that they have been used as an example specifically as we are approaching the anniversary of the revolution." He said: "It is an attempt to make sure that the radicals within the opposition movements are not going to take the lead in the anniversary of the revolution." Denying fraud, Tehran portrayed the protests as a foreign-backed bid to undermine Iran's Islamic system of government.

Tony Blair tells Iraq Inquiry he would invade again
Tony Blair has said the Iraq war made the world a safer place and he has "no regrets" about removing Saddam Hussein. In a robust defence of his decision to back war, Mr Blair said Saddam was a "monster and I believe he threatened not just the region but the world." The former prime minister was barracked by a member of the public as he made his closing statement at the end of a six-hour grilling at the Iraq inquiry. He said Iraqis were now better off and he would take the same decisions again. 'Safer place' Family members of service personnel killed in Iraq - and members of the public who got their seats after a public ballot - had been sitting behind Mr Blair in the public gallery as he was questioned about the build-up and aftermath of the Iraq war. KEY POINTS 9/11 changed attitude to Iraq and meant tougher line was needed Denied "covert" deal at Crawford summit with President Bush in April 2002 over invasion Stood by "beyond doubt" claim over Iraq's chemical weapons Basis for war was Iraqi breach of UN disarmament agreements not regime change Should have corrected media reporting of 45-minute WMD claim Second UN resolution preferable but not legally necessary US offered "way out" option if UK could not provide troops Key issues: Blair's response Analysis: Questions remain Send us your comments When Mr Blair left he was booed by some members of the public and two women shouted at him "you are a liar" and "you are a murderer". Committee chairman Sir John Chilcot asked Mr Blair at the end of the session if he had any regrets about the war, but Mr Blair said that although he was "sorry" it had been "divisive" he believed it had been right to remove Saddam. "It was better to deal with this threat, to remove him from office and I do genuinely believe the world is a safer place as a result." He told the inquiry if Saddam had not been removed "today we would have a situation where Iraq was competing with Iran" both in terms of nuclear capability and "in respect of support of terrorist groups". "The decision I took - and frankly would take again - was if there was any possibility that he could develop weapons of mass destruction we should stop him." 'Covert deal' Sometimes it is important not to ask the "March 2003 question" but the "2010 question", said Mr Blair, arguing that if Saddam had been left in power the UK and its allies would have "lost our nerve" to act. Anti-war protesters were out in force near the Chilcot inquiry building He also stressed the importance of taking a "tough line" with Iran, accusing the country of colluding with al-Qeada to destabilise Iraq in the aftermath of the invasion, rejecting claims the UK had taken a "cavalier" attitude to post-war planning. Earlier witnesses to the inquiry have suggested he told Mr Bush at their April 2002 meeting at the ranch in Crawford, Texas, that the UK would join the Americans in a war with Iraq.

Ben Bernanke confirmed as Federal Reserve chairman for second term
WASHINGTON  The Senate gave Ben S. Bernanke a second four-year term as the head of the Federal Reserve on Thursday after critics excoriated the central bank’s conduct in the years leading up to the financial crisis. The 70-to-30 vote was the weakest endorsement ever extended to a chairman in the Fed’s 96-year history. The confirmation was a victory for President Obama, who had called Mr. Bernanke an architect of the recovery, but also signaled the extent to which the Fed, once little known to the public, has become the object of outrage over high unemployment and bank bailouts. In several hours of debate, senators said that the Fed had abetted, then ignored, the housing and credit bubbles and allowed banks to keep dangerously low capital reserves and to make reckless lending decisions that ruined consumers. Some even blamed Mr. Bernanke for the falling dollar and questioned his commitment to free enterprise. They reiterated that the Fed had made mistakes but said that Mr. Bernanke had helped save the economy from a far worse recession. After a week in which top White House officials and Mr. Bernanke met with Democratic leaders in the Senate to secure support, the Senate first voted 77 to 23 to end debate, with more than the 60 votes needed to overcome the threat of a filibuster. On a second vote, to confirm, the 30 dissents came from 18 Republicans, 11 Democrats and one independent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont. “As the nation continues to face the consequences of the worst recession in a generation, Ben Bernanke has provided wisdom and steady leadership in the midst of the financial and economic crisis,” he said. While an arm-twisting campaign by the administration limited the opposition, the outcry against the Fed will most likely continue rippling through economic policy generally, and Mr. Bernanke’s leadership of the Fed in particular. The Obama administration has proposed consolidating risk regulation under the Fed, while some in Congress want to strip away its oversight authority. “The institutional prestige of the Fed, even apart from this vote, had taken a hit, and it started back around the disaster of September 2008,” said Stephen H. Axilrod, who worked at the Fed for 34 years and wrote a history of its monetary policies.

US nationals arrested for alleged abduction of Haitian children
This weekend's arrest of 10 members of an Idaho-based Baptist charity for trying to take 33 Haitian children across the border with the Dominican Republic without proper paperwork has become an international incident. Clint Henry, head pastor at Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho, paused for a moment while taking questions from the media on Sunday. When does adoption become child trafficking? That question seems to be the last thing that Haiti's notoriously ill-equipped, underfunded, and understaffed government needs to be tackling in the wake of the Jan. 12 earthquake that leveled the capital, Port-au-Prince. But Saturday's arrest of 10 members of an Idaho-based Baptist charity for trying to take 33 Haitian children across the border with the Dominican Republic without proper paperwork has become an international incident. And it now threatens to be a serious distraction from the daunting task of providing food, shelter, and security for the more than 1 million left homeless by the quake. The members of the New Life Children's Refuge said that they were only trying to provide a better life for the children and denied that the group had done anything wrong. But the problem with following their highest sense of right without proper permission from the authorities is that it may technically be child trafficking. And in a weak country where that illicit trade has exploded in recent years, the authorities are taking this quite seriously. Prime Minister Max Bellerive denounced the group’s “illegal trafficking of children.” "This is an abduction, not an adoption," said Social Affairs Minister Yves Christallin, explaining that children need authorization from the ministry to leave the country. Apparently, the New Life members had no government-issued paperwork of any kind as they attempted to take the children across the border. "You can't just go and take a child out of a country – no matter what country you are in," said Kent Page, a spokesman for UNICEF in Haiti. You can't just pick up a child and walk out of a country with a child, no matter what your best intentions are."

Obama announces US$3.8 trillion 2011 budget plan for US
US President Barack Obama has announced a $3.8tn (£2.4tn) budget plan for 2011, which includes increased spending for job creation, but cuts in other areas. He also forecast the US deficit would rise to a record $1.56tn this year. He scrapped plans to send astronauts back to the Moon and will seek to save $250bn by capping a range of domestic spending programmes for three years. Congress must approve the budget for the financial year starting on 1 October for it to take effect. Mr Obama blamed the huge deficit on the decisions of President George W Bush, previous Congresses and his administration's moves to prevent an economic collapse. ANALYSIS Kevin Connolly, BBC News, Washington Barack Obama, buffeted by recent election defeats for his Democratic Party, has a keen political sense of the image he wants to portray on the economy - that of a president forced by circumstance into enlarging America's already huge budget deficit in the short-term while promising in the medium-term to reduce it. So his $3.8tn budget includes more money for education and scientific research and more for defence programmes. But it also looks forward to eliminating waste and freezing many other domestic programmes. His electoral future may well depend on his ability to bring the deficit under control. He said that in normal circumstances he would have worked to cut the deficit immediately, but expensive steps were need to help the economy. Mr Obama urged lawmakers to follow his lead on reducing "waste in programmes I care about" and avoid "grandstanding". He added: "We cannot continue to spend as if deficits do not matter."

NTSB says pilot error caused crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407
Mistakes by pilots, not bad weather, caused the crash of a turboprop plane near Buffalo last year that killed 50 people, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday in its final hearing on the crash. Among the errors: The plane's captain repeatedly yanked back on the control wheel when he should have pushed forward; the first officer miscalculated air speed and both were so distracted by a personal conversation that they were caught off guard in the minutes before the accident. Deborah Hersman, chairman of the safety board, said the investigation revealed a "picture of complacency and confusion that resulted in catastrophe." The safety board, the principal investigator of air accidents, adopted 46 recommendations related to the crash, in which a Colgan Air turboprop flying as Continental Connection Flight 3407 crashed during its approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The Feb. 12 crash killed all 49 people on board and one man in a house, making it the deadliest U.S. transportation accident in seven years. At the hearing, agency investigators portrayed the accident as almost completely avoidable. Investigators found that the plane -- a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 -- had no mechanical problems. Agency investigators also ruled out weather conditions, finding that the amount of ice accumulation on the plane did not alter its flight performance. Additionally, the board announced that it planned to hold a public symposium on code-sharing agreements between airlines. Major carriers say that under the code-sharing system, they are able to maintain profitable service to small cities. Hersman said the board would examine government oversight and financial aspects of such relationships. Half of all scheduled flights in the United States are operated by regional airlines, which have a poor safety record when compared with major carriers.

Pakistan arrests 35 people suspected in US soldiers' death
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Pakistani officials said Thursday that they have arrested 35 suspects as part of their investigation into a bombing that killed three American soldiers and four Pakistanis on Wednesday in northwest Pakistan. “They are all locals,” said the duty officer at the police station in the town of Balambat, where the bombing occurred, in the Lower Dir District. The police made 30 arrests, and 5 more were made by members of the paramilitary Frontier Corps, according to a senior official in the North-West Frontier Province. “We are questioning them in an effort to trace those who orchestrated the suicide attack,” a police official, Naeem Khan, told The Associated Press. ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani police have arrested 30 suspects in connection with a bombing that killed three American soldiers, three children and a Pakistani paramilitary soldier outside a girls' school, an officer said. Naeem Khan, duty officer in the police station in the town of Timergara in the northwest where the attack took place, said police suspect the Wednesday bombing was a suicide attack. "We have recovered the engine of the car we suspect was used in the bombing," Khan told Reuters. Forty-five people were wounded in the blast near the Swat Valley, where the government mounted a crackdown nearly a year ago it said had largely cleared out Taliban militants. We have sent these limbs for DNA tests," Khan said. Pakistan's Taliban have bombed markets, schools and military and police facilities despite major government security offensives that have destroyed some of their bases and U.S. drone aircraft strikes that have killed their leaders. Pakistani officials say they have arrested 35 people in connection with the suicide car bombing Tuesday that killed three American military trainers and four Pakistanis in northwest Pakistan.

Landmark coalition offensive launched in Afghanistan
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Afghan officials say Islamic State militants have attacked the Taliban in the northern Jawzjan province, igniting heavy clashes in which dozens of fighters were killed. Mohammad Reza Ghafori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said Wednesday that the fighting, which began the day before, has killed 76 Taliban fighters and 15 from the IS affiliate. He says the IS militants seized two districts from the Taliban. The Taliban and IS are both fighting to overthrow Afghanistan's U.S.-backed government and impose a harsh version of Islamic rule, but they are bitterly split over leadership and tactics. The IS affiliate is largely made up of disgruntled former Taliban fighters. Abdul Hafiz Khashyee, a police official, says the fighting took place in a remote area and there were no reports of civilian casualties. HELMAND PROVINCE, Afghanistan –NATO troops in Afghanistan launched their biggest offensive of the war early Saturday, attacking what they call the last Taliban stronghold in a war-scarred southern province. ET Friday) two firefights had erupted between the Taliban and U.S. Marines in Marjah. The offensive turned a main bazaar near the city center into a ghost town after residents were warned to leave the area. NATO forces said they are following a directive not to shoot at civilians, some of whom are still on the streets. "Insurgents who do not accept the government's offer to reintegrate and join the political process will be met with overwhelming force," the International Security Assistance Force Joint Command said in a statement.

Joint US-Pakistan operation captures top Taliban commander
U.S. officials say American and Pakistani intelligence forces together captured the Afghan Taliban's top military commander several days ago in Pakistan. Officials say the commander, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, is the most significant Taliban figure detained since the war in Afghanistan started eight years ago. The New York Times first reported news of the arrest late Monday. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is the Afghan Taliban's most influential member after the group's spiritual leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. Officials say Baradar is in Pakistani custody, with American and Pakistani authorities taking part in interrogations. Taliban representatives denied Baradar had been arrested, but they did not provide any evidence to support their claim. But he said that since the U.S.-led coalition invaded the Taliban stronghold of Marjah in southern Afghanistan several days ago, Pakistan has arrested suspected militants who have fled across the border. "There are a number of arrests of people who were running away from Afghanistan and coming to Pakistan. He also said that it is true the United States and Pakistan share intelligence information. But he stressed that Pakistan is a sovereign nation and does not allow foreign forces to take part in anti-militancy raids within its borders.

Plane crashes into office block in Austin, Texas
(CNN) -- The remains of two people have been found in an Austin, Texas, building where a man crashed a small plane, authorities said. The identities of the two dead people have not been confirmed, the Austin Fire Department said in a statement. Two other people who were injured in the incident were taken to a hospital, and 11 others were treated for minor injuries, Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said. Authorities said Andrew Joseph Stack III, 53, an Austin resident with an apparent grudge against the Internal Revenue Service, set his house on fire Thursday and then crashed a Piper Cherokee PA-28 into the building, which houses an IRS office with nearly 200 employees, federal officials said. "This appears to be an intentional act by a sole individual," Acevedo said at a news conference. A fire created by the crash had been put out, save for some small areas, officials said.

Niger coup ousts president
(CNN) -- Niger's constitution has been suspended, a Niger military official announced Thursday night on the nation's three television channels. The order, read by Col. Goukoye Abdul Karimou, was attributed to the Superior Council for the Restoration of Democracy, which also suspended all institutions and called on the nation for calm and on the international community for support, said Ousman Tudou, a journalist for Radio Afini. Tudou said President Mamadou Tandja and his ministers were being held in a military camp. No curfew had been ordered and people were in the streets at 11 p.m., around the time of the announcement, he said. Dana Palade, a spokeswoman for the nongovernmental organization World Vision, told CNN from the capital city of Niamey that the official made the announcement on Doumial Tele Sahel and RTT. Palade said she heard gunfire in the streets. The people are calm," she said, adding the atmosphere was "not what you'd expect in a capital city where you have a coup d'état." Earlier Thursday, the Niger Embassy in London, England, reported an "ongoing attempted coup d'etat" was taking place in Niger. "Details remain sparse, but sporadic gunshots have continued to be heard in and around the presidential palace for some time," said a statement from the embassy. "Reports reaching us suggest that both the president and the cabinet ministers who were with him at the time are safe and well." Resident and activist Laoual Sayabou told CNN the military surrounded the palace, where a ministerial meeting was taking place, about 1 p.m.

Madeira storm kills at least 42
Advertisement Rescue workers are searching mud-filled streets and houses on the Portuguese island of Madeira after flash floods left at least 42 people dead. More than 120 others were injured and an unknown number are missing, raising fears that the death toll could rise. Heavy rains brought tonnes of mud and stones down the slopes of the island, flooding the streets of the regional capital, Funchal, and other towns. In pictures: Flood aftermath Briton dies in Madeira floods Your pictures The weather improved on Sunday following Saturday's rains, making it easier for rescue workers. But regional social services spokesman Francisco Ramos said there were "great difficulties" in communications and that the death toll "will likely increase, given the circumstances of this flood". Three remote areas in the south of the island have been cut off. Officials fear more bodies may be found there. The Portuguese cabinet is due to discuss the crisis in an extraordinary meeting on Monday, and expected to announce three days of national mourning. Prime Minister Jose Socrates, who is on the island, said he was "profoundly shocked" by the severity of the floods, and promised that his government would help Madeira recover as quickly as possible.

Dutch government collapses over Afghanistan troops
Dutch forces have been in Uruzgan since 2006 The Dutch government has collapsed over disagreements within the governing coalition on extending troop deployments in Afghanistan. He offered his government's resignation to Queen Beatrix in a telephone call. The premier had been considering a Nato request for Dutch forces to stay in Afghanistan beyond August 2010. But Labour, the second-largest coalition party, has opposed the move. Asadullah Hamdam, the governor of the Afghan province of Uruzgan, where the Dutch mission is based, told the BBC that peace and reconstruction efforts would suffer a setback if the Dutch troops left. "They help our security forces a great deal in security matters here," said Mr Hamdam told the BBC. "In many districts they work together with the Afghan National Army, and they help in developmental projects. "They are constructing bridges, schools, roads and assisting in many other educational projects." Alliance spokesman James Appathurai said whatever happened, the Afghan people should know that Nato would "continue to provide support to them as long as necessary".

General Petraeus: Fight for Afghan town Marja is 'just the initial operation'
The U.S. general who oversees the war in Afghanistan says the fight for the southern town of Marjah is just the first operation in a long campaign. Petraeus says the battle of Marjah is just the beginning. "This is just the initial operation of what will be a 12- to 18-month campaign, as General McChrystal and his team have mapped it out," he said. During an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Petraeus said the enemy is formidable. He did not predict how long the operation in Marjah - a traditional Taliban stronghold - would continue. He said only that the fighting is tough. "When we go on the offensive, when we take away sanctuaries and safe havens from the Taliban and the other extremist elements that we and our Afghan and coalition partners are fighting in that country, they are going to fight back. He noted the difficulties encountered in Iraq when former President George W. Bush sent in additional troops in what was called a "surge." Look, I have repeatedly said these types of efforts are hard and they are hard all the time.

Toyota accused of misleading public over recalls
Toyota: Saved $100 million dodging recall Internal Toyota documents provided to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee show the carmaker saved $100 million by negotiating an 'equipment' recall' rather than a vehicle recall. NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- In an internal presentation, Toyota staffers boasted of the company saving $100 million by negotiating a limited recall for Toyota Camry and Lexus ES cars over a problem that could cause unintended acceleration. In an internal Toyota (TM) document used as part of a company presentation on its government relations, dated July 6, 2009, the phrase "Negotiated 'equipment' recall on Camry/ES re: [sudden acceleration], saved $100 million+ with no defect found" is among a bullet-pointed list of "wins." An "equipment" recall is a more limited type of recall, often to repair an accessory or non-essential part of the vehicle. The reference was apparently to a September 2007 recall to secure floor mats that could trap the cars' gas pedals. In August 2009, the month following the presentation in which the executive boasted of saving $100 million over a full recall, a family of four was killed in a Lexus with its gas pedal stuck under a floor mat. In November 2009, Toyota had full recall to reconfigure the gas pedals of numerous Toyota models to prevent such incidents. Among other "wins" listed were "Avoided investigation on Tacoma rust" and helping win delays in various new federal safety regulations. Toyota documents, presented in the form of a corporate slide show, also presented an unfavorable view of the Obama administration. The Toyota documents also said that NHTSA's "new, more aggressive management includes more attorneys," but "less understanding of engineering issues." Also, the documents said that equipment manufacturers face "a more challenging regulatory and enforcement environment."

Female lawyers to be granted court access in Saudi Arabia
Judicial reforms  At the moment, female lawyers in the kingdom can only work behind the scenes in government and court offices, where they do not come into contact with men. All judges in the kingdom are male religious clerics. As part of ongoing judicial reforms, the Saudi government is developing a network of specialised courts, including "personal status" or family courts, where the women lawyers would be allowed to practice. Women in Saudi Arabia are nearly totally segregated from men in public life. Women have often protested about their treatment Saudi Arabia is planning to bring in a new law to allow women lawyers to argue cases in court for the first time. At the moment, they can only work behind the scenes in government and court offices. "In accordance with the new law, women will be able to complete their preliminary procedures with notaries by just presenting their IDs," said Ministry of Justice official Osama al-Mirdas, according to Arab News. Under a system of male guardianship, Saudi Arabian women are required to be kept separate from men they are not related to. All are veiled to a greater or lesser degree in public, they are not allowed to drive, and women under 45 must receive permission from a male when they travel.

At least fifteen dead after stampede at Mali mosque
Thousands of pilgrims come to Timbuktu for the prophet's birthday and an official said the accident might have been caused by obstacles resulting from renovation work on the 14th-century mosque made largely from mud. "The mosque is being renovated, financed by the Aga Khan, and the work is carried out by South African specialists," an official at Timbuktu town hall told AFP, asking not to be named. "Because of these renovations, the passage on the north side of the mosque is closed off. On that side, to get through, the faithful found an improvised alleyway. "But the alley couldn't take the number of people using it. He gives us life, he takes it away," said the mosque's imam, who gave his name as Asseyuti. It remains synonymous in Europe with the idea of an exotic faraway land, but the town's historic buildings require constant renovation.

Pacific Rim braces for tsunami following major Chilean earthquake
NZ issues tsunami alert after Chile quake Updated New Zealand has issued a tsunami alert after a huge 8.8 magnitude quake hit off the coast of Chile, sparking a Pacific-wide warning that huge waves may be on the move. But the waves, which would not reach New Zealand until about 15 hours after the Chilean earthquake struck, were not expected to pack destructive force, the government said. "The magnitude of the Chile quake has been confirmed as 8.8. A local tsunami has been confirmed with the highest recorded wave measuring 2.2 meters (7.21 feet)," New Zealand's Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management said. "Current assessment is for a non-destructive tsunami for New Zealand with wave heights at the shore of between 0.2 and one metre (three feet). "The first wave may arrive later and may not be the largest. Waves may continue for several hours," it said, warning New Zealanders to stay off beaches and out of the sea. The warning in New Zealand and a similar one in Australia came after the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii earlier warned of a Pacific-wide tsunami threat following the huge temblor off Chile. "Sea-level readings confirm that a tsunami has been generated which could cause widespread damage," the centre said. Some 186 people died in Samoa, neighbouring American Samoa and Tonga in September last year after an 8.0 quake spawned a deadly tsunami that battered coastal villages in the island nation.

Major storms batter Europe
Paris, France (CNN) -- A winter storm named "Xynthia" battered the western coast of Europe Sunday, its high winds downing trees and power lines and leaving as many as 55 people dead, authorities said. Hardest hit was France, where at least 45 people were killed, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon announced. The extra-tropical cyclone whipped the country's coastal regions and moved inland, bringing sometimes heavy flooding with it. Are you affected by the storm? "It's a national catastrophe," Fillon said in a brief news conference following an emergency meeting on the situation. "Many people drowned, surprised by the rapid rise of the water. "Now the priority is to bring all the people left homeless and still threatened by the rising waters to safety," the prime minister explained. French President Nicolas Sarkozy will visit the department of Charente-Maritime Monday, Fillon said. Charente-Maritime and Vendee, on the French coast west of Paris, had severe flooding when the strong winds whipped up the water at high tide. We got up to look and then we saw 80 cm (about 31 inches) of water in the garage," a resident of Aiguillon-Sur-Mer, in the department of Vendee, told CNN affiliate BFM-TV.

Apple sues Taiwanese mobile phone maker HTC
SAN FRANCISCO — Apple has relied on slick applications, and even slicker advertisements, to promote the iPhone and maintain its advantage over rivals like Google in the battle to rule the next generation of smartphones. But the fight may come down to something more provincial: who has the best lawyers. On Tuesday, Apple sued HTC, the Taiwanese company that is the largest maker of smartphones running Google’s Android operating system, including the Nexus One, designed and sold by Google. In the lawsuit, filed with the office of the United States International Trade Commission and the United States District Court in Delaware, Apple said that HTC phones running Android violated 20 of its patents, including those relating to the iPhone’s ability to recognize the touch of multiple fingers on its screen at once. Since last fall, Google has been gradually adding multitouch capabilities to phones running Android through software updates. Though the lawsuit singles out HTC, many patent lawyers and analysts say they believe Apple’s target is Google and the Android operating system, which the company gives away to cellphone manufacturers. We’ve decided to do something about it,” said Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, in a statement. “We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours.” Apple and Google, once close allies, are now fighting for control of the market for smartphones, seen as the most important computing platform of the next decade. The battle has become emotional since last year, when HTC, Motorola and other phone makers began selling Android-based phones that offered a credible alternative to the iPhone. The lawsuit “is the opening shot in a war,” said Kevin Rivette, a patent lawyer and former vice president for intellectual property strategy at I.B.M. They want to break the Android tsunami.” In a statement, HTC said that it “values patent rights and their enforcement but is also committed to defending its own technology innovations.” The company said it had not yet had an opportunity to review Apple’s claims.

A man is then heard telling the plane: "Here's what you get, guys, when the kids are out of school." If the pilot was annoyed, he didn't let on. On the tape he chuckled and said, "Wish I could bring my kid to work." The same pilot later told the child he did an "awesome job". The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) investigation turned up a second incident on Feb 17, involving a younger girl. The FAA said that the controller and his supervisor on the day had been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation. "This behaviour is not acceptable and does not demonstrate the kind of professionalism expected from all FAA employees," it said in a statement.

Two police officers injured in Pentagon shooting incident
The gunman who charged into one of the Pentagon's main entrances and opened fire has died from gunshot wounds to the head and authorities are looking into his recent rants against the government as a potential motive. John Patrick Bedell, 36, died at the hospital Thursday night after Pentagon police returned fire. Police told ABC News that the two police officers wounded in the shooting have been released from the hospital after suffering minor injuries. Play The attack seems to be another suicide mission aimed at the government. While police have said they are not certain of a motive, they are investigating Internet postings in which Bedell wrote and recorded audio expressing his anger toward the government. "The moral values of individuals and communities are increasingly attacked by a political system where deceit is routine and accepted and the only standard is power," he said in the online video. The shooting came just weeks after Joe Stack flew his plane into the IRS office in Austin, Texas, after leaving a lengthy manifesto in which he told the IRS to "take my pound of flesh and sleep well." "It came at the time of night when thousands of Pentagon employees were trying to leave the building at one of the Pentagon's main entrances," ABC News correspondent Martha Raddatz told "Good Morning America's" George Stephanopoulos. As a building-wide announcement notified workers that the Metro had been locked down, employees began trying to make their way to various exits only to find each one blocked. That's when I started to see a backlog of people milling the length of the corridor to the exit," Martinez said.

Non-profit ACORN plans to shut down
The community organizing group Acorn announced Monday that it would close all its remaining state affiliates and field offices by April 1. The organization is “developing a plan to resolve all outstanding debts, obligations and other issues,” said a statement released by the group. Acorn has been battered by criticism from the right and has lost federal money and private donations since a video sting was publicized last fall. Acorn employees were shown in the videos advising two young conservative activists — posing as a pimp and a prostitute — how to conceal their criminal activities. In reaction to the videos, the Census Bureau ended its partnership with the organization for this year’s census, the Internal Revenue Service dropped the group from its Voluntary Income Tax Assistance program, and Congress voted to cut off all grants to the organization. (CNN) -- The community organizing group ACORN announced Monday it is closing its operations amid falling revenues. The announcement came a day after the board of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now met and approved the steps required "to responsibly manage the process of bringing its operations to a close over the coming months," an ACORN statement read. The group's remaining state affiliates and field offices will close by April 1, and a plan will be developed to pay its debts, the statement said. "ACORN's members have a great deal to be proud of -- from promoting homeownership to helping rebuild New Orleans, from raising wages to winning safer streets, from training community leaders to promoting voter participation -- ACORN members have worked hard to create stronger communities, a more inclusive democracy and a more just nation," it said. The 40-year-old liberal group was crippled by scandal six months ago when a pair of conservative activists posing as a pimp and a prostitute secretly videotaped two ACORN employees appearing to give them advice about setting up a prostitution ring and evading the IRS. In a news release issued Saturday, ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis said the group had faced "a series of well-orchestrated, relentless, well-funded, right-wing attacks that are unprecedented since the McCarthy era.

UK's ITV cancels police drama "The Bill" after 27 years
Long-running show The Bill to be axed by ITV in autumn after revamp and switch to new 9pm slot fail to revive ratings The Bill, one of the UK's longest-running TV dramas, is to be dropped by ITV in the autumn after 27 years, MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal. ITV has taken the decision to axe the police drama after last year's revamp and switch to a new 9pm slot failed to halt a long-term ratings decline. The Bill was moved last year from being aired twice a week at 8pm on ITV1 to a single slot on Thursdays at 9pm. The show's storylines were tweaked to take account of the new post-watershed slot. However, ratings for the show have failed to pick up. In 2002 the show averaged more that 7 million viewers, while more recently audiences been about 3.5 million. Talkback Thames, the independent producer which makes the show, said that it would now enter a consultation process with staff that work on The Bill and was expecting a "significant number of redundancies". The broadcaster said that the decision to drop the series was made as part of a creative rethink of its drama schedule, which has seen the development of popular short run shows such as Collision and Above Suspicion, and not on cost-cutting grounds. ITV intends to use the multimillion-pound saving from axing The Bill to create shorter run drama series for the 9pm slot with projects in the works including a new medical series with writer Peter Bowker and a new series from Collision and Foyle's War writer Anthony Horowitz. "The Bill has been a fixture on our screens for more than 25 years and has been the home of some of the UK's best serial drama storylines, and a great showcase for terrific scriptwriting and fine acting talent," said Peter Fincham, the ITV director of television, channels and online. "But times change, and so do the tastes of our audience. Whilst The Bill will come to an end in 2010, we will continue to invest more in drama programming than any other commercial broadcaster in the UK and viewers can look forward to a wide range of high quality drama on ITV1." In the current economic climate the chances of The Bill being picked up by another broadcaster seems slim, with one source describing the costly show as "a victim of circumstance".

South Korean navy ship sinks off North Korean coast
The ship was carrying about 100 personnel About 40 sailors are missing after a South Korean navy ship sank near the border with North Korea, Yonhap news agency said citing military officials. The patrol vessel, with 104 people aboard, sank after an unexplained explosion tore through its hull. Several sailors also died, officials are quoted saying as divers prepared to return to the scene after daybreak. South Korean officials played down earlier reports that it may have been the result of an attack by North Korea. There was no sign of the North's military in the area where the ship sank, Yonhap said citing officials. The military earlier said 58 sailors were rescued from near Baengnyeong island by several navy and coastguard vessels. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, who had convened an emergency meeting of security officials, had ordered the military to focus on rescuing the sailors, Yonhap news agency reported. A South Korean presidential spokeswoman said it was premature to say what caused the Cheonan to sink. Strained ties There were reports that another South Korean ship had fired shots toward an unidentified ship in the North following the alleged torpedo attack.

Pakistan: Peshawar hit by triple bomb blasts
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A terrorist attack near the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar, Pakistan, killed two consulate security guards and at least six others Monday, authorities said. The two consulate employees who died were Pakistani, the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad said, and "a number of others were seriously wounded." At least eight people were killed in all, a government official said. All U.S. citizens were accounted for, and some had minor injuries, State Department spokesman P.J. The coordinated attack involved a vehicle suicide bomb and attackers who tried to enter the consulate by using grenades and weapons fire, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. The blasts in the capital of the North West Frontier Province came hours after a suicide attack killed at least 30 people and wounded 50 others in another part of the province. The U.S. Embassy, in its statement, said the two attacks reflect "the terrorists' desperation as they are rejected by people throughout Pakistan." Peshawar is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) from Islamabad, the country's capital. Bashir Ahmad Bilour, a senior provincial minister, told reporters at the scene that several militants came in two vehicles. The dead included two Pakistani security personnel working for the U.S. Consulate, one policeman, two civilians and three unidentified bodies, said Karim Khan, a senior police official in Peshawar.

US military to carry out review following Wikileaks release of classified 2007 video
Advertisement The US military is reviewing a video of a controversial helicopter attack on a group of people in Iraq in 2007, officials say. The review comes after footage of the attack was published online by the website WikiLeaks, gaining 4.1 million YouTube viewings. There are, however, no plans to reopen an investigation into the case, a US Central Command spokesman says. An earlier probe into the case cleared the helicopter crew of any war crimes. "Military attorneys are looking at it," a US official, who spoke under condition of anonymity, was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Reuters photographer Namir Noor-Eldeen, 22, and his driver and assistant Saeed Chmagh, 40, were both killed in the attack when their cameras were mistaken for weapons, US officials say. "I would welcome a thorough new investigation. Reuters from the start has called for transparency and an objective inquiry so that all can learn lessons from this tragedy," Reuters editor-in-chief David Schlesinger said in a statement. "Wikileaks has had more scoops in three years than the Washington Post has had in 30," tweets the internet guru Clay Shirky, and he has a point. The latest and perhaps the most famous (or infamous) is the graphic video Wikileaks unveiled this week of a US Army attack in Iraq in 2007 that left 12 people dead, including two employees of Reuters. The US magazine Mother Jones has an profile of the secret-busting site: WikiLeaks' commitment to what might be called extreme transparency also means that it won't turn away documents that have questionable news value or are just plain dishy. According to WikiLeaks' credo, to refuse a leak is tantamount to helping the bad guys.

UK Prime Minister announces date for general election
Political leaders have headed off on the campaign trail after Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced the UK general election would be held on 6 May. He said he would seek a "clear" mandate to continue the "road to recovery", as Labour bids for a fourth term. David Cameron, whose Conservative Party has been ahead in the polls, said they offered "hope" and a "fresh start". Nick Clegg, leader of the UK's third biggest party the Liberal Democrats, said only they offered "real change". Shortly after announcing the date at Downing Street, Mr Brown boarded a train and headed to Kent to meet voters at a supermarket in Rochester. Mr Cameron headed to a hospital in Edgbaston, Birmingham, before addressing a rally in Leeds while Mr Clegg met young people in Watford. He said he would be travelling the country telling voters: "Britain is on the road to recovery and nothing we do should put that recovery at risk." CORRESPONDENT VIEW Ben Wright BBC political correspondent So today we have Labour pitching itself to voters as the party of experience - stewards of an economic recovery that's still fragile, and protector of public services. Gordon Brown is asking the country to stick with him and not risk a switch to the Conservatives.

25 dead after mine explosion in West Virginia
MONTCOAL, W.Va. — Rescue workers began the precarious task Tuesday of removing explosive methane gas from the coal mine where at least 25 miners died the day before. The mine owner’s dismal safety record, along with several recent evacuations of the mine, left federal officials and miners suggesting that Monday’s explosion might have been preventable. In the past two months, miners had been evacuated three times from the Upper Big Branch because of dangerously high methane levels, according to two miners who asked for anonymity for fear of losing their jobs. Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a Democrat whose district includes the mine, said he had received similar reports from miners about recent evacuations at the mine, which as recently as last month was fined at least three times for ventilation problems, according to federal records. The Massey Energy Company, the biggest coal mining business in central Appalachia and the owner of the Upper Big Branch mine, has drawn sharp scrutiny and fines from regulators over its safety and environmental record. That year, Massey also paid a $20 million fine — the largest of its kind levied by the Environmental Protection Agency — for clean water violations. It is still unclear what caused Monday’s blast, which is under investigation. But the disaster has raised new questions about Massey’s attention to safety under the leadership of its pugnacious chief executive, Don L. Blankenship, and about why stricter federal laws, put into effect after a mining disaster in 2006, failed to prevent another tragedy. Kevin Stricklin, an administrator with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, said the magnitude of the explosion — the worst mining accident in 25 years, which also left four people missing, including a woman working as a mining operator — showed that “something went very wrong here.” “All explosions are preventable,” Mr. Stricklin said. “It’s just making sure you have things in place to keep one from occurring.” Mr. Rahall said that even veteran rescue workers, some with decades of experience, had told him they were shocked by what they saw inside the mine.

Heavy earthquake hits Sumatra, Indonesia
A magnitude 7.7 earthquake shook Indonesia's northwest island of Sumatra early Wednesday, prompting a brief tsunami warning and sending panicked residents rushing for higher ground. There were scattered reports of injuries, but only minor damage in most areas. The quake struck at 5:15 a.m. local time and was centred 205 kilometres northwest of the coastal town of Sibolga in Sumatra at a depth of 31 kilometres, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It had earlier said the quake measured 7.8. Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu issued tsunami warnings following the quake, but lifted them two hours later. A hospital on Simeulue island off the coast of Sumatra admitted 17 people for treatment of injuries sustained in the quake, including four in critical condition, said Capt. He said no larger buildings were reported damaged, but electricity had been knocked out on the island. "We are still collecting reports of damages and injuries ... but the situation has returned to normal and people are going back home," he said. Local network Metro TV reported that a dormitory for nurses partly collapsed in Aceh province's Singkil district and one woman suffered minor injuries in the rush to get out of the building. It said fires sparked by the quake had burned at least 14 houses in Medan, the capital city of North Sumatra province. Paulus Prihandojo, another seismologist with the meteorology agency, said along with the quake's relative depth, the epicentre was too far away from the major population centres of Medan and Banda Aceh to cause major damage.

UK interest rates remain at 0.5%
MPC keeps interest rates at historic low despite manufacturing recovery that has allayed fears of double-dip recession The Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) kept interest rates at 0.5% today despite a strong recovery in manufacturing during February that allayed fears of a double-dip recession. The committee of nine economists and Bank of England staff also maintained the programme of quantitative easing (QE), or printing money, at £200bn. Most economists expected the rates freeze after Britain continued to struggle out of recession. While figures from the services sector showed a slight upward trend over the past few months and the UK moved out of recession faster than originally thought in the fourth quarter of 2009, economists believe there could still be bumps on the road to recovery. The looming general election may also play a part in a decision to keep things as they are. A decline in the value of the pound has failed to lift exports significantly. The German economy has stagnated and other trading partners have found their economies stuck in the doldrums, leaving UK exporters with few options when they search for growth. Meanwhile, the fall in February's rate of inflation to 3%, from 3.5% in January, and depressed house prices after a year of modest rises, have soothed concerns about pressure on the Bank for rate hikes. Halifax figures for March showed a 1.1% rise in prices, but most economists expect prices to stagnate in 2010 or decline. The minutes of the Bank's last meeting in March showed "different inferences" over inflation risks as some members worried that growing momentum behind recovery and a weak pound could keep it above the 2% target for longer.

Obama, Medvedev sign treaty cutting nuclear stockpiles
U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev have signed a treaty to reduce their countries' nuclear stockpiles by 25 to 30 percent over seven years. In the Spanish Hall, an ornate chamber within the Czech capital's presidential castle, the two countries, which own more than 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons, agreed to downsize their arsenals. Presidents Obama and Medvedev sat in front of U.S. and Russian flags and signed their countries' first major nuclear arms reduction accord in almost two decades. Mr. Obama said the treaty is a big step forward for world security. "Today is an important milestone for nuclear security and nonproliferation and for U.S.-Russia relations," he said. "That enabled us to do something that just a couple of months ago looked like 'mission impossible.' Within a short span of time we prepared a full-fledged treaty and signed it," he said. The new ten-year pact requires the U.S. and Russia to cut their inventory of nuclear warheads to about 1,500 each in the next seven years. Mr. Obama says, in addition, that the treaty paves the way for future arms reduction talks with Russia, mainly on short-range nuclear weapons. Tom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association, says the new treaty is significant in reducing the threat from U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons, but more significant because it could lead to further cuts.

Polish President Lech Kaczyński dies as his plane crashes in Russia
President Lech Kaczynski and scores of other senior Polish figures have been killed in a plane crash in Russia. Polish and Russian officials said no-one survived after the plane apparently hit trees as it approached Smolensk airport in thick fog. Russian media reports said the pilots ignored advice from air traffic control to divert to another airport. Poland's army chief, central bank governor, MPs and leading historians were among more than 80 passengers. Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the crash was the most tragic event of the country's post-World War II history. The Polish delegation was flying in from Warsaw to mark the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre of thousands of Poles by Soviet forces during WWII. Obituary: Lech Kaczynski In pictures: Plane crash Your reaction The BBC's Adam Easton, in Warsaw, says the crash is a catastrophe for the Polish people. After an emergency meeting of ministers, Mr Tusk, who runs the day-to-day business of government, said a week of national mourning had been declared with two minutes of silence on Sunday at midday. Thousands have gathered outside the presidential palace in Warsaw A government spokesman said that according to the constitution there would be an early presidential election, and the speaker of the lower house of parliament, Bronislaw Komorowski, would be acting president. In Warsaw, people gathered outside the presidential palace to lay flowers and light candles. "I'm all broken up... it cannot be expressed in words," Ewa Robaczewska told Reuters news agency.

Car bomb explodes near MI5 army base in Northern Ireland
The bomb was placed in a taxi which was hijacked in north Belfast The Real IRA has admitted it was behind a car bomb which exploded outside the army base which houses MI5's Northern Ireland headquarters. The blast came on the day that David Ford was elected as NI's Justice Minister, the first local politician to hold the job in 38 years. An elderly man walking near the barracks at the time was treated for minor injuries. The bomb was placed in a taxi, which had been hijacked in the Ligoniel area of north Belfast, about seven miles from Holywood, at about 2150 BST. The driver was held hostage by three men for about two hours before being told to drive his taxi to the barracks. The vehicle was abandoned at the base just before midnight prompting police and security staff to evacuate the area. The bomb exploded about 20 minutes later as the evacuation was still taking place. There were two explosions - first the bomb and then the petrol tank, destroying the car and damaging other property. Mr Ford, the new justice minister, said the bombing was a cynical attempt to intimidate politicians ahead of Monday's vote.

6.9 magnitude earthquake hits western China
Special Report: 7.1-Magnitude Earthquake hits China's Qinghai Backgrounder: Quake-hit Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yushu in Qinghai Province YUSHU, Qinghai, April 14 (Xinhua) -- About 300 people have died and 8,000 others were injured after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit northwest China's Qinghai Province early on Wednesday, a local official said. Many others are still buried under the debris of collapsed houses near the epicenter, said Huang Limin, deputy secretary-general of the government of the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yushu. About 700 soldiers are now struggling to clear away the rubble and rescue the buried people, a spokesman with the Qinghai Provincial Emergency Office said. More than 5,000 additional rescuers, including soldiers and medical workers have been dispatched to the quake-hit region, according to a news conference held by the Qinghai provincial government. Advertisement At least 300 people have died and thousands are feared hurt after a magnitude-6.9 earthquake struck China's Qinghai province, officials say.

Rescue efforts underway after China earthquake
Rescuers were using shovels and their bare hands and working in freezing temperatures. Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, called for an all-out effort to save as many people as possible, with more than 5,000 rescuers including soldiers sent to the disaster zone and the government saying it would provide more than $29m in aid. Logistical hurdles While China's military is well-practiced in responding to disasters, the remote location is posing logistical difficulties. From our correspondent Al Jazeera's Melissa Chan, reporting from Yushu town on Thursday, said it is a very long drive through a mountainous region, with landslides partially blocking the road, to reach the quake zone. "One of the challenges is going to be the altitude … getting to this area can be quite tough and it is taxing on people who are not used to the high elevation," she said. The airport in provincial capital Xining, the nearest big city 860km away, was filled with Chinese troops, firefighters and rescue teams leading dozens of sniffer dogs early on Thursday. They were whisked on to waiting buses for the difficult drive to the quake zone, but that journey takes 12 hours under the best of conditions. Crews set up emergency generators to restore operations at Yushu's airport, and by late afternoon on Wednesday the first of six flights had landed carrying rescue workers and equipment. The small Yushu airport also has no refuelling supplies, so relief flights were carrying extra jet fuel, reducing their capacity for hauling emergency supplies, state media reported. In the cold Still, the rescue effort appeared to be very well-organised, our correspondent said, with many of the convoys already in town bearing signs saying that they had also been at the Sichuan quake in 2008.

European airspace closed by volcanic ash
Advertisement Flights across much of the UK have been grounded for a second day as volcanic ash from Iceland drifts across Europe, posing a potential threat to aircraft. Air traffic control body Nats said airspace restrictions would be lifted in most of Scotland and Northern Ireland from 1900 BST on Friday. But it extended restrictions on airspace in England and Wales until at least 0700 BST on Saturday. European controllers said some 17,000 flights had been cancelled on Friday. The partial lifting of Scottish restrictions on Friday will also cover Shetland and the Orkneys, and will also mean some North Atlantic traffic will be able to operate, Nats said. The disruption is major and unprecedented in Europe [but] unavoidable given the nature of the current problem Brian Flynn Eurocontrol Live: Volcanic cloud over Europe Volcanic ash reaches ground level Two planes were able to fly in and one left Manchester by lunchtime on Friday. Over the next 24 to 36 hours, prevailing winds will shift slightly to drive the central part of the ash plume further to the north toward Scandinavia, according to BBC weather forecaster Matt Taylor. "However, later this weekend, they will return to a northwesterly direction and are more likely to bring the risk of ash back to the UK." Although the winds can be predicted, the crucial factor is how much ash the still-erupting volcano is pumping into the atmosphere. Hundreds of thousands of people have been stranded in the UK or abroad, many unable to return home as a result of the flight cancellations. She said: "We are a party of 10 people including four children, one diabetic, one with ADHD and Aspergers, and a blind lady.

Government officials say they will investigate just how three leaders of the anti-government protests managed to escape when police tried to surround their hotel Friday. One of the leaders climbed down three floors using a rope, and was rushed away by supporters thronging the building. Protest supporter Sanyiam Puy-Thong, who was outside the hotel, says he heard explosions or gunfire inside the building. "Government have the order, would like to catch our leader.

Europe's airline chaos: in depth
 Virtually all of Europe's major airports remain closed as a huge plume of volcanic ash drifts south and east across the continent from Iceland. Millions of air travellers are stranded as thousands of flights are being cancelled for a third day. The disruption from the spread of ash would continue into Sunday, European aviation agency Eurocontrol said. Airlines are losing some £130m ($200m) a day in an unprecedented shutdown of commercial air travel. "Forecasts suggest that the cloud of volcanic ash will persist and that the impact will continue for at least the next 24 hours," a statement from Eurocontrol said at around 0830 GMT. Many countries and airlines have grounded fleets as the ash - a mixture of glass, sand and rock particles, drifting from 5,000ft (1,500m) - can seriously damage aircraft engines. Some 18,000 of the 28,000 daily flights in the affected zone were cancelled on Friday, twice as many as the day before. The UK extended its ban on commercial flights until at least 0700 local time (0600 GMT) on Sunday. Many other countries, from Ireland to Ukraine, have either closed airspace or shut key airports. The disruption has now affected millions of travellers since Wednesday when the Eyjafjallajoekull volcano began erupting for the second time in a month. Scientists in Iceland said they hoped to fly above the volcano to assess how much ice has melted, now that winds have cleared visibility.

Half of Europe's flights could take off Monday, EU says
 EU transport ministers are to hold emergency talks by video conference on easing the air travel crisis caused by a volcanic ash cloud in Europe's skies. More than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far, as the crisis enters its fifth day. Airports and airlines are questioning the need for curbs said to be costing airlines $200m (£130m) a day. "We must move away from this blanket closure and find ways to flexibly open air space, step by step," IATA head Giovanni Bisignani told a news briefing in Paris. MAJOR EU AIRPORTS 0800 19/04 Heathrow - closed Frankfurt - closed after reopening on a limited basis for several hours on Sunday Paris Charles de Gaulle - closed Schipol, Amsterdam - closed Rome - limited service Madrid - limited service The enormous shroud of fine mineral dust particles now stretches from the Arctic Circle in the north to the French Mediterranean coast in the south, and from Spain into Russia. Airspace remains closed, or partially closed, in more than 20 countries. Sixty-three thousand flights have been cancelled in the four days since the clampdown began. And the prospect of a return to normal air travel remains far from clear. The Spanish Minister for Europe, Diego Lopez Garrido, had said on Sunday that up to half of the flights across Europe could operate on Monday. He was speaking after talks with Eurocontrol, which co-ordinates air traffic control in 38 nations. But Brian Flynn, deputy head of operations for Eurocontrol, told the BBC that while half of the European landmass could be clear of ash cloud, that did not mean half of the flights could go ahead.

British government apologises for suggesting the Pope could create a brand of "Benedict" condoms
The Foreign Office has apologised for a "foolish" document suggesting the Pope could launch "Benedict" condoms during his visit to the UK this year. The memo also suggested the pontiff could be invited to open an abortion clinic and bless a gay marriage. The Foreign Office stressed the paper, which resulted from a "brainstorm" on the visit, did not reflect its views. The trip by Pope Benedict XVI could not have come at a more difficult time for a Catholic Church embroiled in a wide-reaching child abuse scandal and a simmering, theological row with the Church of England. The need for the British Government to handle the pontiff’s stay with the greatest sensitivity could not have been more obvious. Yet last night that decision had backfired spectacularly, with the emergence of an official document circulated around Whitehall — and leaked to The Sunday Telegraph — which mocked the Pope and ridiculed the teachings of the Catholic Church. The Foreign Office was forced to make the most fulsome of apologies, while a senior civil servant has been transferred to other duties. Among the proposals put forward by members of the Papal Visit Team during a “brainstorming” session and included in the document, headed “The ideal visit would see ...”, were plans for the Pope to open an abortion ward and bless a gay marriage. They also thought he might, while here in September, launch a range of “Benedict” condoms and that he should drop the Church’s opposition to homosexual couples being able to adopt.

Oil spill in Gulf of Mexico reported to have reached coast; offshore drilling ban announced by Obama administration
NEW ORLEANS — Officials in the Obama administration began for the first time Friday to publicly chastise BP America for its handling of the spreading oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico, calling the oil company’s current resources inadequate to stop what is unfolding into an environmental catastrophe. As oil edged toward the Louisiana coast, fears continued to grow that the leak from the seabed oil well could spiral out of control. One official at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in a widely distributed warning on Friday, said the oil flow could grow from the current estimate of 5,000 barrels a day to “an order of magnitude higher than that.” The increased level of concern was reflected in the sharp new criticism by federal officials of BP for not stopping the leak and cleaning up the spill before it reached land, something the company’s officials had said was possible earlier in the week. “It is clear that after several unsuccessful attempts to secure the source of the leak, it is time for BP to supplement their current mobilization as the slick of oil moves toward shore,” Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said pointedly, as the government announced steps to supplement its response with people and equipment from the Defense Department. Geoffrey S. Morrell, deputy assistant secretary of defense, said in a statement that the government would hold BP accountable for the cost of the department’s deployment, which as of Friday night included the Louisiana National Guard to help clean up coastal areas once the oil comes ashore. BP officials said they did everything possible, and a review of the response suggests it may be too simplistic to place all the blame on the oil company. The federal government also had opportunities to move more quickly, but did not do so while it waited for a resolution to the spreading spill from BP, which was leasing the drilling rig that exploded in flames on April 20 and sank two days later. The Department of Homeland Security waited until Thursday to declare that the incident was “a spill of national significance,” and then set up a second command center in Mobile. The actions came only after the estimate of the size of the spill was increased fivefold to 5,000 barrels a day. The delay meant that the Homeland Security Department waited until late this week to formally request a more robust response from the Department of Defense, with Ms. Napolitano acknowledging even as late as Thursday afternoon that she did not know if the Defense Department even had equipment that might be helpful. By Friday afternoon, she said, the Defense Department had agreed to send two large military transport planes to spray chemicals that can disperse the oil while it is still in the Gulf. Officials initially seemed to underestimate the threat of a leak, just as BP did last year when it told the government such an event was highly unlikely. Rear Adm. Mary E. Landry, the chief Coast Guard official in charge of the response, said on April 22, after the rig sank, that the oil that was on the surface appeared to be merely residual oil from the fire, though she said it was unclear what was going on underwater. The day after, officials said that it appeared the well’s blowout preventer had kicked in and that there did not seem to be any oil leaking from the well, though they cautioned it was not a guarantee.

Bomb scare closes Times Square, New York
A crude car bomb of propane, gasoline and fireworks was discovered in a smoking Nissan Pathfinder in the heart of Times Square on Saturday evening, prompting the evacuation of thousands of tourists and theatergoers on a warm and busy night. Although the device had apparently started to detonate, there was no explosion, and early on Sunday the authorities were still seeking a suspect and motive. “We are very lucky,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a 2:15 a.m. press conference. “We avoided what could have been a very deadly event.” A large swath of Midtown — from 43rd Street to 48th Street, and from Sixth to Eighth Avenues — was closed for much of the evening after the Pathfinder was discovered just off Broadway on 45th Street. Several theaters and stores, as well as the South Tower of the New York Marriott Marquis Hotel, were evacuated. David A. Paterson, Police Commissioner Raymond W.

Moments later, a T-shirt vendor on the sidewalk saw smoke coming out of vents near the back seat of the S.U.V., which was now parked awkwardly at the curb with its engine running and its hazard lights on. The vendor called to a mounted police officer, the mayor said, who smelled gunpowder when he approached the S.U.V. Police officers from the emergency service unit and firefighters flooded the area and were troubled by the hazard lights and running engine, and by the fact that the S.U.V.

Continental and United Airlines to merge
The $3 billion merger of UAL Corp. and Continental Airlines Inc. is expected to incur $1.2 billion in one-time transaction costs over three years, assuming the deal passes muster with antitrust regulators, the companies said Monday. The resulting company, United Continental Holdings Inc., would be the world's largest airline by traffic, with an equity value of $8.3 billion at current share prices on a fully diluted basis. First, United’s fortunes have begun to turn around after deep cost and capacity cuts. And as the economy starts to improve, airlines are eager to position themselves for a rebound in air travel, particularly from lucrative business travelers.

Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua reported dead
Media requires JavaScript to play. Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua has died at his presidential villa following a long illness. The government announced seven days of national mourning and said the president would be buried on Thursday. Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan has been sworn in as head of state in a ceremony in the capital Abuja. Mr Yar'Adua, 58, came to power in 2007 promising many reforms. Analysts say he made the most progress in tackling unrest in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Nigerian TV interrupted normal programming to announce the news in a brief statement early on Thursday. ANALYSIS Martin Plaut, BBC World Service Africa editor The uncertainty at the heart of Nigeria has been tremendously destabilising. There has been considerable unrest in the central state of Jos recently with clashes between Muslims and Christians, and people put this down partly at least to the fact that there was not a firm hand at the centre of power. Goodluck Jonathan is already exercising control. But this does cause difficulties because there is a convention that this was the turn of the Nigerian Muslims from the north to control Nigeria and Goodluck Jonathan is from the south.

Russia agrees to construct Turkish nuclear reactor
The two countries want to double bilateral trade in five years President Dmitry Medvedev has agreed a deal under which Russia will build Turkey's first nuclear power plant. Russia will have a controlling stake in the plant, which is likely to cost $20bn (£13.5bn) and is to be built on Turkey's Mediterranean coast. It was one of several agreements struck by Mr Medvedev during a visit to Ankara, the Turkish capital. Both countries said they wished to improve trade links, lift visa conditions and boost energy projects. "We share a determination to increase the trade volume from a current $38bn to $100bn in five years," Turkish President Abdullah Gul said after hosting talks with Mr Medvedev. ISTANBUL—Russia and Turkey signed several energy and trade agreements Wednesday, tying the knot in a relationship between historic rivals that has quietly grown into what Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev described as "a full-scale strategic partnership." “Our shores are under severe danger during the passage of the oil tankers through the straits,” he said. “Once we realize the Samsun-Ceyhan pipeline, we would have the opportunity to reach out to the world from Ceyhan.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story For his part, Mr. Medvedev highlighted the expected increases in the $30 billion in trade between Turkey and Russia. “Our trading capacity will not only improve but will exceed past records,” Mr. Medvedev said. “We are aiming for more than $100 billion of trade in future, which is very inspiring.” His comments, in Russian, were translated by Turkish television.

US Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan meets with senators on Capitol Hill
Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan on Wednesday kicked off what has become a ritual for modern high court nominees: making the rounds of key senators' offices on Capitol Hill while saying little to a boisterous press corps in tow. Kagan, who won confirmation as solicitor general a little more than a year ago, started her day meeting with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. She then huddled with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky; Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont; and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the committee's top Republican. Democrats offered overwhelming praise for the 50-year-old nominee, saying she would be a fair, independent member of the high court and a worthy replacement for retiring Justice John Paul Stevens. Republicans questioned, among other things, Kagan's lack of experience on the federal bench and whether she would be willing to oppose President Obama's agenda when necessary. "There's nothing more exciting than the [confirmation process] we're about to undertake," Reid told Kagan. "The great country that we're in is ruled by law, and that's what you're going to make sure continues." Reid later issued a statement that said his meeting left him confident that Kagan "is the right choice to replace Justice Stevens on the Supreme Court. She has a strong belief that the Supreme Court should be a forum where the rule of law wins out and where people from every walk of life can receive a fair hearing." And it's a question that needs to be answered." "Americans want to know that Ms. Kagan will be independent, that she won't prejudge cases based on her personal opinions, [and] that she'll treat everyone equally, as the judicial oath requires."

Interim Kyrgyz government retakes buildings after violent protests
“The former president again spilled the blood of Kyrgyz citizens,” Ms. Otunbayeva said in a statement carried by local news media. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Government officials said Thursday that they would not use police force, but instead would encourage supporters to swarm into the buildings held by armed followers of Mr. Bakiyev. The result was a strange tableau of violence as the pro-government groups — some peaceful and some armed with sticks, rocks and rifles — stormed the government buildings while uniformed police officers and special forces largely stayed on the sidelines, witnesses said. The loyalty of those forces in the south has been in question. Kyrgyzstan, in Central Asia, is the home of a base used to supply the United States-led war in Afghanistan. They are unelected and have no formal legitimacy, and it remains unclear whom the police and the army are siding with, particularly in the south.

Efforts to cap Deepwater Horizon oil spill delayed again
— As BP’s experimental efforts to reduce the flow of oil spewing from disabled well in the Gulf of Mexico met another obstacle, the Obama administration sought assurances from BP that it would not attempt to limit its liability to the $75 million prescribed by law. In a letter sent Friday to Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive officer, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano cited statements by BP officials that the company would pay all legitimate claims and that the company considered the $75 million cap “irrelevant.” “Based on these statements, we understand that BP will not in any way seek to rely on the potential $75 million statutory cap to refuse to provide compensation to any individuals or others harmed by the oil spill, even if more than $75 million is required to provide full compensation to all claimants, and BP will not seek reimbursement from the American taxpayers, the United States government or the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for any amount,” the two cabinet members wrote in their letter, which was made public on Saturday. “In the event that our understanding is inaccurate, we request immediate public clarification of BP’s true intentions,” they wrote. BP says the new dome should be working by the end of the week A new steel dome has been placed beside the damaged oil well that has been polluting the Gulf of Mexico since last month's drilling rig disaster, BP says. Dubbed the "top hat", it is smaller than a first container dome which had to be set aside after becoming blocked by crystallised gas hydrates. It is on the seabed but is being kept away from the well for now, BP said. The cost of tackling the spill is being put at $118m (£80m), much of which the Obama administration expects BP to pay. The figure is contained in legislation sent to Congress, which would also increase a tax on oil companies to provide funds for clear-up work. The bill would also raise the liability cap on how much oil companies must pay for economic damage caused by a spill at one of their wells. A National Marine Fisheries Service official said none of them had obvious signs of oil and it was common for dead dolphins to wash up at this time of year, when they are in shallow waters to calve.

Afghanistan: Suicide attackers kill several people in Kabul
Advertisement A suicide car bomber has killed 18 people - including five US soldiers - and injured 52 more in the deadliest attack this year on foreign troops in the Afghan capital. Most of the victims were Afghan civilians caught in the blast when the bomber targeted a Nato-led convoy. The bomber struck during rush hour close to the parliament. Taliban militants said they had carried out the attack, using a van packed with 750kg (1,650lb) of explosives. ANALYSIS Nick Childs, BBC defence and security correspondent Nato is making no bones about the fact that it's trying to wrest the military initiative in Afghanistan back from the insurgents. So, in the battle for perceptions and hearts and minds, this will be a serious blow, with the high loss of life both of Nato troops and local civilians. It also highlights the fact that, despite increased efforts, it is impossible completely to eliminate such attacks. And such so-called "spectaculars", especially in the capital, remain a potent weapon for the insurgents, even as the Nato-led forces prepare to continue their own new strategy centred around retaking control in the south. Despite tight security, the suicide bomber managed to drive into the city in a car laden with explosives. The convoy was attacked on the Darulaman road, one of the main roads in the city. A spokesman for the Nato-led international peacekeeping force Isaf confirmed that six of its soldiers had been killed. Apart from the five US soldiers, one Canadian is believed to have been killed. Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen "strongly" condemned the attack, but said the alliance remained "committed to its mission to protect the Afghan people and to strengthen Afghanistan's ability to resist terrorism".

Image caption The synthetic cell looks identical to the 'wild type' Scientists in the US have succeeded in developing the first living cell to be controlled entirely by synthetic DNA. The researchers constructed a bacterium's "genetic software" and transplanted it into a host cell. The resulting microbe then looked and behaved like the species "dictated" by the synthetic DNA. Some also suggest that the potential benefits of the technology have been over-stated. But the researchers hope eventually to design bacterial cells that will produce medicines and fuels and even absorb greenhouse gases. He and his colleagues had previously made a synthetic bacterial genome, and transplanted the genome of one bacterium into another. Now, the scientists have put both methods together, to create what they call a "synthetic cell", although only its genome is truly synthetic.

New BP oil spill plan
BP uncertain mud plug will stop leak Updated Frustration is mounting in Washington over BP's failure to seal the leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, but senior Obama administration officials say there is no viable alternative. The oil company has delayed an attempt at plugging the leaking well with heavy mud and cement until later in the week. And after more than a month of leaking oil, the people of America's Gulf Coast have had enough of missed deadlines and excuses. They can see the oil now and know there is more coming. Louisiana's Republican governor Bobby Jindal has described what he saw touring some of the worst affected islands and wetlands. "We saw islands covered in oil where our brown pelicans nest," he said. "We could actually see multiple birds oiled, some to the point where they couldn't fly. The government has declared a "fishery disaster" in the seafood-producing states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, making them eligible for federal funds. With BP failing to shut off the damaged well, Mr Jindal is demanding an emergency permit from US federal authorities to use dredges to build barrier islands to try and hold back the pollution. But homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano says Washington is worried that such a drastic move could have other, unintended, consequences.

BP says Gulf oil spill slowed as estimates of oil spilled increase
BP has slowed the flow of oil and gas from a ruptured well into the Gulf of Mexico, a US official told local media. The company's "top kill" effort has "stabilised the wellhead", Coast Guard commander Admiral Thad Allen said. But he cautioned it was too early to declare success. This is the first step in BP's plan to seal the well for good. Meanwhile, a panel of US scientists said the oil leak was much worse than previously estimated, making it the nation's worst spill. US Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt saidBP 'slows leaking Gulf oil well' government teams estimated the flow ranges from 12,000 barrels (504,000 gallons or 1.9 million litres) to 25,000 barrels per day. Up to now, BP had estimated the leak at 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons) per day, while cautioning that figure was unreliable. If the new estimates are confirmed, it would mean the leak has far eclipsed the previous worst oil spill in US history - the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster. Official resigns Later on Thursday, President Barack Obama is expected to extend a moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling for six months, the White House has said. 'Low pressure' Adm Allen told US media the "top kill" procedure, which began on Wednesday, has pumped enough drilling fluid to block some of the oil and gas escaping from the well.

At least 65 dead after train derailment in West Bengal, India
Maoist guerillas are believed to be behind the blast in their West Bengal stronghold. If confirmed it would mark a major escalation of their insurgency in the state and a shift from military to civilian targets. Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has described the Maoist rebellion as the country's greatest internal security challenge - they are a powerful force in one-third of India's 600-plus districts. The explosion follows a number of Maoist attack attacks in recent weeks, including an ambush which killed 76 Indian paramilitary police in Chhattisgarh and an attack on a bus which left 35 dead. This time the attackers struck at 1:30am as the Mumbai-Calcutta Gyaneshwari Express passed through Jhargram in West Midnapore, West Bengal, just over 80 miles from its destination. The driver heard an explosion which derailed 13 of the train's coaches and hurled five of them into the path of an on-coming freight train. India's railways minister Mamata Bannerjee said the incident was "definitely sabotage" and that a bomb attack had derailed the train. "From whatever I have been told the apprehension is the Maoists were involved," she said. Police investigating the attack said they were also exploring whether the removal of the track's "fish plates" by saboteurs had caused the derailment and collision. A detail investigation will reveal more, but definitely there was lot of tinkering done to the tracks," Vivek Sahay, a senior railway official, said. Television pictures showed the mangled carriages as rescue workers fought to cut survivors from the wreckage.

We succeeded doing this peacefully with five of the six ships. The sixth ship, the largest, which had hundreds of people on it, not only did not co-operate in this effort, peacefully, they deliberately attacked the first soldiers that came on the ship.

Image caption The Rachel Corrie was taken to Ashdod under military escort An aid ship intercepted by the Israeli military while trying to break the blockade of Gaza has arrived in the Israeli port of Ashdod. Israel says its soldiers boarded the Irish-owned Rachel Corrie from the sea and did not meet any resistance. There has been no word from those on board, who include several activists. The incident comes five days after nine people were killed in clashes when troops boarded a Turkish aid ship, prompting international criticism. Turkish officials have released details of autopsies carried out on the nine dead activists, saying a total of 30 bullets had been found in their bodies. One of the activists was shot four times in the head, the officials said. Israel said it would transfer the aid to the Gaza Strip by land after checking the cargo for banned items.

Mary Hughes Thompson, a co-founder of the Free Gaza Movement which organised the shipment, told the BBC she was "outraged" by the latest Israeli action. "They [the Israelis] once again went into international water and violently boarded a boat and forced people against their will to go to Israel, when all we wanted was to be left to go to Gaza, which is our goal," she said.

"We ask for respect for our privacy and that of our family, and we do not intend to comment further." Al Gore, 62, a Democrat, who was Bill Clinton's vice president for eight years, narrowly lost the presidency to Republican George W. Bush in 2000 and won a Nobel Peace Prize and an Academy Award in 2007 for his work against global climate change. Tipper Gore, 61, is an avid photographer whose photos are linked on www.algore.com. She was active in the 1980s in trying to get record companies to put warning labels on their records about profane lyrics. The Gores left the impression of a couple deeply in love during the Democratic National Convention in 2000, when they exchanged a long, passionate kiss on stage that became famous.

French Open: Stosur and Schiavone to compete in women's final; Nadal to meet Soderling in men's final
(CNN) -- Sweden's Robin Soderling ended world number one Roger Federer's defense of his French Open crown after a rain-affected four-set victory at Roland Garros. Soderling had never beaten Federer in their 12 previous meetings but battled back from a set down to record a 3-6 6-3 7-5 6-4 triumph in just under three hours. Federer's defeat ended his incredible run of reaching 23 Grand Slam semifinals in a row, and he could lose his world number one status by the end of the tournament if Rafael Nadal regains the French Open title. Fifth seed Soderling looked to be heading for another defeat as Federer took the opening set in just over half an hour after breaking in the eighth game. But Soderling rallied superbly in the second to win the first three games and close out the set. The third went with serve until 5-5 when the players were forced off due to rain but when they returned Soderling broke Federer thanks to a fierce forehand winner. He then served out the match to seal his place in the final four. After the game Soderling told reporters: "First set he [Federer] played well, and I didn't serve too well, and he had some chances in the second set and I saved a couple of really important points. "I think when I won the second set, which was a very big thing, I felt I could relax. This is a big win but it's not the final and I don't want to celebrate too much, I want to focus on the next game."

Hewlett-Packard to cut 9,000 jobs in $1 billion restructuring plan
Image caption Hewlett-Packard cut 6,700 jobs last year to make savings Hewlett-Packard (HP) says it plans to spend $1bn (£686m) and shed 9,000 jobs over three years as it creates fully-automated commercial data centres. HP, the world's largest technology company by sales, says the job cuts will be the result of productivity gains and automation. HP said the resulting "next-generation services" would benefit clients. The firm said it would record a $1bn financial cost charge in the course of its 2013 financial year. "As a result of productivity gains and automation, HP expects to eliminate roughly 9,000 positions over a multi-year period to reinvest for further growth and to increase shareholder value," it said. It said the shake-up would make it annual gross savings of about $1bn and net savings "after reinvestment in a range between $500m and $700m". HP added that it would replace about 6,000 of the jobs that were lost, adding that the changes to the workforce would be made over time and would vary by country. And it said the commercial data centres would help its corporate clients run their businesses faster and more efficiently. The latest job losses come after 6,700 posts were shed last year to make savings. HP to cut workforce by 3,000   NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Hewlett-Packard plans to eliminate 3,000 jobs over the next few years as it ramps up its use of automated data centers for business customers, the company announced Tuesday. The world's largest computer company said it will invest $1 billion in building up its automated data centers to service business customers. HP will cut about 9,000 jobs in its enterprise services division as a result, but over the same time period, the company expects to add about 6,000 employees to its sales and delivery teams. HP (HPQ, Fortune 500) will take a charge of about $1 billion to reflect the investment, and expects it to pay off in annual savings of about the same. After reinvesting some of that money, HP expects these moves to boost annual pre-tax earnings by between $500 million and $700 million by fiscal year 2013.

Turkey mourns flotilla dead
Funerals have been held in Turkey for the nine activists killed when Israeli forces stormed their Gaza-bound aid flotilla. Coffins swathed in Turkish and Palestinian flags were taken to the Fatih Mosque in Istanbul as thousands gathered to mourn the dead, eight of whom were Turks and one a US national of Turkish origin. Cigdem Topcuoglu (L), the widow of activist Cetin Topcuoglu, reacts as she accepts condolences from a mourner next to the coffin of her husband, a national taekwando athlete. Injured activists also paid their respects after being deported from Israel and flown to a military airport in Turkey. Earlier, hundreds of other activists returned home after being expelled by Israel. Hundreds of Turkish nationals were flown to Istanbul, where they received an enthusiastic welcome from crowds of hundreds of supporters shouting anti-Israeli slogans. More than 30 Greek activists, three French activists and one US national were flown to Athens. They, too, were greeted by family and supporters shouting pro-Palestinian slogans. The bodies were flown from Israel to Istanbul, along with more than 450 activists, to a heroes' welcome. Israel has said there is no need for an international inquiry into the incident, insisting its own will meet the "highest international standards".

Large fires kill many in Dhaka, Bangladesh
Fire fighters work at the scene after a devastating fire in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, early June 4, 2010. (Xinhua/Cheng Zhang) The firefighters rushed to the spot soon and brought the fire under control after three hours of relentless efforts. "We'll pay 20,000 taka (285.71 U.S. dollars) as compenstation to the family of each victim," he said adding the government has already formed a probe committee which will give a report within seven days. This is the second deadly disaster to strike the capital in 72 hours after a five-story building collapsed on Tuesday night, killing 25 people. A devastating fire raced through several apartment complexes in the capital, Dhaka, on Thursday night, killing more than 100 people and injuring dozens, officials and local media reported. A fire official, Nazrul Islam, said the blaze started when an electric transformer exploded, igniting a three-story apartment building in the Najirabazar area of old Dhaka. The television station ATN Bangla reported Friday that at least 104 people had died, and that more than 100 people were injured. By Anis Ahmed DHAKA (Reuters) - At least 114 people were killed in a fire that razed a crowded, centuries-old Dhaka neighborhood overnight as rescue workers scrambled on Friday to pull bodies, many charred beyond recognition, from smoldering debris. The blaze, which broke out about 10.30 p.m., was the worst to sweep through the Bangladeshi capital in almost four decades. "The confirmed death toll from the fire is now 114 and may rise," Muhibul Haque, district commissioner of Dhaka, told Reuters. Fuelling the flames, which some witnesses said rose up to six-storeys high, were chemicals from illegal, home-based factories in the Kayettuli neighborhood, one of the most densely populated in Dhaka and in the heart of the city. "It seemed like hell broke loose," said a wailing woman, looking for her daughter and son in what remained of the area, home to several multi-storey blocks and tin-roofed dwellings.

WHO's reaction to H1N1 influenced by drug companies, reports claim
European criticism of the World Health Organization's handling of the H1N1 pandemic intensified Friday with the release of two reports that accused the agency of exaggerating the threat posed by the virus and failing to disclose possible influence by the pharmaceutical industry on its recommendations for how countries should respond. The WHO's response caused widespread, unnecessary fear and prompted countries to waste millions of dollars, according to one report. At the same time, the Geneva-based arm of the United Nations relied on advice from experts with ties to drug makers in developing the guidelines it used to encourage countries to stockpile millions of doses of antiviral medication, according to the second report. A spokesman for the WHO and several independent experts strongly disputed the reports, saying they misrepresented the seriousness of the pandemic and the agency's response, which was carefully formulated and necessary, given the potential threat. "The idea that we declared a pandemic when there wasn't a pandemic is both historically inaccurate and downright irresponsible," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said in a telephone interview. To insinuate that this was not a pandemic is very disrespectful to the people who died from it." The first report, released in Paris, came from the Social, Health and Family Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which launched an investigation in response to allegations that the WHO's reaction to the swine flu pandemic was influenced by drug companies that make antiviral drugs and vaccines. The second report, a joint investigation by the BMJ, a prominent British medical journal, and the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, criticized the WHO's 2004 guidelines, which were developed based in part on the advice of three experts who received consulting fees from the two leading manufacturers of antiviral drugs used against the virus, Roche and GlaxoSmithKline. The British Medical Journal says the scientists had openly declared these interests in other publications yet WHO made no mention of the links.

REUTERS/LBJ Library Photo by Frank Wolfe/Handout WASHINGTON Veteran White House journalist Helen Thomas, who has covered every president since John F. Kennedy, abruptly retired on Monday amid a storm of criticism over her controversial remarks about Israel. The departure of Thomas, 89, as a Hearst Newspapers columnist was announced after she was captured on video saying Israelis should "get the hell out of Palestine" and suggesting they go "home" to Germany, Poland or the United States. The controversy prompted Thomas to be dropped by her public speaking agency and also led to the cancellation of her plans to deliver a high school commencement address in suburban Washington. "Helen Thomas announced Monday that she is retiring, effective immediately," Hearst News Service reported. Thomas was absent from Monday's White House briefing, where she has a reserved seat in the center of the front row. The White House Correspondents Association called her remarks "indefensible" and, before the announcement of her retirement, scheduled a meeting on whether an opinion columnist should have a front-row seat in the West Wing briefing room.

Rescue underway for teen solo sailor
Sailor's parents unswayed by critics The Sutherlands say Abby's skills, not age, are key. Experts see a mix of factors at work, including the culture's ambivalence about teenagers. An article in Saturday's Section A about the parents of teen sailor Abby Sunderland and their response to critics of her attempt to sail around the world referred to the family, in a subheadline, as the Sutherlands. "Age is not a criteria. Abby is a fine sailor," he added. "If people are looking at age, they're looking at the wrong thing here," Laurence Sunderland told reporters Friday outside the family's home in Thousand Oaks as a rescue ship headed to where Abby Sunderland had been spotted the night before, adrift in her damaged boat in the southern Indian Ocean. To the legions of critics who have questioned why they allowed their 16-year-old daughter to sail solo around the world, Laurence and Marianne Sunderland offered no apologies Friday. In an era when social scientists worry about "helicopter parents" hovering over their offspring, shielding them from dangers real and invented, the saga of the globe-circling, teenage solo sailor presents a dramatic counterpoint. Abby set sail from Marina del Rey on Jan. 23 and was roughly halfway through her attempted round-the-world solo sail when her 40-foot boat, Wild Eyes, apparently lost a mast in rough seas. Her family lost contact with her early Thursday morning, and many feared the worst until she was located by an Australian spotter jet late Thursday night. From the moment that the teenage skipper was reported missing, debate over her parents' decision to permit the risky adventure has boiled on blogs and among child-rearing experts.

Women reveal accounts of forced abortion in Scientology
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's campaign is out with a new ad criticizing his Republican opponent in the Nevada Senate race, Sharron Angle, for advocating a phase-out of Social Security and Medicare. In it, a narrator says that Social Security means "independence" and "a secure income" - and that Angle "shockingly" wants to wipe the program out. "She'd cut benefits for everyone coming into the system," the narrator says. The spot also touches on Angle's reported onetime support for "championing a program there that was developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard" that uses saunas and massages in prisons. As Jon Ralston notes (via Politico's Ben Smith), Angle was on Fox News this morning, where she called the notion that she wants to get rid of Social Security "nonsense" despite her calls for it to be phased out. (She also claimed Reid "waterboarded" the economy.) "I have always said we need to make the lockbox a lockbox, put the money in there for our senior citizens," she said. "They came here in good faith paying into a system and Harry Reid has put an IOU in for 24 years. What we need to do is personalize Social Security so the government can no longer raid it." Angle has previously called Social Security "a broken system without much to recommend it." Reid is relatively unpopular in Nevada, with an approval rating hovering around just 40 percent; his electoral strategy is predicated in large part on convincing Nevada voters that while they may not love him, they don't really have a better option. By virtue of her controversial positions, Angle is believed to be the sort of candidate against whom Reid could successfully executive such a strategy and achieve an unlikely reelection victory.

Bomb left outside police station in Northern Ireland
Hundreds of people evacuated in Aughnacloy, County Tyrone, after 300lb bomb left in van outside local police station A 300lb bomb was left in a van outside a border police station in Northern Ireland last night, police confirmed today. Hundreds of people living near the police station in Aughnacloy, County Tyrone, were evacuated. Dissident republicans using a recognised codeword phoned a Belfast newsroom last night warning that a bomb had been placed in the van. Army bomb experts have been examining the white vehicle overnight. A police spokesman said about 350 residents including children spent the night in three community halls during the security alert. The main street in Aughnacloy is only partially open and the A5 road linking Derry to the Republic is accessible, although the Aughnacloy to Dungannon road is closed. Dissidents have been responsible for several bomb attacks on police stations and other buildings across Northern Ireland in recent months. Local Democratic Unionist councillor Sammy Brush said: "There is nothing getting in, or out, of the vicinity of the police station. There's a white Ford Transit van parked in front of the police station. Had it gone off, it would have caused serious destruction and death."

Sweden's Crown Princess marries long-time boyfriend
Sweden has celebrated a royal wedding between Crown Princess Victoria and her former fitness trainer. Victoria, 32, tied the knot with 36-year-old commoner Daniel Westling. More than 1,200 guests, including royals from around the world, attended the lavish ceremony in Stockholm Cathedral. The couple, who met in 2002, later rode through the capital in a horse-drawn carriage as tens of thousands of people lined the streets. Victoria was escorted down the aisle by her father. She is first in line to succeed him. After exchanging vows, the couple took to the same royal barge that Victoria's parents, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, used on their wedding day exactly 34 years ago. The newlyweds were transported to the Royal Palace, for an evening banquet with guests from around the world. Sweden's monarchy has no political power, but the king or queen represents the nation and greets foreign dignitaries. The plot of one of Europe's most high-profile royal relationships will reach its denouement tomorrow when Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria marries fitness trainer Daniel Westling.

US Senator Robert Byrd dies at age 92
Washington (CNN) -- West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, the self-educated son of a coal miner who became the longest-serving member of Congress, died early Monday at age 92, the senator's office said. Byrd, a nine-term Democrat, was known as a master of the chamber's often-arcane rules and as the self-proclaimed "champion of the Constitution," a jealous guardian of congressional power. His speeches were laced with references to poetry and the Greek and Roman classics, often punctuated by the brandishing of his pocket copy of the national charter. He was also known as the "King of Pork," using top positions on the Senate Appropriations Committee to steer federal spending to his home state -- one of the nation's poorest. "Pork, to the critic, is service to the people who enjoy some of the good things in life, and I've been happy to bring to West Virginia the projects to which they refer. I have no apology for it," he said. He was an outspoken opponent of the war in Iraq, calling his 2002 vote against a "blind and improvident" authorization of military action the proudest moment of his career. Joe Manchin -- a Democrat -- has the power to appoint a replacement for Byrd, whose current term is set to expire in 2013. When Byrd entered Congress in January 1953, a postage stamp cost 3 cents and American kids were clamoring for a new toy called Mr.

Eleven alleged Russian spies arrested in US
Ten alleged members of a Russian spy-ring have been charged in the US with acting as foreign agents. The suspects are accused of posing as ordinary citizens, some living together as couples for years. They were charged with conspiracy to act as unlawful agents of a foreign government, a crime which carries up to five years in prison. There are a lot of contradictions," spokesman Igor Lyakin-Frolov told the AFP news agency, declining further comment. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov later said Moscow expected Washington to provide an explanation over the the spying row, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. Nine of the alleged spies also face a charge of conspiracy to launder money, which carries a 20-year prison sentence. While the incident does not look good for the Russians, the initial US reaction has been sanguine. Russian spy stories may be a throwback to the Cold War and sound alarming but they probably don't surprise anyone in Washington, especially not in the government. US officials who travel to Moscow routinely turn off their BlackBerries and leave them on the plane to make sure data on their phones remains out of reach of any tech-savvy Russian intelligence agents.

Three arrested in al-Qaeda bomb plot
OSLO (AP)  Three suspected al-Qaeda members were arrested Thursday for what Norwegian and U.S. officials said was a terrorist plot linked to similar plans to bomb New York's subway and blow up a shopping mall in England. Officials believe the men were planning attacks with portable but powerful bombs like the ones at the heart of last year's failed suicide attack in the New York City subway, an attack U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has called one of the most serious plots since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. On Wednesday, U.S. prosecutors revealed the existence of a related plot in Manchester, England. The plots underscore al-Qaeda's interest in smaller-level attacks that don't require the intricate planning and coordination of Sept. 11, in which airplanes were hijacked and flown into the World Trade Center towers in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington, Va. And they follow a trend in which the terrorist group has used operatives inside potential target countries, rather than trying to sneak people across increasingly secure borders. The three men, whose names were not released, had been under surveillance for more than a year. Officials would not say what country or site was the target of the latest terror threat, or even whether they believed the men had selected a target. Those arrested in Norway included a 39-year-old Norwegian of Uighur origin who has lived in the country since 1999 and a 31-year-old citizen of Uzbekistan who had a permanent Norwegian residency permit, said Janne Kristiansen, head of Norway's Police Security Service. The man arrested in Germany is a 37-year-old Iraqi with a Norwegian residency permit, Kristiansen said. Kristiansen did not say exactly where the arrests took place but said all three men "had connections to Oslo." al-Qaeda usually keeps its plots compartmentalized, and officials do not believe the suspects in Norway knew about the other plots.

CNN journalist fired for controversial Twitter message
CNN International has fired one of its senior editors after she published a Twitter message lamenting the death of a Lebanese Shi'ite cleric. The above tweet by Octavia Nasr referred to the Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, an early mentor of the militant group Hezbollah who died in Beirut on Sunday. Nasr, a 20-year CNN veteran based in Atlanta, departed from the channel after "a conversation" with Parisa Khosravi, a CNN senior vice president. The channel was reported by the New York Times to have been alerted to the tweet by some supporters of Israel. Fadlallah was also the spiritual leader of Hezbollah when it was formed after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, though he later distanced himself from its ties with Iran. Nasr is quoted in a BBC report as calling her tweet "an error of judgment". She said she had been referring to Fadlallah's "pioneering" views on women's rights. She said in a blog posting: "Reaction to my tweet was immediate, overwhelming and provides a good lesson on why 140 characters should not be used to comment on controversial or sensitive issues, especially those dealing with the Middle East." CNN on Wednesday removed its senior editor for Middle Eastern affairs, Octavia Nasr, from her job after she published a Twitter message saying that she respected the Shiite cleric the Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, who died on Sunday. Parisa Khosravi, the senior vice president for CNN International Newsgathering, said in an internal memorandum that she “had a conversation” with Ms. Nasr on Wednesday morning and that “we have decided that she will be leaving the company.” Ms. Nasr, a 20-year veteran of CNN, wrote on Twitter after the cleric died on Sunday, “Sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah … One of Hezbollah’s giants I respect a lot.” Ayatollah Fadlallah routinely denounced Israel and the United States, and supported suicide bombings against Israeli civilians.

British snooker player Alex Higgins found dead at age 61
Alex Higgins, the legendary two-times world snooker champion known as much for his wild lifestyle as his flamboyant play on the green baize, died yesterday aged 61. His skill and speed around the table earned him one of sport's most enduring nicknames: the Hurricane. A world champion by the age of 22, he played a major role in snooker's booming popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, when players were household names. Higgins became one of the fans' favourite players. His second world title win, in 1982 when he beat the Welshman Ray Reardon in an 18-15 final, is one of the sport's best-remembered matches. Belfast-born Higgins regularly courted controversy. Another time, he headbutted an official, resulting in a fine and a five-tournament ban. It is estimated that he earned, and mostly spent, £3m over 20 years. But to the wider public he was a breath of fresh air that drew them into the game.

Enlarge By Aamir Qureshi, AFP/Getty Images Fire and smoke rise from the wreckage of a passenger plane in the Margalla Hills on the outskirts of Islamabad on Wednesday. ISLAMABAD (AP)  A passenger jet that officials suspect veered off course in monsoon rains and thick clouds crashed into hills overlooking Pakistan 's capital, killing all 152 people on board and scattering body parts and twisted metal far and wide. The Airblue jet's crash Wednesday was the deadliest ever in Pakistan, and just the latest tragedy to jolt a country that has suffered numerous deaths in recent years due to al-Qaeda and Taliban attacks. At least two U.S. citizens were on the plane, which carried mostly Pakistanis. The plane left the southern city of Karachi at 7:45 a.m. for a two-hour flight to Islamabad and was trying to land when it lost contact with the control tower, said Pervez George, a civil aviation official. The aircraft, an Airbus A321, crashed some nine miles from the airport, scorching a wide stretch of the Margalla Hills, including a section behind Faisal Mosque, one of Islamabad's most prominent landmarks. Twisted metal wreckage hung from trees and lay scattered across the ground. The exact cause of the crash was not immediately clear, and rescue workers were seeking the "black box" flight data recorder amid the wreckage.

Bull fighting banned in Catalonia
Image caption Bullfighting has declined in popularity in Catalonia but fights are still held in Barcelona The parliament of Catalonia has voted to ban bullfighting - the first region of mainland Spain to do so. The vote took place as the result of a petition brought to parliament, signed by 180,000 people who say the practice is barbaric and outdated. Bullfight supporters insist that the corrida, as it is known, is an important tradition to preserve. They also fear the vote could be the first of many in the country. In Wednesday's vote, 68 backed a ban, 55 voted against and nine abstained. Barcelona's main bullring is one of the oldest in Spain, but support for the bullfight has waned. The Barcelona bullring is the only functioning one in Catalonia. The vote was brought to the agenda by activists who argue it is cruel and unacceptable and say most spectators in Catalonia these days are tourists.

Mr. Ahmadinejad also said those who believe in a psychic octopus cannot be leaders of nations like Iran "that aspire to human perfection." Iran's state-run media said the president discussed the octopus during a speech to a youth festival in Tehran on Friday. The eight-legged sea creature picked the outcome of this year's World Cup matches in South Africa by choosing to eat from a box of mussels labeled with the flag of the winning team. Paul correctly predicted the winner of all seven of Germany's matches. He claims that the octopus is a symbol of decadence and decay among "his enemies". He became an international star after predicting the outcome of all seven German World Cup matches accurately.

French woman admits to killing her eight infants
French prosecutors have charged a woman in her 40s with murder, saying she confessed to killing her eight newborn babies and burying their remains. Prosecutors say Dominique Cottrez did not want any more children and did not want to visit a doctor for contraception. Her husband was apparently unaware his wife had given birth eight times and killed the children. French officials describe Cottrez as a heavy-set woman and say it was easy for her to conceal her pregnancies. The new owners of Cottrez's parents' house found two of the corpses buried in the ground in plastic bags. This led police to Cottrez's current house, where they found six more bodies hidden in the garage. A picture taken from the Facebook page allegedly shows Dominique Cottrez, who was charged with the "deliberate homicides of minors under the age of 15". (Xinhua/AFP Photo) Dominique Cortez, the mother murderer, admitted that she stifled voluntarily eight of her infants and hid their corpses in her ex-house in the northern village of Villers-au-Tertre, local prosecutors said. The mother confessed that she did not want to have babies anymore and refused to see a doctor to get contraception, the prosecutors told local reporters, calling it "a non-standard case given the large number of newborns." The 45-year-old mother of two girls, arrested on charges of deliberating offense against children under 15, is facing a sentence of life imprisonment.

Prosecutors drop assault case against former US VP Gore
Image caption Mr Gore denies any assault took place during a massage by Molly Hagerty Former US Vice-President Al Gore will not face charges over allegations he groped and assaulted a masseuse in his hotel room in Portland, Oregon, in 2006, law enforcement officials say. The authorities say there is "a lack of credible evidence" and the claims do not warrant a criminal prosecution. The decision comes a month after police reopened the investigation. Mr Gore does not dispute that he had a massage from Molly Hagerty, 54, but denies any assault took place. The case, which was closed previously because of a lack of evidence, was reopened in June after Ms Haggerty told the National Enquirer magazine that Mr Gore had tried to assault her. Having reopened the case, prosecutors reportedly chose not to pursue it because Ms Hagerty had refused a polygraph test and appeared to have been paid by the magazine. Mr Gore was in Portland to deliver a speech on climate change when the massage in question took place. Official says masseuse and her attorneys were uncooperative, and witnesses could not remember anything unusual Former vice president Al Gore has been cleared of allegations that he groped and assaulted a masseuse in a Portland hotel room in 2006. After a four-week investigation that included interviews with Gore, the masseuse, her acquaintances and hotel staff, authorities said there was no basis for prosecution. Rees also said the masseuse and her attorneys were uncooperative, witnesses could not remember anything unusual, and that the masseuse failed a polygraph examination and would not say whether she was paid by a tabloid newspaper for her story.

In a statement released to confirm that the wedding had taken place on Saturday evening, Bill and Hillary Clinton said: "We could not have asked for a more perfect day to celebrate the beginning of their life together, and we are so happy to welcome Marc into our family. "On behalf of the newlyweds, we want to give special thanks to the people of Rhinebeck for welcoming us and to everyone for their well-wishes on this special day." Earlier, actors Ted Danson and his wife Mary Steenburgen told reporters in the town of Rhinebeck, where many of those invited are staying, that they were both excited about attending the ceremony. "I knew her since she was a baby so this is a big moment," Steenburgen said. Shopkeepers, innkeepers, retailers and caterers in Rhinebeck have been sworn to secrecy about the event and inconvenienced local residents have been offered complimentary bottles of wine.

Three children die in Edinburgh house fire
Image caption The dead children have been named as Luca, Austin and Cecilia Riggi Police in Edinburgh are continuing the forensic examination of a flat in which three children were discovered dead. Eight-year-old twins Luca and Austin Riggi and their sister Cecilia, five, were found after a reported gas explosion and fire at the Slateford Road property. Their mother Theresa was hurt when she fell from the townhouse-style building. Police are treating the deaths as suspicious and plan to speak to Mrs Riggi, 46, when she is well enough. It is understood the three youngsters did not die as a result of Wednesday afternoon's suspected explosion and small blaze. Post-mortem examinations are due to be carried out on the children, who were at the centre of a custody battle between their US-born parents, Mrs Riggi and her husband Pasquale. Police have said the results of the post-mortems would help them determine whether to launch a murder inquiry. Det Supt Allan Jones said it was too early to determine the children's cause of death. He explained that Mrs Riggi and her children had been traced to the Edinburgh address after they were reported missing from the family home in Skene, Aberdeenshire, at the beginning of July. Mr Jones added: "The family had been in the city for a few weeks and we are keen to speak to anyone who knew them during that time. "We are not in a position to speak to the woman yet and we will take advice from her doctors as to when that can happen. "We would like to do that to get a true background to the events of yesterday and find out exactly what happened within the house." Image caption Mrs Riggi had been reported missing from her Aberdeenshire home last month The children's father has been interviewed by police in Aberdeen, but is said not to be a suspect.

Spreading floods in Pakistan worsen, at least 1600 dead
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption "People say they are not getting help from the army or the government" The worst flooding in Pakistan's history has now affected more than four million people and left at least 1,600 dead, says the UN. While floods in the north-west began to recede, the vast body of water has been moving down the country into new parts of Punjab and menacing Sindh province. All wells have been contaminated and water-borne diseases are spreading, officials say. The region is midway through monsoon season and more rain is forecast. The number of affected districts in Punjab has reached seven, while 350,000 people have been moved from neighbouring Sindh province, most of which is on high alert, the United Nations said. Manuel Bessler, who heads the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Pakistan, told a news conference in Geneva: "What we are facing now is a major catastrophe." He added: "We are only in the middle of the monsoon season, there is more rain expected. Treetops visible In Punjab, known as Pakistan's "breadbasket" for its rich agriculture, more than 1,300 villages have been affected and at least 25,000 homes destroyed, said disaster relief officials in the province. At the scene We witnessed chaotic and frenzied scenes at a camp for about 1,000 displaced people in this north-western town. A single truck arrived at the camp carrying bottled water and biscuits - a private donation from a local politician. From old ladies to children, the people clambered over the truck grabbing what they could in the blazing heat.

US Senate confirms Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan
Enlarge By Jack Gruber, USA TODAY Elena Kagan prepares to testify on the second day of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington on June 29. WASHINGTON  Chief Justice John Roberts will swear in Elena Kagan as the nation's 112th Supreme Court justice on Saturday, making women one-third of the nation's highest court for the first time in history. Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Roberts telephoned Kagan to offer "warm congratulations" Thursday, shortly after the Senate confirmed her. The 63-37 vote was a victory for President Obama, who has doubled the number of women ever named to the Supreme Court with his first two nominees. "I am confident that Elena Kagan will make an outstanding Supreme Court justice," Obama said in Chicago, where he was traveling. "And I am proud, also, of the history we're making with her appointment." Kagan, 50, was the first woman to serve as U.S. solicitor general and the first female dean of Harvard Law School. When the court reconvenes on the first Monday in October, Kagan will join Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor as the first trio of women serving together as justices. DESPITE PARTISAN SWATS: Kagan's path to bench clear Five Republican senators broke ranks with their party to support Kagan's nomination: Richard Lugar of Indiana; Judd Gregg of New Hampshire; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; and Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine. In Kagan, the president has appointed "someone who shares his progressive, elitist vision and is willing to advance it from the bench," warned Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is the Judiciary Committee's top Republican.

A ceremony has been held to mark 65 years since the atomic bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Representatives from 75 nations - including the United States, which dropped the bomb - were among thousands who gathered to remember the moment that changed the world. A bell was rung at the precise moment the nuclear bomb 'Little Boy' was dropped by a US plane - just after 0800 on August 6, 1945. Around 140,000 people died, some instantly, others later from the effects of the radiation. (CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon used an appearance at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial ceremony in Japan to advocate for his five-point plan for worldwide nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. August 6 marks the 65th anniversary of the atomic bomb dropped by the United States at the end of World War II on Hiroshima. "Together, we are on a journey from ground zero to global zero -- a world free of weapons of mass destruction," Ban said. "That is the only sane path to a safer world. For as long as nuclear weapons exist, we will live under a nuclear shadow."

Apple executive leaves company after iPhone 4 antenna issues
The Apple Inc. executive in charge of the iPhone has left the company following a string of stumbles with the device, and what people familiar with the situation said was a falling out with Chief Executive Steve Jobs. Mark Papermaster, Apple's senior vice president for mobile devices, has left the Cupertino, Calif., company, an Apple spokesman said Saturday, declining to provide further details. SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Mark Papermaster, the Apple executive in charge of iPhone engineering, has left the company weeks after the "Antennagate" controversy over complaints of poor reception on the company's latest smartphone. Apple spokesman Steve Dowling confirmed Papermaster's exit and said Bob Mansfield is assuming his responsibilities. Dowling declined to provide a reason for the departure of the former IBM senior executive. Apple released the iPhone 4 in June and it was an instant hit with consumers. But reports spread about bad reception when the device was held a certain way, and analysts warned that the company's reputation for quality was under threat. The issue snowballed into a publicity crisis and Apple was forced to call a press conference to tackle the matter. Apple CEO Steve Jobs maintained there was nothing wrong with the iPhone 4, and that the reception problem was one shared by other smartphones. "Mr. Mansfield already manages groups that create many of the key technologies for the iPhone and iPod touch, including the A4 chip, Retina display and touch screens," Dowling said.

Flash floods kill over a hundred in India, 500 missing
CHOGLUMSAR (Leh): Rescue workers struggled through piles of mud and slush looking for over 500 people missing in the Friday's devastating cloudburst that flattened villages and snapped power and communication links even as the death toll in the tragedy on Sunday mounted to 145.The once picturesque landscape has turned into a disaster zone, with tossed up vehicles lying scattered and mounds of silt and slush burying houses made of mud called 'gomfa' and shops.Walking on the layers of unstable mud in one of the worst-hit Choglusmar village, you could find the high tension wires hanging right next to you.Rescuers waded through knee-deep mud to extricate trapped people. Jawans of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Army and General Reserve Engineer Force (GREF) ploughed through the silt and boulders with earth movers, cranes and other machines, tourists were seen giving a helping hand.The death toll has climbed to 145 while over 500 were still to be accounted for after the cloudburst and flash floods, official sources said.Both the ITBP and the Army have set up various camps to look after hundreds of injured. The ITBP had also set up community kitchens along the roads which are feeding the homeless.The biggest roadblock that rescue workers are facing is communication breakdown as the BSNL office was severely damaged in the deluge. "The major problem is due to the communication breakdown. If communication is restored it will help in co-ordination of rescue operations in a better way," Pashi Tsetan, deputy director with the development wing of the local administration, said.The district hospital building had been inundated by the swirling waters forcing the administration to move to an under-construction building.Hundreds of people with bandages crowd the building. The effort of all agencies is to rescue the maximum number of people," said ITBP DIG P K Dhasmana who is leading hundreds of rescuers.As many as 1,314 passengers, mostly Indian and foreign tourists, were airlifted from Leh and brought to Delhi, aviation ministry sources said.JET airways and Air India operated four flights each and Kingfisher three to carry medical and other relief material, doctrors and para medics to help affected people in Leh, they said.Three IL-76 and four AN-32 aircraft carrying relief material reached Leh on Sunday morning. "We have recovered 145 bodies so far while the number of missing is around 500," an official said, adding the toll may go up.ITBP is helping plug the breaches to make NH-1A between Srinagar-Kargil and Kargil-Leh functionalFaced with an acute shortage of clean drinking water, the ITBP has dispatched tankers containing drinking water to the affected areas, Deepak Pandey spokesperson for the border guarding force said.The force has also established a medical camp in Saboo village, which is located above Chuglumsar village, Pandey said.Bodies of eleven persons were on Sunday flown in an IAF plane to Udhampur in Jammu region from where they were sent to Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan, police said. NEW DELHI: Amid the mounting death and debris of Choglamsar village -- located 5 km from Leh and a bustling settlement of Ladakhis and Tibetan refugees -- that has borne the major burnt in the massive mudslide sparked by Friday's cloudburst, comes stories of miraculous escapes bordering on divine intervention.According to sources in Leh that ToI was able to contact through defence sources, the wife of an Indo-Tibet Border Police officer was found alive after being swept away by the slithering mass of mud. She was found under the furniture that saved her from being smothered.Sources said the situation could have been worse but for the rumbling of the slithering mass of mud -- akin to cold lava -- and screams of people warning people in the defence settlements dotting the plains. Many in the defence establishment managed to escape nature's wrath since the slithering mass of mud did not gush like a stream of water, and the preceding rumbling gave some precious time to the people in the lower reaches to beat an hasty retreat.Sources expected the Leh-Manali road to be opened in a couple of days as heavy earth-moving equipment, called JCB bythe defence establishment, have been pressed into service.

Mia Farrow, Carole White testify in Charles Taylor's war crimes trial
She told the court at The Hague that supermodel Naomi Campbell claimed in1997 to have been given a large diamond by Mr. Taylor after a dinner party hosted by Nelson Mandela. However, Farrow's testimony contradicts Campbell's own evidence given last week. The court questioned actress Mia Farrow about the events surrounding a dinner party hosted by Nelson Mandela in 1997. The morning after the party, she said, fellow guest Naomi Campbell told her that Charles Taylor had sent her a diamond in the night. "She (Naomi Campbell) said that in the night she had been awakened, some men were knocking at the door, and they had been sent by Charles Taylor, and they had given her a huge diamond," Mia Farrow said. She told the court that Mr. Taylor had promised Campbell the diamonds over dinner. Both White and Farrow contradicted what Naomi Campbell told the court last week. She said she had been given what she called "a few dirty pebbles" in the middle of the night. And she stopped short of saying she had known they were from Mr. Taylor. They say the gift given to Campbell links him to these so-called "blood diamonds".

Wikinews obtains new details on UK prisoner's murder
The Prison Officers' Association has called for an investigation into the murder of an inmate at Grendon prison, claiming that government cuts are jeopardising the Buckinghamshire jail's ability to treat some of the penal system's most difficult prisoners. It emerged today that Robert Coello, a 44-year-old former bus driver who was serving a sentence for sexually assaulting a minor, died on Sunday night after being attacked in his cell by a fellow inmate. It is thought to be the first murder in Grendon's 48-year history. The jail, which was opened in 1962 as an experimental psychiatric prison to treat prisoners with antisocial personality disorders, houses a population which includes murderers and sex offenders. The prison is run as a "therapeutic community" which aims "to help prisoners develop more positive relationships, to change how they relate to others and to reduce their risk of reoffending". Colin Moses, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, said budget cuts may have affected the vetting system that ensures only those prisoners best suited to Grendon are allowed in. "Grendon has been a very well run prison," he said. "It has had an excellent record of dealing with some of the most difficult prisoners in very difficult circumstances.

US food regulators recall 380 million eggs after salmonella outbreak
Government officials say that the number of people sickened by an outbreak of salmonella poisoning from eggs is likely to rise because officials fear that many of the contaminated eggs are still in peoples' refigerators. The salmonella outbreak has triggered a massive recall of eggs and sickened about 2,000 people, and many more cases are expected to be reported. "With the fact that contaminated eggs could still be in consumers' refrigerators, this outbreak could really be one of the largest linked to eggs that we've seen in 20 years," Caroline Smith DeWall of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said. Play The number of recalled eggs by an Iowa Farm has skyrocketed to 380 million eggs, up from 228 million eggs on Wednesday. The recall includes eggs that were packed right up until two days ago. "There are preventative measures that woulld have been in place that could have prevented this if they had been in place more fully," said Sherri McGarry of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. McCarry said that "one area we are closely looking at and examining" is whether rodents had gotten into the chicken houses. Rodents, she said, "tend to run in the feed troughs.... if they're not well maintained. The eggs that are believed to be tainted were sold under the following brand names: Lucerne, Mountain Dairy, Sunshine, Hillandale, Trafficanda, Albertson, Farm Fresh, Shoreland, James Farms, Glenview, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma's, Lund, Dutch Farms, Kemps and Pacific Coast. You can tell if you have a recalled package of eggs by looking at the Julian dates and plant code stamped on the end of the egg carton or on the case label. The Julian dates range from 136 to 229 with plant numbers 1026, 1413, 1942 and 1946.

Seven killed in Chinese bombing
SHANGHAI — An explosion killed 7 people and wounded 14 others on Thursday in China’s restive far western region of Xinjiang, the site of deadly ethnic riots last year. The blast took place about 10:30 a.m. when an electric three-wheeled vehicle exploded on a bridge on the outskirts of Aksu, a city in northwestern Xinjiang, according to China’s state-run news agency, Xinhua. Most of those wounded were ethnic minorities. Hou Hanmin, a spokeswoman for the government of Xinjiang, said the “name and age of the male suspect are unknown yet.” Aksu is on China’s fabled Silk Road, about 404 miles from Urumqi, the region’s capital, and about 40 miles from China’s border with Kyrgyzstan. Xinjiang has been tense since the summer of 2009, when rioting broke out between the region’s ethnic Uighurs, who are native to the area, and Han Chinese, who have grown in numbers because of government resettlement programs. The rioting left 197 people dead and more than 1,700 injured, most of them Han, according to the government. "Police say it was an intentional act because the suspect was carrying explosive devices,'' Hou Hanmin, a spokeswoman for the Xinjiang government, said. Intentions unclear Melissa Chan, Al Jazeera's correspondent in the regional capital, Urumqi, said: "It could well have been that this small vehicle was carrying some flammable liquid and that it could have been an accident. "The other thing that we are getting is that all of the dead and injured are ethnic minorities.

Federal Aviation Administration proposes US$24.2m fine against American Airlines
The fine reflects a more aggressive stance by the F.A.A., which has been criticized for being lax on some maintenance issues, particularly surrounding American Airlines and a separate case involving Southwest Airlines. The transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, said in a statement, “We expect operators to perform inspections and conduct regular and required maintenance.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The F.A.A. said American failed to follow an agency order, called an Airworthiness Directive, dating from 2006, that required airlines to inspect how some wires were bundled on the wheel wells of their McDonnell Douglas MD-80 planes. The agency said that chafing on the wires might spark a fire or cause an explosion because of the wires’ proximity to hydraulic fluids or the fuel tanks. Shortly after a 2008 deadline, the F.A.A. said it detected violations at American on 10 MD-80s during inspections at the airline’s hub in Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and its maintenance center in Tulsa, Okla.

Race to save Chilean miners trapped underground from spiralling into depression continues
33 men entombed in collapsed San Jose mine are given just 30 seconds each to speak to their wives, children and parents The 33 Chilean miners trapped deep underground have spoken for the first time to family members waiting for them on the surface. The brief phone conversations late yesterday brought a measure of reassurance to families who have grown increasingly worried about the ability of the men to survive the estimated three months of the rescue operation. Engineers at the mine in Chile's Atacama desert are awaiting for drilling parts from Germany to begin the initial digging of what is expected to be the main rescue shaft. "The families have had the chance to communicate by telephone with them, so of course there have been moments of great emotion," said Ximena Matas, the governor of the Atacama region. She said the families "listened with great interest and they both felt and realised that the men are well. Family members received the first of what are intended to be daily phone calls in a cabin set up alongside one of the three boreholes now connecting the miners with the surface. Portions of the conversations were made public, including the promise by miner Esteban Rojas that he would marry his girlfriend of 25 years upon his rescue from the collapsed tunnel. As the phone connection is still precarious, family members were given just 20-30 seconds to say hello and send a short message to their loved one. He asked us to stay calm as everything is going to be OK. "He sounded relaxed and since it was so short I didn't manage to ask anything.

No oil spillage after platform explodes in the Gulf of Mexico
HOUSTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said on Thursday afternoon that production from a burning oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut. Jindal said operator Mariner Energy's ME.N senior officials told Louisiana officials the flow of oil from the sea floor had been stopped. The fire seen on the platform was from flammable material in storage on the platform. HOUSTON, Sept 2 The U.S. Coast Guard said a 1-nautical-mile-by-100-foot (1.85-km-by-30.5-meter) oil sheen had been reported at the site of a Mariner Energy ME.N platform in the Gulf of Mexico that was on fire Thursday after a morning explosion. The fire on board the platform located 90 miles (145 km) south of the Louisiana coast was contained as of 12 noon CDT (1700 GMT) but had not been put out, the Coast Guard said. An oil platform exploded and burned off the Louisiana coast Thursday, the second such disaster n the Gulf of Mexico in less than five months. The Coast Guard initially reported that an oil sheen a mile long and 100 feet wide had begun to spread from the site of the blast, about 200 miles west of the source of BP's massive spill. The company that owns the platform, Houston-based Mariner Energy, did not know what caused the fire. Mariner Energy's Patrick Cassidy said he considered the incident a fire, not an explosion. "The platform is still intact and it was just a small portion of the platform that appears to be burned," he said.

Basque separatist group ETA declares ceasefire
The Spanish government on Monday rejected a new ceasefire announcement by the separatist group ETA and ruled out negotiations on an independent Basque homeland, saying the militants have been decimated by arrests and are desperate to regroup and rearm. A boy walks past ETA graffiti in Mondragon, Spain on Monday. Basque rebels ETA have decided to no longer carry out armed attacks, newspaper Gara said on its website on Sunday. ((Vincent West/Reuters)) Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the ETA cannot be trusted after shattering a 2006 truce with a deadly car bombing. He said its statement Sunday by three hooded militants speaking in a video falls short of what Basque society and other Spaniards demand: that ETA renounce violence for good. "The word truce, as the idea of a limited peace to open a process of dialogue, is dead," Perez Rubalcaba, adding that Spain will be as tough as ever against ETA. "The Interior Ministry will keep its anti-terrorism policy intact, absolutely intact. We are not going to change that policy one bit, not a single comma," he told Spanish National Television. ETA has killed more than 825 people as it fought for an independent homeland in parts of northern Spain and southwestern France since the late 1960s. Its last deadly attack in Spain was in July 2009, when it killed two policemen with a car bomb. Nearly 240 of its members have been arrested since 2008. Besides silence on whether the ETA will surrender its weapons, it did not say if the truce was open-ended and permanent, like the one declared in 2006 and which led to talks with the government, or whether it would halt other activities like extorting money from business leaders or recruiting members.

Scottish FA apologise after fans boo Liechtenstein national anthem
Scotland fans booed during the Liechtenstein national anthem The Scottish Football Association has hit out at the "disgraceful" booing of the Liechtenstein national anthem. A section of Scotland fans jeered the anthem - which has the same tune as God Save The Queen - before their side's 2-1 victory in the Euro 2012 qualifier. SFA acting chief executive George Peat said he was "embarrassed" by the booing at Hampden on Tuesday. "I apologise unreservedly to our visitors for the crass reaction to their anthem," said Peat. Peat said those who chose to boo the anthem ran the risk of damaging the reputation of the Tartan Army. MY SPORT: DEBATE "The Scotland fans have worked hard to earn their reputation throughout the world as fun-loving and respectful followers of football," he added. "Last night, those who chose to boo our opponents' anthem only served to tarnish that reputation." "It must not be forgotten that all nations must abide by Fifa's Fair Play policy and last night's behaviour does nothing to help Scotland's image," he added. Scotland's victory, coupled with Lithuania's 1-0 win away to the Czech Republic, sees the Scots top Group I with four points from their opening two games. The Liechtenstein anthem, which has the same tune as God Save The Queen, was met with audible derision by some members of the Scotland support ahead of last night's match at Hampden Park, which Craig Levein's men won 2-1 courtesy of Stephen McManus' 97th-minute header. Peat said: "I was embarrassed and extremely disappointed by the disgraceful behaviour of some of our supporters during the Liechtenstein national anthem at Hampden Park last night. "Last night, those who chose to boo our opponents' anthem only served to tarnish that reputation.

BP report into Gulf of Mexico disaster lays blame on other contractors
BP rolled out the results Wednesday of a four-month internal investigation into the causes of the April 20 blowout of its Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, spreading blame among its contractors and giving a glimpse of the defenses it might deploy in public and in court. The much-anticipated report asserted that a "complex and interlinked series" of failures - of equipment, engineering and judgment - led to the surge of oil and gas that exploded on the deck of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, killing 11 people, sinking the rig and triggering the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The report was written by a team of 50 internal and external experts led by the company's head of safety and operations, Mark Bly, and the rollout Wednesday morning at a hotel in downtown Washington was labeled a "technical briefing." But the document inevitably carries a heavy public relations element as well as legal and financial implications for BP. It arrives as the Justice Department is weighing whether to bring charges of criminal negligence against BP that could sharply increase the cost of the spill for the London-based oil giant and provide fodder for private lawsuits. In addition, there is legislation in Congress that would effectively strip BP of the right to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. The company is haggling with the Obama administration over what pieces of collateral to offer while it is financing the $20 billion escrow fund that will be used to pay claims. And BP's main partner in the well, Anadarko Petroleum, has declared that it won't pay its share of the cleanup costs and claims because it views BP's well design and actions as reckless. The investigation found fault with the recipe Halliburton used in its cement, with the flaps on a Weatherford International barrier device known as a float collar, and with the condition of hydraulic lines and batteries that might have sapped power from the blowout preventer made by Cameron International and operated by Transocean, making it impossible to clamp and cut through steel piping. And Bly said BP needs to reexamine the way it oversees work by its contractors.

Up to ten reported dead, 50 injured after pipeline blast in Iran
TEHRAN (Reuters) - Up to 10 Iranian workers died on Saturday in hospital after being badly burnt in an explosion in a gas pipeline, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. The pipeline transporting gas from the Khangiran refinery in Sarakhs to the city of Mashhad in Iran's northeastern province of Khorasan-e Razavi exploded on Friday when it was accidentally struck by an excavating machine, state media reported. "About nine to 10 people were killed in the Sarakhs pipeline blast," Alireza Gharibi, director of Iran Gas Engineering and Development Company, told the semi-official Fars news agency. The explosion set off a fire covering 2 sq km (.77 sq mile) but it was brought under control, the official IRNA news agency reported. Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Javad Oji told Fars that gas transfer through the damaged Sarakhs-Mashhad pipeline will be resumed within the next 24-to-36 hours. Iran is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and also sits on the world's second largest natural gas reserves and the country's economy is heavily dependent on oil and gas revenues. Accidental rupture leaves 10 workers dead and 20 injured, as firefighters bring blaze under control after three hours. The fire caused by the accident raged for three hours before firefighters brought the blaze under control A gas pipeline explosion has killed 10 people and injured more than 20 in the city of Mashhad, northeastern Iran. The accident on Friday, set off when an earth-moving machine struck a local pipeline, ignited a large blaze in the area, the official ISNA news agency reported on Saturday. It took firefighters three hours to bring the blaze under control.

Gunman shoots doctor, then kills mother and self at Maryland hospital
A man who became distraught as he was being briefed on his mother’s condition by a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital here pulled a gun and shot the doctor on Thursday, then killed his mother and himself in her room at the medical center, the police said. The doctor, who was wounded in the abdomen, was expected to survive. The gunman, Paul W. Pardus, 50, had been listening to the surgeon around midday when he “became emotionally distraught and reacted ... and was overwhelmed by the news of his mother’s condition,” Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld III of the Baltimore police said. Mr. Pardus pulled a semiautomatic gun from his waistband and shot the doctor once, the commissioner said. He then holed up in the room in a standoff of more than two hours that led the authorities to lock down a small section of the building while allowing the rest of the sprawling medical complex to remain open. BALTIMORE (CBS/AP) Baltimore police say a lone gunman shot a doctor on the eighth floor of a Johns Hopkins Hospital building in Baltimore, was believed to have barricaded himself in a relative's hospital room. Parts of the Nelson Building, the main tower at Johns Hopkins, was put on lockdown around 11:15 a.m. Thursday, and other sections of the East Baltimore hospital campus were evacuated, after reports of shots being fired, according to The Baltimore Sun. A nurse who worked on the floor where the injured doctor was shot told the paper that the gunman was unhappy about the way his mother was being treated and had threatened to jump out of a window when the shooting occurred. "I started running," The nurse told the Sun. Baltimore police said they were setting up a tactical operation to deal with a gunman who is holed up on the eighth floor. The doctor was rushed to surgery and is expected to survive, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

Facebook Places launches in UK
The service, which allows users to check-in at restaurants, bars and shops, was launched in the US last month. Many UK users will be able to access the service today and it will roll-out to everyone in the UK over the next couple of days. Facebook Places lets users share their location in a similar fashion to popular location-based social networks such as Foursquare and Gowalla. People using the tool can see if their friends are near them at any time based on whether they have chosen to check-into their current location. Martin McNulty, general manager of Forward 3D, a search marketing specialist, said: “Facebook Places is likely to experience a slow rate of adoption among UK audiences on its launch as people try to uncover its practical value. However, as early technology adopters begin experimenting with the technology and showing others how it can be used, its growth rate is sure to rapidly increase. "Although many of the older generation are likely to be sceptical at first about the safety aspects of announcing your location to the digital world, younger and more experimental users, will be keen to get to grips with this new tool and are less likely to let fear stand in their way.” Stuart Eccles, managing partner of Made by Many, a digital consultancy, agreed saying: “Initially Facebook Places is likely to only gain a small proportion of users but then a small proportion of Facebook users is still a lot of people. However, when it starts working with large chains and local businesses to run promotions for regular customers, we’ll start to see it enter the mainstream. “Facebook’s move into the location arena was its next logical step as the big technology companies start competing to uncover the next level of profitable metadata on consumers. Michael Sharon, the product manager of Facebook places, said: “Our products are modelled on how people are already using the site… We realised people were already posting where they were and who they were with every day.” Talking at a UK press conference this morning, he said that the company had three distinct goals for Places. One, that it the tool makes it easy for people to share their location and who they are with. Two, people can use Places to find friends who are located nearby and three, the tool helps people discover new places around them.

'Poetry lost': rude rhyme rediscovered, attributed to John Milton
Image caption Milton was known for his political and religious poems A bawdy poem attributed to Paradise Lost author John Milton has been discovered by academics at Oxford University. The innuendo-filled poem, entitled An Extempore Upon A Faggot, was found in a collection of poetic anthologies. However experts are unsure of its authenticity as the hand-written ditty is in a style unlike Milton's own. It is thought the poem may have been attributed to Milton by a jealous rival to bring scandal upon him. Dr Jennifer Batt, who discovered the poem, said: "To see the name of John Milton, the great religious and political polemicist, attached to such a bawdy epigram, is extremely surprising to say the least." AN EXTEMPORE UPON A FAGGOT Have you not in a Chimney seen A Faggot which is moist and green How coyly it receives the Heat And at both ends do's weep and sweat? So fares it with a tender Maid When first upon her Back she's laid But like dry Wood th' experienced Dame Cracks and rejoices in the Flame "The poem is so out of tune with the rest of his work, that if the attribution is correct, it would prompt a major revision of our ideas about Milton. "It is likely that Milton's name was used as an attribution to bring scandal upon the poet, perhaps by a jealous contemporary," she added. The handwritten poem appears to have been signed by Milton but is written in a style utterly unlike his own, and does not tally with his status as an epic poet, polemicist and scholarly man of letters.

Man released following bomb-scare forced flight diversion, warning a possible hoax
Police detain one person after tip that Pakistan-bound aircraft travelling from Canada could have explosives aboard. The plane landed at Arlanda airport and was parked isolated from other aircraft and buildings [AFP] Swedish police have detained one person on suspicion of preparing aircraft sabotage after a Pakistan International Airlines plane was diverted to Stockholm due to a bomb alert. Police detained the suspect, described as a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, as he was evacuated from the aircraft on Saturday along with other passengers in the Swedish capital. The Pakistan-bound plane was travelling from Toronto, Canada, with 273 passengers when its pilot made an emergency landing in Sweden following a tip that a passenger was carrying explosives. "We're searching the plane with bomb technicians to see if there is something we can find but so far we haven't found anything, neither on the plane nor on the man," Stefan Radman, the police chief of operations, said. Alert from Canada  Janne Hedlund, an official with the Stockholm police, said the plane was diverted after a woman called Canadian police, saying a man on board had explosives with him. "The aircraft started in Toronto at 05:15 local time and when the aircraft was in Swedish territory, a woman called the Canadian police and said that this man could probably have a bomb on board the aircraft," he said. "She called through a payphone, so the Canadian authority don't really know who the woman is. "The aircraft is evacuated and the suspect is under control by the police authorities in Arlanda.

Southwest Airlines to purchase AirTran Airways for US$1.4 billion
(CNN) -- Fares and fees. They're what air travelers watch, and Southwest Airlines' plan to acquire fellow low-fare airline AirTran has consumers and industry watchers buzzing about how the planned merger will affect the price of travel. AirTran will be absorbed by Southwest and adopt Southwest's policies, according to details of the $1.4 billion deal announced Monday. We don't charge for bags, we have no plans to change that. We have single-class service, we have no plans to change that," said Gary Kelly, Southwest's chairman of the board, president and CEO. "It's good news for AirTran passengers ... in general because Southwest has better service than AirTran and lower fees," said George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com. "It's so good for the flying public. This is an opportunity for a discounter to have the kind of heft and national reach of the full-fare airlines," Howard said. While it's unlikely the acquisition will lead to higher fares nationwide, he expects other airlines, such as American Airlines and USAirways, to join in the wave of airline mergers that started several years ago. "But the thing is, fares can only go up so high before passengers say 'no thank you.'

WikiLeaks releases Iraq War logs
On Dec. 22, 2006, American military officials in Baghdad issued a secret warning: The Shiite militia commander who had orchestrated the kidnapping of officials from Iraq’s Ministry of Higher Education was now hatching plans to take American soldiers hostage. What made the warning especially worrying were intelligence reports saying that the Iraqi militant, Azhar al-Dulaimi, had been trained by the Middle East’s masters of the dark arts of paramilitary operations: the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran and Hezbollah, its Lebanese ally. “Dulaymi reportedly obtained his training from Hizballah operatives near Qum, Iran, who were under the supervision of Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC-QF) officers in July 2006,” the report noted, using alternative spellings of the principals involved. Read the Document » Five months later, Mr. Dulaimi was tracked down and killed in an American raid in the sprawling Shiite enclave of Sadr City in Baghdad — but not before four American soldiers had been abducted from an Iraqi headquarters in Karbala and executed in an operation that American military officials say literally bore Mr. Dulaimi’s fingerprints. Scores of documents made public by WikiLeaks, which has disclosed classified information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, provide a ground-level look — at least as seen by American units in the field and the United States’ military intelligence — at the shadow war between the United States and Iraqi militias backed by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. During the administration of President George W. Bush, critics charged that the White House had exaggerated Iran’s role to deflect criticism of its handling of the war and build support for a tough policy toward Iran, including the possibility of military action. But the field reports disclosed by WikiLeaks, which were never intended to be made public, underscore the seriousness with which Iran’s role has been seen by the American military. The political struggle between the United States and Iran to influence events in Iraq still continues as Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has sought to assemble a coalition — that would include the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr — that will allow him to remain in power.

Pentagon unable to explain 'mystery missile' video
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The vapour trail was seen not far off the coast of Los Angeles Pentagon officials say they cannot explain reports of a missile launch off the coast of California on Monday. A CBS News helicopter captured what looked like the vapour trail of a missile rising from the water about 35 miles (56 km) offshore. Some physicists said the trail was left by an aeroplane, and that on a clear day the vapour created an illusion making it appear to rise vertically. The Pentagon does not consider the incident a threat. "Right now all indications are that it was not [defence department] involvement in this launch" Pentagon spokesman Col David Lapan said. We're doing everything we can to try to figure out if anybody has any knowledge of what this event may have been." Under normal circumstances, the launch of a US missile would require several different authorisations and notifications, but none are evident. It is unclear if the suspected missile was launched from land or sea. He told CNN on Wednesday the object leaving the trail was travelling at a constant velocity and deviating in its direction, while rockets accelerate as they leave the ground and move in a straight line. One expert says he has an answer for a video that appears to show anoff the Southern California coast - there was no missile.John Pike of the security analyst group globalsecurity.org said the video shot by a news helicopter owned by KCBS is an optical illusion.Pike said the video is of an airplane heading toward the camera and the contrail is illuminated by the setting sun. He said the object can't be a rocket because it appeared to alter its course.Pentagon officials were stumped by the event, saying no one within the Department of Defense has been able to explain the contrail or where it came from.The FAA told CBS News that they ran radar replays of a large area west of Los Angeles based on media reports of the location of a possible missile launch, but they did not reveal any fast moving unidentified targets in that area. Launches are conducted from vessels and platforms on an ocean range west of Point Mugu.The North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, issued a statement jointly with the U.S. Northern Command, or NORTHCOM, saying that the contrail was not the result of a foreign military launching a missile.

Aung San Suu Kyi release orders 'signed'
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained for 15 of the past 21 years Reports from Burma say military authorities have signed an order authorising the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. But hopes she would be freed on Friday were dashed: there has been no official confirmation of a release order. A leader of her NLD party told 2,000 supporters gathered at its headquarters to go home and return on Saturday. Ms Suu Kyi has been detained for 15 of the past 21 years, and her house arrest term expires on Saturday. There has been increased police activity outside her house in Rangoon, Burma's largest city, but no formal statement from military officials. However, Ms Suu Kyi is not expected to accept a conditional release if it excludes her from political activity. The 65-year-old was originally due to be released last year, but a case involving an American who swam across Inya Lake to her home, claiming he was on a mission to save her, prompted the latest 18-month detention. At the scene All day rumours have circulated that Aung Sang Suu Kyi could soon be free, and all day the crowds outside the offices of the NLD have grown. The building is constantly watched by government intelligence agents, yet still they came, defiantly wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with the face of their icon. Then the word came that the release would not after all be today, but perhaps tomorrow, and still no official statement from the military government. He says a number of sources inside Burma have told the BBC that documents authorising Ms Suu Kyi's release have been signed.

Iraqi government approves power-sharing deal eight months after elections
Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- After eight months of bickering and political paralysis, Iraqi leaders were thought to have finally reached a power-sharing agreement Thursday for a new government, but that deal appeared to fall apart late in the day as members of the Sunni-backed Iraqiya List walked out of the parliamentary session. Jalal Talabani, sworn in late Thursday for a second term as president, delegated Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to form a government within 30 days, as mandated by the constitution. Quarreling that has typified Iraq's gridlock re-emerged during the parliamentary session, from which most members of the Sunni-backed Iraqiya bloc walked out saying that the other political blocs were not adhering to their promise to vote on the tentative power-sharing agreement, which had been reached late Wednesday. The Iraqiya List had wanted parliament to vote on that agreement before voting for a president in order to ensure guarantees that had been promised to the Sunnis were in fact delivered. In the past, politicians have made promises to Sunnis that have not materialized, resulting in a widespread lack of trust. Politicians had cobbled out a compromise Wednesday that would have left Maliki in power and created a powerful new office that was expected to be headed by his rival, former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, lawmakers said Thursday. Under the proposed deal, the three major governmental positions were to have been filled by three members of the country's largest ethnic groups -- the Shiites, the Kurds and the Sunni Arabs. But Sunnis did not consider Nujaifi to be adequate representation, and many members of the Iraqiya bloc walked out when parliament didn't accept its demand for a vote on the actual power-sharing agreement.

Somali piracy: Kenyan navy kills three, Chinese ship hijacked, British couple freed
(CNN) -- It has been just over one year since retired couple Paul and Rachel Chandler were snatched from their yacht by pirates while sailing from the Seychelles towards Tanzania. They were experienced sailors and had been at sea for the best part of three years, as documented in blogs sent from their 38-foot yacht, the Lynn Rival. "Off we go again," reads one of their earliest entries from April 2006. "Afloat at last," they declared the following May, noting that "As ever, all our pre-launching tasks have taken longer than expected. The main task was a much needed engine overhaul. After 27 years it needed a good de-rust and re-paint." An online map on the blog charts the couple's progress through the Gulf of Aden in 2008, including a stop to visit Asmara, the capital of Eritrea where they noted: "We drank cappucinos and ate seafood pasta and pizza with real prosciutto, though the salami left something to be desired and the local wine is very rough." Their trip continued across the Arabian Sea and down the coast of India, south to the Maldives then onto the Seychelles where Paul, a former civil engineer and his wife of almost 30 years, Rachel, spent Easter. Two days later, they were kidnapped by armed gunmen who demanded a ransom of $7 million which the British government refused to pay in line with long-standing policy. Paul Chandler's first contact as a hostage came a week later down a crackly phone line with Britain's ITV News. Chandler said he and his wife were taken off the yacht and were held on a container ship called the Kota Wajah.

UK students protest for second time this month
Around 10,000 students took part in marches and gatherings across the country to protest against the Coalition plan to raise tuition fees to £9,000. Demonstrators smashed the windows of a police van in Whitehall and scrawled slogans across its doors and a number of bottles sticks and eggs were thrown at a cordon of officers. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that three protestors have been arrested in London for violent disorder and theft, while a further two arrests were made during scuffles with the police in Cambridge. One policeman's arm was broken in a confrontation while another was knocked unconscious. London Ambulance Service confirmed that eight people had been injured during the demonstrations in the capital. The demonstration followed a day of action two weeks ago that saw 60 arrested and dozens injured when a riot broke out at the Conservative Party headquarters. Police are keen to avoid a repeat of the chaos that ensued on November 10 when they were caught out by the splintering of the march, organised by the National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union (UCU), that preceded the riot. Scotland Yard and the National Public Order Intelligence Unit (NPOIU) have been monitoring information to anticipate the latest protests. Marches have been organised across England and Wales, with school and college students joining the action. Police clashed with demonstrators in Warwick and Sheffield while protests were also held in dozens of other cities including Birmingham and Newcastle. Freddie Winter, 19, from Wandsworth, south west London, studying at Lansdowne College, said: ''I was at Millbank and it got overtaken by the violence.

Korean Peninsula on the 'brink of war': DPRK
PYONGYANG, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Wednesday denounced artillery fire by South Korea as a deterioration of the north-south relations, the official news agency KCNA reported. The Central Committee of the Red Cross Society of the DPRK issued a statement on Wednesday, accusing South Korea of "derailing the process for improving the inter-Korean relations, scuttling the inter-Korean Red Cross talks and driving the situation to the brink of war by pursuing its policy of confrontation with the DPRK." Besides, the Red Cross of South Korea should be responsible for having "scuttled such humanitarian undertakings as the normalization of the reunion of separated families and relatives," as it is "a waiting maid" of the South Korean authorities, declaring the indefinite postponement of the talks. South Korea's anti-reunification acts are intolerable, as it vitiated the atmosphere for improving the inter-Korean relations and drove the situation to the "brink of war," the statement said. The "traitors will never be able to escape severer punishment by the nation," the statement said. According to the KCNA, South Korea fired toward the waters of the DPRK with dozens of shells around Yonphyong Islet in the west coast at 1:00 p.m. local time on Tuesday. The DPRK's army immediately fired back against South Korea's military provocation with determined military measures, said the report. The Supreme Command of Korean People's Army (KPA) of the DPRK issued a statement on Tuesday, warning the south side that the DPRK will take merciless military counter-actions against it without any hesitation if South Korea dared to intrude into the waters of the DPRK. It is reported that a military exercise named "Hoguk" was being held by South Korea in the nearby waters from Nov. 22 to Nov. 30. Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Hours after North Korea's deadly artillery attacks Tuesday, South Korea's president said "enormous retaliation" is needed to stop Pyongyang's incitement, but international diplomats urgently appealed for restraint.

The A380 is travelling from Sydney to Singapore, and then London, three weeks after the Australian airline grounded its flights following the incident. Qantas says the aircraft have undergone extensive work and are safe to fly. The pilots of the 4 November flight made a successful emergency landing in Singapore. The plane experienced a midair explosion shortly after taking off, in what was considered to be the most serious safety incident yet for the superjumbo. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, who was among the 478 passengers on Saturday's flight, told reporters that the planes were now safe to fly. If we weren't, we wouldn't be restarting the operations today," he said.

Tony Blair debates religion with Christopher Hitchens in Canada
Christopher Hitchens walked on stage with the evidence of his cancer plain for the world to see. His dark suit jacket hung off a much-reduced frame and his head – now devoid of hair due to chemotherapy – shone under the arc lights. He shuffled slowly to the white chair and sat down, occasionally sipping from a plastic bottle of water. But if Hitchens, who knows that his cancer of the oesophagus will probably be fatal, is preparing to meet his maker, it was not apparent. Not that anyone would expect anything else from one of the world's most prominent atheists. "Religion is a real danger to the survival of civilisation… it will be the death of us all, the end of humanity," he declared. Hitchens was on stage in Toronto to take on Tony Blair and debate whether or not religion is a force for good in the world. Hitchens, author of the uncompromisingly titled book God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything, was not. He compared the Almighty to "a kind of divine North Korea" with arbitrary rules and a hatred of freedom and rationality. "Redemption is promised at the low price of your critical faculties," he said.

Pentagon 'don't ask don't tell' poll shows support for repeal
Campaigners for gay people to be allowed to serve openly in the US military received a huge boost today when a Pentagon survey of service members found morale would not suffer from reform. The Pentagon report, published today, anticipated only isolated incidents of opposition. The defence secretary, Robert Gates, at a press conference, said the survey was not a poll on the issue but to determine the impact of changing the law. He said the survey showed reform "would not be the wrenching, traumatic change many had feared" but he identified a major stumbling block, namely the higher levels of opposition among combat units, in particular the Marines, and said this was a matter for concern among military chiefs at a time when fighting two wars. Gates recommended the Senate support legislation to end the existing policy. "It can be done and should be done," he said, warning that it needed to be done with care, to avoid disruption to those "at the tip of the spear". The fate of the proposed legislation hangs in the balance, with reformers not yet having the necessary 60 votes to pass through the 100-member Senate before Christmas. Campaigners hope the Pentagon report, which they hailed as historic and positive, would help persuade undecided senators, mainly Republicans but also a couple of Democrats. But the Republican senator, John McCain, one of the leaders of opposition, said there was a need for more scrutiny before making such a change while in the middle of two wars. The Pentagon, acknowledging pressure to allow gay people to serve openly, carried out the survey to establish whether serving soldiers and families were concerned about the change and whether it might impact on morale.

Author and contrarian Christopher Hitchens dies at age 62
A contrarian in life, the writer Christopher Hitchens united the world in death, with friends, colleagues and even debating opponents joining to celebrate his fearless intellect, ready wit and diamantine prose after he died from cancer at the age of 62. Salman Rushdie took to Twitter to mourn the passing of a "beloved friend", writing "A great voice falls silent. Richard Dawkins said he was "one of the greatest orators of all time", and called him "a polymath, a wit ... and a valiant fighter against all tyrants including imaginary supernatural ones." The former prime minister Tony Blair, who Hitchens bested in a debate over religion at the end of last year, said he was "fearless in the pursuit of truth" and praised his "passion, commitment and brilliance". Writing in for the Mail online his brother Peter, acknowledged a "complex relationship" which included a public falling out in 2001, but went on to praise his "courage". "My brother possessed this virtue to the very end, and if I often disagreed with the purposes for which he used it, I never doubted the quality or ceased to admire it," he said. The reactions to Hitchens's diagnosis of oesophageal cancer in June 2010 from his intellectual opponents – which ranged from undisguised glee to offers of prayers – testified to his stature as one of the leading voices of secularism since the publication in 2007 of his anti-religious polemic God is Not Great. The reaction from the author himself, who after a lifetime of "burning the candle of both ends" described his illness as "something so predictable and banal that it bores even me", testified to the sharpness of his wit and the clarity of his thinking under fire, as he dissected the discourse of "struggle" that surrounds cancer, paid tribute to the medical staff who looked after him and resolved to "resist bodily as best I can, even if only passively, and to seek the most advanced advice". Born in 1949, Hitchens was sent to boarding school at the age of eight, his mother deciding: "If there is going to be an upper class in this country, then Christopher is going to be in it." This resolution pursued him to his time at Oxford, where he confessed to leading a "double life" as both an "ally of the working class" and as a guest at cocktail parties where he could meet "near-legendary members of the establishment's firmament on nearly equal terms". A resolution to spend time at least once a year in "a country less fortunate than [his] own" spurred him to witness the stirrings of revolution in Portugal and Poland, as well as counter-revolution in Argentina.

Interpol orders arrest of Wikileaks founder to face rape charges
(CNN) -- Interpol, at the request of a Swedish court looking into alleged sex crimes from earlier this year, has put WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on its most-wanted listed. The Stockholm Criminal Court two weeks ago issued an international arrest warrant for Assange on probable cause, saying he is suspected of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force in August incidents. Sweden asked Interpol, the international police organization, to post a "Red Notice" after a judge approved a motion to bring him into custody. The "Red Notice" is not an international arrest warrant. It is an advisory and request, issued to 188 member countries "to assist the national police forces in identifying or locating those persons with a view to their arrest and extradition," according to Interpol. The Swedish court ordered Assange, 39, formally arrested in his absence, which requires Swedish authorities anywhere in the world to detain Assange if they come across him. "The background is that he has to be heard in this investigation and we haven't been able to get a hold of him to question him," Ny said at the time. Assange faces five counts that appear related to two incidents, according to the request Ny filed with the court. Assange could be sentenced to at least two years in prison if convicted, according to the document. Swedish Migration Board official Gunilla Wikstrom said his application failed to fulfill all the requirements but declined to give details.

British government scraps planned rules on pay equality
The Government has scrapped plans to force big businesses to disclose the difference in pay for men and women they employ, on the day it emerged that little progress had been made in bringing women into the boardroom. The equalities minister, Lynne Featherstone, said yesterday she had ditched plans drawn up by the previous government and due to come into force in 2013, calling it a "blueprint for change". Employers will now be asked to publish gender pay data on a voluntary basis only. A spokesman for the Home Office said the Government would work closely with business to make sure the approach was successful. This marks a stark U-turn from Ms Featherstone, who said in opposition that a voluntary audit system "is hardly worth the paper it's printed on". The Government said it would monitor the number of companies releasing pay information each year, to assess whether the voluntary approach had been a success. Mandatory reporting has not been ruled out if the results are unsatisfactory. Speaking at the launch of the 2010 Female FTSE 100 report, drawn up by the Cranfield School of Management, Ms Featherstone said: "We want to move away from the arrogant notion that government knows best, to one where government empowers individuals, businesses and communities to make change happen." She criticised Labour's plans as bringing in red tape, adding that it "wasn't just a futile approach, it was a damaging one". She said: "Bucketloads of regulations were being dumped on businesses already struggling to keep their heads above water in the recession." Ceri Goddard, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for equal pay, pointed out that women in the UK were paid, on average, one sixth less than men.

UK Parliament to vote on tuition fee rise on Thursday
Image caption Lib Dem ministers have said the party will approach the vote in a disciplined manner MPs are to vote on controversial plans to raise tuition fees in England on 9 December, ministers have confirmed. The vote will be a critical test for the coalition, which has faced mass protests over its plan to nearly double fees to £6,000 and allow charges of up to £9,000 for some courses. But student leaders say the proposals - which followed the independent Browne review of student finance - will deter people from poorer backgrounds from applying to university. The National Union of Students have said they will hold a "day of action" on Wednesday 8 December, on the eve of the Commons vote. The deputy prime minister and Lib Dem party leader Nick Clegg has been speaking to all his MPs to try and forge an agreed position on what the party will do when the issue comes before Parliament. Voting intentions The Lib Dems' coalition agreement with the Conservatives allows their MPs to abstain in votes on tuition fees, reflecting the party's longstanding opposition to the charges - currently capped at £3,290. However, a number of Lib Dem MPs - including party president Tim Farron and former leader Sir Menzies Campbell - have indicated they intend to vote against. However he has hinted he might abstain if that is what his party agrees - a position described as "outrageous" by Labour. Student leaders have accused the Lib Dems of betraying their pre-election pledge not to raise fees and the party has been the focus of anger at protests across the country in recent weeks. But Mr Clegg and Mr Cable have defended the proposals - which will see no upfront payments and graduates starting to repay the cost of their degrees when they earn £21,000. The BBC's Political Correspondent Carole Walker said Thursday's vote would be limited to whether to approve the £9,000 fee ceiling for 2012-3 and other matters would be considered in the new year - when ministers are expected to publish a white paper on the future of universities.

UN says it won't leave Ivory Coast
UNITED NATIONS Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.N. peacekeepers will remain in Ivory Coast and fulfill their mandate despite calls by incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo for all blue helmets to leave the country, the U.N. chief said on Saturday. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is determined that "UNOCI (U.N. mission in Ivory Coast) will fulfill its mandate and will continue to monitor and document any human rights violations, incitement to hatred and violence, or attacks on U.N. peacekeepers," spokesman Farhan Haq said in a statement. ABIDJAN The government of Ivory Coast's incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo on Saturday told the United Nations and French peacekeeping missions to leave, escalating a dispute over last month's elections. Both the United Nations and the former colonial power, France, have urged Gbagbo to concede defeat in a November 28 poll, which was meant to heal the wounds of the West African state's 2002-03 civil war but has instead reopened them. "UNOCI has interfered seriously in the internal affairs of Ivory Coast," she said. The country has been in turmoil since Gbagbo claimed victory in the election with backing from the pro-Gbagbo Constitutional Council, the nation's highest legal body, rejecting as fraudulent results showing that he had lost by nearly 8 percentage points to Alassane Ouattara. A spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Ivory Coast, Hamadoun Toure, said by telephone that it was still preparing a response.

South Korea and US hold joint exercises; North does not retaliate
Image caption The threat of a North Korean response has caused anxiety in the South North Korea says it will not retaliate despite "reckless provocations" from the South, which held live-fire drills on the flashpoint island of Yeonpyeong. The North shelled the island last month after similar drills and had threatened more retaliation this time. But state media quoted the army as saying it was "not worth reacting". Meanwhile US politician Bill Richardson, on a visit to the North, says it has agreed to allow UN inspectors back into the country. The New Mexico governor, who is in Pyongyang in an unofficial capacity, said he had been told during meetings that members of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be allowed renewed access to a uranium enrichment facility. There has been no official comment from the North, and it is unclear which facility Mr Richardson was referring to. Inspectors, who had been monitoring the Yongbyon nuclear plant, were expelled from the country in April 2009. The South's government has been under huge domestic pressure to take a tough stance towards Pyongyang, in the wake of the 23 November shelling of Yeonpyeong, which killed four people. 'Make dialogue, not war' The South ordered residents of Yeonpyeong and several other islands to take cover in air-raid shelters early on Monday.

British Business Secretary Cable stripped of powers after 'totally unacceptable and inappropriate' comments
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Cable: "I have declared war on Mr Murdoch" Business Secretary Vince Cable will stay in cabinet despite "declaring war" on Rupert Murdoch, says Downing Street. But he will be stripped of his powers to rule on Mr Murdoch's bid to take control of BSkyB, which will be handed to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Downing Street said David Cameron believed Mr Cable's comments about Mr Murdoch were "totally unacceptable and inappropriate". BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson said Downing Street's statement was a "humiliating slap in the face" for Mr Cable and although he had kept his job he was still in a "very awkward" position, with questions over his judgement after telling "complete strangers" highly sensitive political information. Nick Robinson said some Tory MPs would be questioning whether Mr Cable - who is seen as a key figure in holding the coalition together - would have been "out on his ear" if he had been a member of their party. In a statement, a Downing Street spokesman said: "Following comments made by Vince Cable to the Daily Telegraph, the prime minister has decided that he will play no further part in the decision over News Corporation's proposed takeover of BSkyB. "This includes full responsibility for Ofcom's activities in these areas. 'Picking fights' Mr Cable said in a statement: "I fully accept the decision of the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. News Corporation, which already owns 39% of BSkyB but wants to buy up the remaining 61% for £7.8bn, said Mr Cable's unguarded remarks raised "serious questions about fairness and due process".

Obama signs landmark law overturning 'don't ask, don't tell'
President Obama signed into law a repeal of the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy Wednesday, fulfilling a campaign promise and marking a historic step forward for gay rights. The law "will strengthen our national security and uphold the ideals our fighting men and women defend," Obama told a cheering crowd of gay and lesbian service members and their supporters in Washington. "No longer will thousands of men and women in uniform be asked to live a lie or look over their shoulder while serving the country they love." "This is the right thing to do for our military, and I believe it is the right thing to do period." The law ends the legal underpinnings for the ban on openly gay troops, but it does not immediately overturn the policy itself. Officials say the 17-year-old ban will remain throughout the military until the president, Defense secretary and Congress certify that the military is prepared to put in place a repeal. Then, a 60-day waiting period begins before the ban is officially removed from the books. "I have spoken to every one of the service chiefs, and they are all committed to implementing this change swiftly and efficiently. While some advocates have bristled at the timing, many could not deny the enormity of the moment and said it would be a defining element of Obama's legacy. "A measure of dignity has been restored to thousands of service members on active duty, and to over a million gay veterans who served in silence." The move is expected to eventually end ongoing investigations and open the door to thousands of discharged service members to return to the military and resume their careers.

'Serious' terror threat in Mumbai; police hunt four suspected militants
Image caption Mumbai police have released a picture of one of the suspects and named him as Walid Jinnah Police are scouring Mumbai for four Pakistani alleged militants believed to have entered the city to carry out an attack, a top police official said. There was credible information that at least four members of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group were in the city, said the police commissioner. Police have released a sketch of one of the suspects, set up checkpoints and placed extra officers on patrol. Roads were closed on Friday in and around the luxury Taj Mahal Palace hotel - the focus of the deadly siege two years ago - and armed police were patrolling at high-profile sites, including consulates. Joint police commissioner Himanshu Roy told a news conference on Thursday evening: "The four men are planning violent attacks that are going to cause destruction." NEW DELHI - A day after issuing a terror alert for the holiday week, police in India's commercial capital of Mumbai launched a manhunt Friday for four terrorist suspects thought to have sneaked into the city. We cannot take any of these intelligence inputs lightly in the holiday season," said Nisar Tamboli, deputy commissioner of police in the Mumbai crime department.

'Very serious': Chinese government releases corruption report
Image caption There was public anger over the activities of Wen Qiang, executed after he was convicted of rape and taking bribes China says its corruption problem is "still very serious" and has set out new measures to tackle it. In a new report on the fight against corruption, the authorities say more than 200,000 cases have been investigated since 2003. They say their efforts to date have "yielded notable results" but resolve to make them more effective. Critics say that corruption is ingrained in the system and new regulations will not solve the problem. The report carried by the official state news agency Xinhua says that between 2003 and 2009, prosecutors investigated more than 240,000 cases, including embezzlement and bribery. It highlights new rules requiring members of the governing Communist party to report incomes and investments. The party also says it will curb excessive spending on official parties and seminars. The document praises the role of the news media and the internet in exposing corrupt practices, declaring that "sunshine is the best antiseptic". "Since the relevant mechanisms and systems are still incomplete, corruption persists, with some cases even involving huge sums of money," it says. In July 2010, the top justice official in the city of Chongqing, Wen Qiang, was executed after being convicted of accepting bribes, rape and shielding criminal gangs. Facing mounting public discontent over corruption and inequality, China 's State Council, or Cabinet, launched its first ever white paper yesterday to "Combat Corruption and Build a Clean Government".

Former CIA agent indicted after leaking classified information
The logo of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency is shown in the lobby of the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia March 3, 2005. REUTERS/Jason Reed WASHINGTON A former CIA officer was arrested on Thursday on charges of illegally disclosing national defense information about Iran to a New York Times reporter who wrote a book. The U.S. Justice Department said Jeffrey Sterling, 43, was charged with six counts of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information and one count of unlawfully keeping national defense information, mail fraud, unauthorized conveyance of government property and obstructing justice. The arrest marked the latest case brought by the Obama administration charging current or former U.S. officials with leaking classified information to the news media. It also has been investigating the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, for leaking hundreds of classified U.S. diplomatic cables that have embarrassed the White House. Sterling, a lawyer who worked at the CIA from 1993 to 2002, was arrested in St. Louis near where he lives. From 1998 through mid-2000, he was assigned to a classified clandestine program that conducted intelligence activities about the weapons capabilities of certain countries, the Justice Department said in announcing the indictment against Sterling. In the same time period, Sterling also was an operations officer who handled a human asset associated with that program, according to the indictment. CIA ACTIVITIES The indictment alleged that Sterling, retaliating for the CIA's refusal to settle on favorable terms his discrimination claims, disclosed information about the program. It said he discussed the information with the reporter in early 2003 and later in connection with a book published in January 2006. But the dates and other details in the indictment make clear it involved New York Times reporter James Risen, whose 2006 book "State of War" revealed details of the CIA's intelligence activities involving Iran.

US congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords shot at Arizona supermarket
More coverage on the shootings from affiliates KOLD, KVOA, KMSB, KPHO and KGUN. [Updated at 10:30 p.m. ET] A man who helped subdue the gunman in Saturday's Arizona shooting spree said the man was trying to reload when he was tackled to the ground. He was not playing around," Joe Zamudio told CNN. He had just ran out of bullets." The gun, which another bystander had wrestled from the gunman, was empty and cocked open, and the shooter had another magazine at the ready, Zamudio said. Zamudio pinned him to the ground until police showed up. The suspect, 22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner, is in custody of the Pima County Sheriff's Office, and authorities are obtaining search warrants for a residence and his vehicle. Authorities also are seeking a person of interest but his suspected connection to the incident is unclear. Loughner is accused of shooting 18 people, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a third-term Democrat who had organized the "Congress on Your Corner" meet and greet. She is in critical condition after undergoing surgery for a single gunshot wound to the head, but doctors said they are optimistic over her prospects for recovery.

Tucson gunman appears in court for Giffords shooting
Image caption Jared Loughner faces several charges over the attack on Saturday A man charged with trying to assassinate a US congresswoman in a shooting that left six people dead and more than a dozen wounded has appeared in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head, remains in a critical condition but doctors say the swelling in her brain has stabilised. Among the dead were a nine-year-old girl and a federal judge. President Barack Obama, who led the US in a silent tribute from the South Lawn of the White House on Monday morning, said a priority for the nation was "making sure we are joining together, pulling together as a country". The president will travel to Arizona on Wednesday to attend a memorial service for the victims of the Arizona shooting, administration officials said. Arizona court hearing Mr Loughner walked into the courtroom wearing handcuffs and in a prison uniform, with a cut on the right side of his head. During the 13-minute hearing, Mr Loughner said very little, only periodically leaning forward to speak into a microphone. Mr Loughner, who did not enter a plea, confirmed his identity and had an attorney appointed to defend him. When asked, he said he understood that he could get life in prison or the death penalty for allegedly killing federal Judge John Roll on Saturday in Tucson, Arizona. A chain around his waist held his hands in place in front of him.

State of emergency declared in Tunisia
Echoes of Tunisia's unprecedented mass unrest are reverberating across the Arab world – which is watching in fascination as one of the most repressive regimes in the regions makes far-reaching concessions to people power. Protests over rising food and fuel prices triggered emergency economic measures from Jordan to Libya and Morocco this week as dramatic scenes of street clashes in the small north African country fuelled official nervousness about a domino effect that could shake other authoritarian states short on jobs, hopes and freedoms. "Every Arab leader is watching Tunisia in fear," tweeted one Egyptian commentator. The impact of Tunisia's unrest is all the greater because Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali – known to his long-suffering subjects as "Ben A Vie" ("president for life") – had been seen as one of the most effective of Arab autocrats. His announcement on Wednesday that he will not stand for another term is a huge boost for reform, whatever happens next. The obvious contrast is with Egypt, the most populous of Arab countries. Hosni Mubarak, 82, who like Ben Ali keeps Islamists firmly out of power and tolerates only weak secular opposition, is seeking another presidential term next year- when he will mark three decades in power. If Ben Ali, 74, is on his way out, that will be a democratic advance and a ringing wake-up call for a region where a trend towards republican dynasties – in Syria, Libya and Egypt – sits alongside the hereditary monarchies and emirates of the Gulf and Morocco. Another message read: "To my Tunisian brothers and sisters: keep it up, all Arab peoples are watching you with admiration and envy." Jerky mobile-phone images of blood spreading from the fatal gunshot wound of one Tunisian demonstrator provided Arabs with their own equivalent of Neda Agha-Soltan, the young Iranian woman killed in Tehran during protests after the disputed 2009 presidential elections.

Toyota recalls 1.7m cars after new concerns
Image caption The Japanese transport ministry said slight cracks could appear in fuel pipes Car manufacturer Toyota is recalling nearly 19,000 cars in the UK over concerns about possible problems with fuel systems. Hundreds of Toyota Avensis and Lexus IS 250 models could be at risk of fuel leaks and will need to be modified by mechanics, the company said. But it said there had been no accidents suspected of being linked to the defects. The move is part of a recall of nearly 1.7 million vehicles globally. Officials said they were writing to the owners of the affected vehicles to arrange repairs. In a statement, the company said: "As a result of customer feedback in other markets worldwide, Toyota GB today announced it would recall a number of its Toyota Avensis and Lexus IS 250 models in the UK to carry out modifications to their fuel systems. "It is working with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (Vosa) to contact registered owners and keepers by letter to advise them of the procedure for taking their vehicle to an authorised Toyota or Lexus repairer for the necessary work to be done." About 15,500 British owners of Toyota Avensis 2.0-litre and 2.4-litre petrol engine models, produced between July 2000 and September 2008, are eligible for the free repair, which could take up to four-and-a-half hours. Jon Williams, managing director of Toyota GB PLC, said: "We are committed to putting the customer first and have a total focus on the quality of all our products. We will liaise with our customers to carry out the repair procedures as efficiently as possible, with minimal disruption." TOKYO — Toyota will fix about 1.7 million vehicles globally in two separate recalls over defective fuel lines and high-pressure fuel pumps, the Japanese automaker said Wednesday, drawing renewed attention to the quality of the company’s products. The decision to call back the vehicles follows promises by Toyota to be swifter in addressing problems in its products after it was criticized as being slow to react to previous defects.

Egypt anti-government protests continue, Internet shut down
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters have defied the curfew and begun setting vehicles and buildings alight Egypt has extended its curfew to all cities as anti-government demonstrators in Cairo besiege key buildings, including the foreign ministry and the state broadcaster. The headquarters of the governing NDP party has been set ablaze. President Hosni Mubarak, facing the biggest challenge to his authority of his 31 years in power, has ordered the army onto the streets of Cairo. Earlier, it was announced he would make a statement, but he is yet to appear. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said: "Every minute that goes by without the president making that address to the nation makes him look weaker and will convince people he is losing his grip." At least 18 protesters - 13 in Suez and five in Cairo - were killed in the violence on Friday, medical sources said. That brings the death toll to at least 26 since the protests began on Tuesday. Military helicopters Across the country, tens of thousands of protesters turned out after Friday prayers and clashed with police. But if these protests continue and intensify, there are bound to be senior voices within the military tempted to urge him to stand down. This is the most serious popular challenge to his 30-year rule that anyone can remember. Egypt's army: The deciding factor The curfew is now in effect, but live television pictures from Cairo continue to show large crowds on the streets.

Egypt protests: Army say they will not use force on demonstrators as Mubarak announces cabinet
0156: Many were expecting the image of a dead Osama Bin Laden to be released - in much the same way as the pictures of Uday and Qusay Hussein in 2003 - to prove his death. But, says the BBC's Jonny Dymond in Washington, there has been almost no triumphalism from the Obama administration over the al-Qaeda leader's demise. Great pains were taken to detail the respect with which his corpse was treated. That could all have been undone with the release of photographs, and many doubters in any case would have found reason not to believe in their authenticity, he adds. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Lyse Doucet describes the protests in Tahrir Square Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has announced a new cabinet amid pressure from protesters, who have gathered in Cairo again in their tens of thousands. However, correspondents say it is likely demonstrators will only settle for Mr Mubarak's removal from office. The army has vowed it will not use force against the protesters, who have called a massive march on Tuesday. The army said in a statement carried on Egyptian media: "To the great people of Egypt, your armed forces, acknowledging the legitimate rights of the people... have not and will not use force against the Egyptian people." The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says this is a devastating blow to Mr Mubarak because to regain control of the streets he would need the use, or at least the threat of the use, of the army. 'Bluffing' Mr Mubarak, who has been in power for 30 years, has ordered new Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq to push through democratic reforms and create new jobs. But there are few major changes in the new cabinet line-up, with Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit and Defence Minister Gen Mohamed Hussein Tantawi - who also becomes deputy PM - both keeping their posts.

Egyptian president will not seek re-election in September after protests
The White House Wednesday condemned the violence against protesters in Egypt as "outrageous and deplorable" and suggested that it may have been orchestrated by President Hosni Mubarak's government. "Obviously, if any of the violence is instigated by the government, it should stop immediately," spokesman Robert Gibbs said. He reiterated Obama's public call Tuesday evening, communicated directly to Mubarak in a telephone call, that "the time for a transition has come, and that time is now." As events moved quickly in Egypt, where the massive protests that were peaceful Tuesday turned violent as dark fell on Wednesday, the administration struggled to stay abreast. U.S. military leaders with contacts in Egypt's officer corps worked the telephones to find out why the army had not forcefully intervened when apparent pro-Mubarak activists moved against those still occupying Tahrir Square in central Cairo, and to urge them to quell the clashes. As an high-level interagency group convened for crisis consultations at the White House, officials were examining the complicated web of U.S. aid programs in Egypt to determine where leverage might best be used. While Obama on Tuesday predicted "difficult days ahead" in Egypt, the White House seemed taken aback by the swift turn of events on the ground Wednesday. "Some of the president's time, obviously, has been dedicated to watching, taking note of and responding to the events...what we're watching is history being made." The special administration envoy sent to Cairo over the weekend, retired diplomat Frank G. Wisner, was asked to stay in Egypt and continue conversations with Mubarak and other officials. The U.S. military has also begun tallying what a senior official called its "assets and capabilities" in the region in case a more robust evacuation of American diplomats and citizens in Egypt became necessary. On Monday, the State Department began operating charter flights for voluntary departures and on Tuesday it ordered all diplomatic families and non-essential personnel to leave the country.

Massive snowstorm blasts most of United States
Midwest buckles under major winter storm CHICAGO  Residents across the country began digging out of snow and ice Wednesday after a record-setting storm crippled cities and forecasters warned there was more bad weather on the way. Snow continued to fall in Chicago on Wednesday after the city recorded 20.2 inches making it the third-largest snowfall on record. The area struggled to recover from a crippling blizzard that shut down roads and train service and left hundreds of motorists stranded. At an early morning briefing, city officials urged residents to stay home as plows try to clear roads of giant drifts from winds that gusted overnight to 70 mph. The city shut down Lake Shore Drive for the first time in years as an untold number of motorists were stranded overnight after multiple car accidents on the iconic roadway. The National Weather Service said snow will fall before the storm moves away and winds of 20 to 30 mph will continue through much of the day. A storm brewing in the south at the end of the week will move up the East Coast bring rain and snow across the Northeast. Across the country, the storm system was blamed for at least 10 deaths, including that of a homeless man burned on New York's Long Island as he tried to light cans of cooking fuel, and an Oklahoma City woman who was being pulled behind a truck on a sled that hit a guard rail. In Chicago, airlines canceled more than 2,200 flights at O'Hare International Airport, and 400 flights at Midway International Airport. Security guard Ed Ransom, 36, stopped for coffee after a long bus ride to work Wednesday morning. "They warned us we would be getting a big one, and they sure were right." The monstrous storm billed as the worst in decades barreled across the country from Texas to Maine, bringing a huge swath of the country to a halt, depositing dangerous amounts of ice and snow before hitting the winter-weary Northeast.

Egyptian military appoints committee to amend constitution
Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood will apply to become a political party, it announced Tuesday. The Brotherhood "envisions the establishment of a democratic, civil state that draws on universal measures of freedom and justice, with central Islamic values serving all Egyptians regardless of colour, creed, political trend or religion," it said in the statement. Although officially illegal, the Muslim Brotherhood is regarded as one of the most organized groups in Egypt. It has said it does not plan to run a candidate for president when elections are held to replace Hosni Mubarak, who resigned on Friday. Although officially illegal, the Muslim Brotherhood is regarded as one of the most organized groups in Egypt. Experts estimate the group has the support of anywhere from 10% to 30% of the population. It has said it does not plan to run a candidate for president when elections are held to replace Hosni Mubarak, who resigned on Friday. President Barack Obama recently downplayed the prospect of the Muslim Brotherhood playing a major role in Egypt, saying it is just one faction in Egypt that doesn't have majority support. "And it's important for us not to say that our only two options are either the Muslim Brotherhood or a suppressed Egyptian people." "They are a powerful force at present, but my fear is that Islamist groups outside Egypt, seeing the opportunity in the current chaos, will flood them with support if they back an extremist view," said CNN national security contributor Frances Fragos Townsend, who was President George W. Bush's counterterrorism advisor.

Kuwait stateless protest for rights
* Dozens arrested in first protest in Kuwait * Police break up march, officers reported hurt (Adds ministry statements, officers hurt) KUWAIT, Feb 18 (Reuters) - More than 1,000 stateless Arabs demonstrated in Kuwait on Friday demanding citizenship, and dozens were arrested by police, witnesses said. The protest in Jahra, northwest of Kuwait City, was the first in the oil-producing Gulf Arab state since a wave of unrest began sweeping across the Middle East in December. Security forces dispersed the demonstration, using smoke bombs and water cannon after protesters refused warnings to leave. The Interior Ministry said protesters threw stones after being told their demonstration was illegal and several officers were injured, the state news agency KUNA said. The stateless Arabs, longtime residents of Kuwait known as bedoun from the Arabic "bedoun jinsiyya" (without nationality), were demanding citizenship, free education, free healthcare and jobs, benefits available to Kuwaiti nationals. Many of Kuwait's stateless are descendants of desert nomads denied citizenship under strict nationality laws in the small Gulf state, whose citizens are entitled to generous welfare benefits. At least 1,000 Arabs demonstrate to demand citizenship in Gulf country, leading to dozens of arrests. A wave of political unrest has swept across Africa and the Middle East since December [GALLO/GETTY] At least 1,000 stateless Arabs have demonstrated in Kuwait demanding citizenship, leading to dozens of them being arrested by police, witnesses have said. Ambulances rushed an unspecified number of wounded protesters and security forces away from the scene, with a witness telling the AFP news agency that at least five people were hurt, one of them seriously. "The protest of bidoons is legitimate and the government is responsible for this because it has failed to resolve the problem," independent MP Daifallah Buramia said. Stateless Arabs, estimated at more than 100,000, claim they have the right to Kuwaiti citizenship, but the government says that ancestors of many of them came from neighbouring countries and they are not entitled to nationality.

Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to be extradited to Sweden
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Assange says he will appeal against the ruling Wikileaks founder Julian Assange should be extradited to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations, a judge has ruled. At Belmarsh Magistrates' Court in south London, District Judge Howard Riddle said the extradition would not breach Mr Assange's human rights. Mr Assange said the ruling, which he will challenge, was due to a "European Arrest Warrant system run amok". He believes the claims are politically motivated because of Wikileaks' publication of sensitive material - including leaked US diplomatic cables - from governments and high-profile organisations that has made headlines worldwide. Bail was granted then after he had spent nine days in Wandsworth prison in London following his arrest under a European Arrest Warrant on 7 December. Following the extradition ruling on Thursday, Mr Assange said: "What we saw today at Belmarsh was a rubber-stamping process. It comes as no surprise, but is nonetheless wrong. But he remains in limbo as his lawyers begin to construct an appeal. It's likely to be tough - the judge commented that the defence team had already "left no stone unturned". The media circus that has surrounded this case continues, but fewer supporters turned out this morning compared with previous hearings.

Space Shuttle Discovery arrives at International Space Station
HOUSTON, Feb. 26 (UPI) -- The U.S. space shuttle Discovery successfully docked with the International Space Station Saturday, NASA said. Commander Steve Lindsey performed the maneuver at 2:14 p.m. EST, while the two spacecraft were orbiting 220 miles above western Australia. It was Discovery's 13th and final hookup with the space station. The hatches were set to open about 4:18 p.m., NASA said, and Discovery's crew of Lindsey, pilot Eric Boe, and mission specialists Alvin Drew, Steve Bowen, Mike Barratt and Nicole Stott will join space station commander Scott Kelly, and crew members Oleg Skripochka, Alexander Kaleri, Dmitry Kondratyev, Paolo Nespoli and Cady Coleman. The rendezvous finishes the roundup of all the spacecraft that fly to the station, with Russia's Soyuz and Progress, Japan's HTV and Europe's ATV already docked there, Florida Today reported. Fittingly, the astronauts got "Woody's Roundup" by Riders in the Sky, a Western song from the movie "Toy Story," for their 6:53 a.m. wake-up call. ET The shuttle Discovery glided to a picture-perfect docking with the International Space Station Saturday - the veteran spaceplane's 13th and final linkup with the orbiting outpost. With commander Steven Lindsey manually flying Discovery from the aft flight deck, the shuttle's payload bay docking system engaged its counterpart on the front end of the station's Harmony module at 2:14 p.m. EST (GMT-5), reports CBS News space consultant William Harwood. "Station and Houston, Discovery has capture confirmed," an astronaut radioed. Final launch of Space Shuttle Discovery CBS News' Space Place (Harwood blog) NASA's Space Shuttle Mission Home Page Later in the mission, if all goes well and mission managers concur, three station crew members will undock in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to photograph the lab complex and all the visiting vehicles from afar, capturing a unique moment that, with the shuttle's looming retirement, will never be repeated. But first, the combined crews have to accomplish the primary objectives of Discovery's mission, including attachment of a final U.S. module, loaded with critical supplies and equipment, and an external storage platform carrying a spare set of radiator panels. A few minutes after 1 p.m., Lindsey and pilot Eric Boe brought Discovery to a halt about 600 feet directly below the space station. At that point, Lindsey conducted a computer-assisted 360-degree back-flip maneuver, exposing the shuttle's belly and critical heat-shield tiles to the crew aboard the station.

Egyptian prime minister steps down; armed forces appoint former transport minister to position
Image caption Mr Shafiq was appointed days before President Mubarak was forced out of office Egypt's Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq has resigned, the country's ruling military council has announced in a statement. A former transport minister, Essam Sharaf, has been asked to form a new government, the statement adds. Mr Shafiq was appointed days before President Hosni Mubarak was forced out of office following days of anti-government protests. Protesters saw Mr Shafiq as too closely associated to Mr Mubarak's rule, observers say. "The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces decided to accept the resignation of Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq and appointed Essam Sharaf to form the new government," the army said in a statement on its Facebook page. Mr Shafiq was appointed by Mr Mubarak just days before he stepped down on 11 February after several weeks of popular protests against his rule. It had been one of the protesters' key demands that Mr Shafiq and other top ministers appointed at the end of the Mubarak rule step down. Analysis President Mubarak may have gone, but the protests in Cairo have been continuing as people have been demanding the "old guard" of politicians step down. As a result his resignation, announced by the Armed Forces Supreme Council on its website, has been broadly welcomed by opposition groups. But a big demonstration is still planned for Friday in Tahrir Square where hundreds of people have been camping out. The response from those demanding more change has been mixed, with some saying all politicians who served under Mr Mubarak should go while others think the new administration should be allowed to get on with the job of constitutional reform and elections. Mr Sharaf's appointment is significant as he spoke out in support of the revolution and took part in the street protests, says the BBC's Alastair Leithead in Cairo.

Relative of Afghan president Hamid Karzai shot dead by NATO troops
Haji Yar Mohammad Karzai was killed during a night raid in the early hours of Thursday, south of the city of Kandahar. The presidential palace said Mr Karzai was "extremely sad" at the news and once again called on Nato forces "to avoid killing civilians". Afghan officials said troops had raided a compound in Karz village of Dand district which is the home of the Karzai clan. During the raid at around 2am, Yar Mohammad, a cousin of the president's late father, had apparently tried to leave his home and had been mistakenly shot. Ahmad Wali Karzai, the president's brother and Kandahar's main powerbroker, said: "It was a mistake. The forces conducted an operation, he was at his home, he came out and was shot." A Nato press statement had said the raid targeted a Taliban leader who smuggled weapons and bombs to insurgents in Kandahar. When reports it was Yar Mohammad later emerged, the coalition said it was "aware of conflicting reports about the identities of those involved" and had begun an investigation. He recently refused initially to accept an apology from Gen David Petraeus after a coalition helicopter mistakenly killed nine boys in an airstrike as they collected firewood in Kunar province. Yar Mohammad, who was aged around 60, was the principal player in a vendetta which has split the Karzai family for 30 years. He allegedly killed the father of Hashmat Karzai, a first cousin of the president, in Quetta in a row over a failed arranged marriage.

IPad 2 goes on sale in United States
The buzz is already building as the much anticipated iPad 2 hits shelves tomorrow. Apple sold 15 million iPad gadgets in just nine short months and many anticipate big numbers with version 2.0. "Early Show" technology expert Katie Linendoll is one of the very first to get a sneak peek at one of the iPad 2s. She showed "Early Show" co-anchor Erica Hill the cool, innovative features that are sure to put a smile on consumers' faces. But what exactly are the changes to the iPad 2 -- and why all the hype? According to Linendoll, the iPad 2 is essentially a better product, but it still costs the same -- they range from $499 to $829. Here are some of the differences: It is lighter (1.3lbs), thinner and faster. It comes in both black and white, and there is the addition of Apple Smart Covers. The front- and rear-facing cameras record video, take pictures and offer video chats. So really, the sky is the limit with how much you can do with this little device," she explained.

8.9 magnitude earthquake hits Japan, causes tsunami
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The quake hit at 1446 local time (0546 GMT) and this is how the disaster unfolded Japan's most powerful earthquake since records began has struck the north-east coast, triggering a massive tsunami. Cars, ships and buildings were swept away by a wall of water after the 8.9-magnitude tremor, which struck about 400km (250 miles) north-east of Tokyo. A state of emergency has been declared at a nuclear power plant, where pressure has exceeded normal levels. Officials say 350 people are dead and about 500 missing, but it is feared the final death toll will be much higher. In one ward alone in Sendai, a port city in Miyagi prefecture, 200 to 300 bodies were found. The quake was the fifth-largest in the world since 1900 and nearly 8,000 times stronger than the one which devastated Christchurch, New Zealand, last month, said scientists. Thousands of people living near the Fukushima nuclear power plant have been ordered to evacuate. Even after the most violent earthquake anyone could remember the crowds were orderly and calm. There a tsunami triggered by the quake reached 10km (six miles) inland in places carrying houses, buildings, boats and cars with it. In the city of Sendai the police found up to 300 bodies in a single ward.

British MP reveals Fred Goodwin superinjunction
The existence of the draconian injunction - so strict it prevents Sir Fred being identified as a banker - was disclosed by John Hemming, a back-bench Liberal Democrat MP, in a question during a business debate at the House on Thursday morning. His comments are protected by parliamentary privilege. He said: "In a secret hearing Fred Goodwin has obtained a super-injunction preventing him being identified as a banker. "Will the government have a debate or a statement on freedom of speech and whether there's one rule for the rich like Fred Goodwin and one rule for the poor?" Leader of the House Sir George Young said a forthcoming Westminster Hall debate would explore freedom of speech, adding: "I will raise with the appropriate minister the issue he has just raised." The terms of the injunction are so strict that the Daily Telegraph cannot reveal the nature of the information that Sir Fred Goodwin is attempting to protect. Sir Fred, nicknamed Fred "the shred" for his management style, presided over the near collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which had to be bailed out by the taxpayer. Super-injunctions - under which even reporting the existence of the injunction is banned - are increasingly being used by powerful corporations and wealthy individuals to stop the media from publishing information. Last month a sportsman known to have cheated on his partner with two women won an appeal to remain anonymous. The judge said his identity had to be protected because the fact he had conducted a previous affair would make it easier for people to work out the nature of the allegations. Three days later Mr Justice Eady granted anonymity to a married TV personality identified only by the random initials OPQ. Sir Fred Goodwin, the former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland who became a focal point for anger over the financial crisis, has obtained a super-injunction banning the media from identifying him as a banker.

Explosion at earthquake-damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Damian Grammaticas reports on the destruction wrought by the tsunami in Sendai A powerful explosion has hit a nuclear power station in north-eastern Japan which was badly damaged in Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami. A building housing a reactor was destroyed, but authorities said the reactor itself was intact. The government sought to play down fears of a meltdown at the Fukushima 1 plant. But officials later announced the cooling system of a second reactor at the plant had failed. The news sparked fears of a the risk of a further explosion or leak of radioactive material. A huge rescue and relief operation is under way in the region after the earthquake and subsequent tsunami, which are thought to have killed more than 1,000 people. An evacuation zone around the damaged nuclear plant has been extended to 20km (12.4 miles) from 10km, and a state of emergency declared. Analysis The term "meltdown" raises associations with two nuclear accidents in living memory: Three Mile Island in the US in 1979, and Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986. In both, excess heat in the reactor caused fuel to melt - and in the first, wider melting of the core. However, the detection of caesium isotopes outside the power station buildings could imply that the core has been exposed to the air. Although Japan has a long and largely successful nuclear power programme, officials have been less than honest about some incidents in the past, meaning that official reassurances are unlikely to convince everyone this time round.

Al Jazeera cameraman killed in eastern Libya
Cameraman Ali Hassan Al Jaber was returning to eastern city of Benghazi from filing report when he was shot and killed. 'Here and now, Libyan and Qatari blood is mixed for the sake of freedom. Our condolences go to the Qatari people and the Al Jazeera channel' read a banner held in Benghazi An Al Jazeera cameraman has been killed in what appears to have been an ambush near the rebel-held city of Benghazi in eastern Libya. Ali Hassan Al Jaber was returning to Benghazi from a nearby town after filing a report from an opposition protest when unknown fighters opened fire on a car he and his colleagues were travelling in. Al Jazeera's Tony Birtley, reporting from Benghazi, said Al Jaber was hit by three shots and was wounded through the heart. "This is an extension of the campaign against Al Jazeera, and Al Jazeera Arabic particularly - because everyone here watch Al Jazeera Arabic. Their work has been heroic, and it has been a great shock to lose a colleague." 'Cowardly crime' Wadah Khanfar, the director-general of Al Jazeera, said the network "will not remain silent" and will pursue those behind the ambush through legal channels. He said that the killing came after "an unprecedented campaign" against the network by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. " /> Wadah Khanfar said Al Jazeera will not remain silent in the wake of Al Jaber's killing "Al Jazeera condemns the cowardly crime, which comes as part of the Libyan regime's malicious campaign targeting Al Jazeera and its staff," the network said in a statement. "Al Jazeera stresses it will relentlessly prosecute and bring to justice all perpetrators and their accomplices." Al Jaber, a Qatari national, was born in 1955 and received his bachelor and master's degrees in cinematography from the Academy of Arts in Cairo.

US rapper Nate Dogg dies at age 41
Friend of Snoop Dogg who featured on hit record Regulate was recovering from two strokes he had suffered in recent years Hip-hop star Nathaniel Dwayne Hale, known by his stage name Nate Dogg, has died aged 41. The cause of his death is unclear but the Californian rapper had been recovering from two strokes he suffered in recent years. Hale began singing as a child in baptist churches under the care of his father, who was a pastor. At the age of 16 he dropped out of high school in Long Beach, California, and joined the US marine corps, where he served for three years. In 1991, he formed a rap trio with Snoop Dogg and Warren G, and first found fame as a guest on Dr Dre's classic album The Chronic. With Warren G, he had a huge hit with Regulate, which reached No 5 in the UK charts in 1994. In total, he featured on four UK hits and also collaborated with Eminem, Ludacris, Tupac Shakur and Mark Ronson. "We lost a true legend n hip hop n rnb" Snoop Dogg tweeted.

Self-taught chemist Owsley “Bear” Stanley, a legend of the 1960s psychedelic underground who produced the LSD that fueled Ken Kesey’s “acid tests” and the Grateful Dead’s acid rock, died March 13 after a car accident in Queensland, Australia, where he had lived since the 1980s. Mr. Stanley, the grandson of a Kentucky governor, grew up in the Washington area before he found his calling in Berkeley,­Calif., as an early patron of the Dead and one of the first people to produce mass quantities of acid. “I just wanted to know the dose and purity of what I took into my own body,” he told Rolling Stone magazine in 2007. “Almost before I realized what was happening, the whole affair had gotten completely out of hand. I was not responsible for his wings, but they did carry me to all kinds of places.” Working at first from a makeshift bathroom laboratory in Berkeley, Mr. Stanley produced at least 1 million doses of LSD between 1965 and 1967. A stubborn, fast-talking perfectionist, he discarded any batch suspected of impurities and soon gained a reputation for producing reliably pure and powerful LSD.

Expedition 26 crew returns to Earth safely
Space station crew lands in Arctic conditions American astronaut Scott Kelly and his Russian space station crewmates landed safely in brutally arctic conditions Wednesday on the wind-and-snow swept steppes of Kazakhstan, prompting a hurry-up recovery. Stiff winds were gusting up to and beyond 30 knots — conditions that gave flight surgeons enough pause to cancel the traditional raising of an inflatable medical tent. The returning space travelers instead were whisked off in helicopters to the north-central city of Kustanai, Kazakhstan, before heading back to Star City outside Moscow. NASA spokesman Rob Navias, who is at the landing site, said it is "too cold, too windy, too arctic" to do anything else. However, the conditions are relatively normal for this time of year in Kazakhstan, and Russian recovery forces "are old hands" at dealing with rough winter conditions, Navias said. The return of Kelly — twin brother of shuttle Endeavour commander Mark Kelly and brother-in-law to recovering Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz. — Alexander Kaleri and Oleg Skripochka ends the 26th expedition to the International Space Station, which has been staffed around the clock since the first crew opened the outpost in November 2000. Kaleri, who now has tallied 770 days in orbit during five separate flights — now is the second most-experienced space traveler of all time. Krikalev now is the director of the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City outside Moscow, where the Expedition 26 crew is headed.

UN Security Council approves Libya no-fly zone
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Ian Pannell in Benghazi: "Very jubilant scenes within seconds of that UN resolution" The UN Security Council has backed a no-fly zone over Libya and "all necessary measures" to protect civilians short of an occupation. It was not immediately clear what form intervention would take and when it would begin, though France signalled that action could start soon. The resolution appears to give legal weight to attacks against Col Muammar Gaddafi's ground forces. Col Gaddafi's forces have recently retaken several towns seized by rebels. Rebel forces reacted with joy to the UN resolution in their Benghazi stronghold, but a government spokesman condemned UN "aggression". Loyalist forces are bearing down on Benghazi, home to a million people. Analysis Contingency planning in the UK, France and Nato has been going on for weeks, but will now be accelerated. The UN resolution is so broad it allows military action against all threats to civilians - so could even involve bombing Col Gaddafi's forces on the ground if deemed necessary. However, many of the crucial final details still need to be worked out between the nations contributing to the mission to ensure that all the necessary means are in place. "Given the critical situation on the ground, I expect immediate action on the resolution's provisions," said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

United Nations says Ivory Coast shelling may be 'war crime'
Image caption More people have been leaving Abobo after the shelling The shelling of an Abidjan market by Ivory Coast security forces which killed at least 25 people may be a crime against humanity, the UN says. Allies of disputed President Laurent Gbagbo have denied UN claims they fired the shells. They landed in the district of Abobo, which is under the control of militias who back his rival, Alassane Ouattara. Mr Gbagbo refuses to step down although Mr Ouattara is widely recognised as the winner of last year's poll. A statement from the UN mission in Ivory Coast says that about 100 people were killed or maimed by at least six 81mm mortar shells. "Such an act, perpetrated against civilians, could constitute a crime against humanity," it says. But Ahoua Don Mello, a spokesman for Mr Gbagbo's government, told the AFP news agency the accusations against the security forces were part of a "conspiracy" between the UN, Mr Ouattara's supporters and former colonial power France to oust Mr Gbagbo. He also accused regional powerhouse Nigeria of transporting 500 mercenaries to pro-Ouattara forces based in the northern town of Bouake. 'Strong signal' Pro-Gbagbo forces have been accused of firing at peaceful demonstrators on several occasions recently.

'Worst song of all time' becomes YouTube sensation
Black has shot to fame in the last seven days after her song, Friday , spread virally across Facebook , YouTube and Twitter . The teenager was sent by her parents to the Ark Music Factory, a Hollywood-based firm that offers parents the opportunity to turn their children into stars. The company wrote the song for Black, which has since been heavily insulted by millions of people around the world across sites such as Twitter and Facebook. Time.com, the online edition of Time magazine, called the song which talks about life from a teenage girl’s point of view, “ a train wreck ” and “a whole new level of bad”. Since the song was released on March 14, Black has become a trending topic on Twitter and had her music video watched on YouTube more than 29 million times, at the time of writing. She shot past fellow teen sensation Justin Bieber in the iTunes singles download chart at the weekend, reaching a high of 19 in the US version of the chart. There is already a Wikipedia entry covering Black and her highly-debated single, Friday. Ark Music chief, Clarence Jey, gave Black the option to remove her music video from YouTube, as the comments across social media sites like Twitter, grew increasingly more hateful. However, she decided against it. Black told The Daily Beast: “I decided not to give the haters the satisfaction that they got me so bad I gave up… Those hurtful comments really shocked me. Black's song Friday is at number 25 - four places above Justin Bieber 's track Never Say Never .

U.S. fighter jet crashes in Libya
The two crew members on the F-15E fighter jet both ejected, suffering minor injuries. The other is said to be "safe" after being rescued by Libyan rebels. The US miltary said their forces were in the process of having him recovered. The crashed plane was discovered by a Telegraph journalist reporting in and around Benghazi, the rebel-held city. It is thought the F-15E fighter jet came to ground after suffering a mechanical failure. The US military confirmed that one of its jets had crash landed but said that it had not been shot down. Vince Crawley, a spokesman for the US military's Africa Command, said that one crewman had been recovered and one was "in process of recovery". He declined to give the location of the incident and also would not say how the rescued crewman was picked up. This is the first coalition aircraft to have crash landed during the Libyan conflict following the third night of air strikes. Later, Ministry of Defence spokesman Major General John Lorimer said that the allied operations had stopped Col Gaddafi's assault on Benghazi in its tracks. He said that RAF Tornados yesterday flew a reconnaissance sortie to look out for signs of Col Gaddafi's ground troops threatening Libyan civilians, before joining Typhoons at Gioia del Colle on completion of their flight. The Typhoon patrol of the no-fly zone yesterday was the first time the RAF has used the plane in enemy airspace, he added.

Petition urges Apple to remove 'anti-gay' app
Apple is today accused of anti-gay discrimination, following the release of an iPhone app that aims to help people find “freedom from homosexuality”. A petition has been launched by Truth Wins Out, which describes itself as a non-profit organisation that fights anti-gay religious extremism on the change.org website, asking Steve Jobs to intervene to remove the app. The app is the work of the Exodus International ministry. In a letter which those supporting their petition sign up to receive, they write: "Apple has long been a friend of the LGBT community, opposing California's Proposition 8, removing the anti-gay Manhattan Declaration iPhone app, and earning a 100% score from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index. "I am shocked that this same company has given the green light to an app from a notoriously anti-gay organization like Exodus International that uses scare tactics, misinformation, stereotypes and distortions of LGBT life to recruit clients, endorses the use of so-called 'reparative therapy' to 'change' the sexual orientation of their clients." According to TWO, "reparative therapy" has been roundly condemned by every major professional medical organisation. The petition launched last week and has already attracted some 17,000 signatures: however, as word of the app spreads, the rate at which individuals are signing up appears to be snowballing. Exodus International claims to be "the world’s largest ministry to individuals and families impacted by homosexuality". On its site, Exodus states that it "upholds heterosexuality as God’s creative intent for humanity, and subsequently views homosexual expression as outside of God’s will". They conclude: "This application is designed to be a useful resource for men, women, parents, students, and ministry leaders." Describing the app as "unacceptable", and requesting its immediate removal, they warn Apple: "Your company would never allow a racist or anti-Semitic app to be sold in the iTunes store, and for good reason.

Bomb on Jerusalem bus kills one, over 30 injured
A bomb exploded Wednesday at a crowded bus stop outside the International Convention Center in Jerusalem, just opposite the central bus station. A 59-year-old woman was killed and at least 30 people were wounded in the incident, three of them seriously. All of the casualties have been evacuated to the Hadassah Hospital in Ein Karem. Israel rescue workers and paramedics work at site of explosion at a bus stop in Jerusalem, Wednesday, March 23, 2011. AP The blast could be heard throughout Jerusalem and blew out the windows of bus No. The explosive device was apparently hidden in a bag next to a telephone pole. An owner of a kiosk near the scene of the bombing called the police moments before the blast to report a suspicious object near the bus station, and during the phone conversation the bomb exploded. An eyewitness in the area at the time of the explosion told Haaretz that she heard a loud blast close to the central bus station and second later sirens began to wail and security forces rushed to the scene.

US President Obama considering supplying arms to Libyan rebels
AP LONDON - Libya's rebels have been badly beaten back over the past two days by a far better-armed force backing Col. Muammar Qaddafi. They have lost the momentum gained over the weekend under cover of fierce NATO bombing against Qaddafi's military hardware. Now, President Obama is being forced to grapple with a decision on whether to provide the rag-tag rebels with U.S. weaponry -- a decision which could quickly divide the cautious international military coalition operating over and around Libya, and could even backfire in more dramatic fashion further down the road. NATO's top commander conceded Tuesday that there were "flickers" of al Qaeda and Hezbollah amongst the rebels fighting on the ground. The fighters' long-term interests in seeing democracy rise in the north African nation remain questionable. President Obama told CBS News in an interview aired Tuesday night that the few rebel leaders American officials have met were "fully vetted, so we have a clear sense of who they are, and so far they're saying the right things, and most of them are professionals, lawyers, doctors, people who appear to be credible." Obama on U.S. strategy in Libya Obama: Qaddafi's "days are numbered" Complete coverage: Anger in the Arab World With historical perspective, one might ask how "vetted" and "credible" the rebels in Afghanistan appeared to the U.S. government which armed them against the occupying Soviet forces in the 1980s. Those rebels, known as the Mujahideen, became the Taliban and al Qaeda-linked militants presently fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Mr. Obama acknowledged in the interview with CBS News' Erica Hill that, just because some of Libya's rebel leaders seem legitimate, "that doesn't mean that all the people, among all the people who opposed Qaddafi, there might not be elements that are unfriendly to the United States and our interests. What the President would not say, however, is what one foot in Libya will look like in the coming days and weeks. Mr. Obama never ruled out the possibility of arming the rebels. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile, told reporters in London at an international strategy session on Libya that America's "interpretation" of the most recent United Nation's mandate on the Libya conflict was that it made arming the rebels legal. AP "It is our interpretation that (UN Security Council Resolution) 1973 amended or overrode the absolute prohibition of arms to Libya," she said.

British haulage managing director Edward Stobart dies at age 56
Image caption Edward Stobart (r) sold the firm to his brother in 2004 Haulage magnate Edward Stobart, who built up the Eddie Stobart lorry empire and ran it for more than 30 years, has died at the age of 56. He suffered what were described as "heart problems" on Wednesday and died on Thursday in hospital in Coventry. He took the business started by his father Eddie and built it into the best known haulage company in the UK. Mr Stobart sold the firm to his brother William and business partner Andrew Tinkler in 2004. In the 1970s Eddie Stobart took the company from a local firm delivering fertiliser into a road transport and warehousing company. Drivers wore collars and ties, which was unusual at the time, and were also instructed to wave back and honk their horn when signalled by a passer-by. By the 1990s the distinctive trucks, with each cabin bearing a woman's name, were a common sight on motorways across the UK and Europe. 'Massive loss' The firm even set up its own fan club, which now has more than 25,000 members. Ann Preston, chair of haulage company, Preston's of Potto, paid tribute to what she described as a "very, very kind man". "He was very passionate about road transport," she said. "He's a massive loss, he's definitely the most iconic figure that has ever been in this industry."

UN workers killed by Afghans over burning of a Qur'an in Florida
At least 20 UN staff members were killed in northern Afghanistan when a protest over a Quran burning overseen by pastor Terry Jones turned into a violent mob. Afghans shout anti- US slogans, behind a row of policemen, during a demonstration in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Friday, April 1. An Afghan mob apparently angry over a Quran burning in Florida set upon a United Nations compound Friday, killing as many as 20 employees and setting fire to several compound buildings. The attack, which may be the deadliest assault on the UN in Afghanistan, grew out of a protest in response to news that US pastor Terry Jones oversaw a Quran burning on March 20. Mr. Jones drew worldwide criticism last year for threatening to burn Qurans on the anniversary of 9/11. The UN is still assessing the scope of damage and determining the exact death toll at its offices in Mazir-e-Sharif, a typically quiet city in northern Afghanistan. “In general you can easily rally people around issues such as insulting the Koran and insulting the prophet," says Martine van Bijlert, codirector of the Afghanistan Analysts Network. "But other than that I think there is also an increasing tension and annoyance with the international presence and so a demonstration like that does get mixed up with more general suspicions about the intentions of the internationals.” Today's violence came after two or three hours of protests over the Florida Quran burning, which was broadcast online. Demonstrators started throwing stones at the UN compound then attempted to climb its walls and attacked guards. Afghanistan saw several protests when Mr. Jones previously planned to burn the Koran on the anniversary of 9/11 last year. The controversial pastor of Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Fla., decided not to go through with it at the time, largely due to a phone call from top Afghanistan commander US Gen. David Petraeus, who warned that the defamation of the Quran would likely cost the lives of US service men and women Afghanistan.

Wreckage, victims of Air France Flight 447 found
Paris (CNN) -- A leader of a group for families of those lost in the crash of an Air France jet said Tuesday that despite the discovery of their remains on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, he wants the bodies of his loved ones left where they are. "For me, personally I would like to leave the bodies of my children, my two children, on the seabed," said Robert Soulas, vice president of a support group for the families of the 228 people on the flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris that crashed in stormy weather on June 1, 2009. French officials announced Monday that the bulk of the wreckage was found with bodies still aboard. Only 50 bodies and scattered debris had been recovered on the surface after the crash. The human remains will be brought to the surface and identified, French Ecology and Transportation Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet said. Q&A: Will the Air Fance mystery ever be solved? Soulas said his children "died there, so I think it will be much more difficult for us to reopen a new trauma, to reopen a hardship and to plan for a grave and so on, and I think it will be a new trauma for us. So I would prefer to leave the bodies under the water." But the flight data recorders have not been recovered, leaving investigators as puzzled as ever about why the crash happened. "It's still a jigsaw puzzle," said Alain Bouillard, who will be in charge of the recovery operation. It is impossible to tell how many bodies remain in the wreck, he added. The debris is dispersed over "quite a compact area" of about 600 meters by 200 meters (1,960 feet by about 650 feet), he said.

Indian activist begins "fast-unto-death" hunger strike to end corruption
Anti-corruption campaigner says he will continue to 'fast until death' as campaign inspires millions to stage their own protests A 73-year-old Indian anti-corruption campaigner has refused to end his "fast until death" despite government concessions on his demands for a powerful new body to stamp out graft in the country. Anna Hazare ended his third day of hunger strike on Thursday saying he had lost weight and "felt a little weak" but could continue without food for at least another week. Hunger strikes – which invoke the memory of those undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi – are popular political tactics in India and are frequent features of public life. Hazare's Facebook page has more than 80,000 friends and supporters mobbed the Jantar Mantar observatory, the site of his hunger strike, in central Delhi on Thursday. Tens of thousands also joined the protests, ranging from hunger strikes to candlelit vigils in cities around the country including Mumbai, Lucknow and Jaipur. A number of Bollywood stars have also come out in support of Hazare, a former soldier and veteran social activist. Corruption in India is endemic and ranges from the small fees that need to be paid to avoid fines for trumped up traffic offences to an alleged £24bn fraud in the telecoms sector, which saw a former government minister jailed last month. "This is a corrupt government, full of corrupt ministers in a corrupt country. We have had enough," said Peta Singh, an 18-year-old student from Noida, a satellite town of Delhi, who had travelled to the centre of the capital with friends to demonstrate. Others included alleged kickbacks connected with the hugely expensive 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games. The protesters want speedy adoption of a law to create a powerful anti-corruption ombudsman which would be able to ensure rapid investigation and prosecution of offenders.

British seaman appears in court, charged with murder after shooting on nuclear submarine
Image caption Lt Cdr Ian Molyneux was shot dead A sailor charged with murder and three counts of attempted murder after a shooting on board a nuclear submarine has appeared in court. Lt Cdr Ian Molyneux, 36, of Wigan, Greater Manchester, was shot dead on HMS Astute while it was docked in Southampton on 8 April. A second man, Lt Cdr Christopher Hodge, was also shot and remains in hospital. Able Seaman Ryan Samuel Donovan, 22, appeared at the city's magistrates' court and was remanded in custody. The Royal Navy serviceman, has also been charged with the attempted murders of Petty Officer Christopher Brown, 36, Chief Petty Officer David McCoy, 37, and Lt Cdr Hodge, 45. He is due to appear at Winchester Crown Court on Wednesday. The charges follow an incident last Friday in which shots were fired from an SA80 rifle as local dignitaries, including the city council's mayor, chief executive and leader, were being given a tour of HMS Astute. 'Utterly devoted' Nick Hawkins, prosecuting, said that the case could have been handled internally by the armed forces but it had been agreed that the case would be held in the civilian courts. Mr Hawkins, the chief prosecutor for Hampshire Crown Prosecution Service, said: "Because the defendant is a serviceman he also falls under the jurisdiction of the Armed Forces. "The Armed Forces do have jurisdiction but during the course of the weekend I had discussions with the director of service prosecutions and we are in agreement this case is to be properly tried in the civilian courts." Image caption The submarine has been berthed at the Eastern Docks since Wednesday Lt Cdr Molyneux's widow, Gillian, described the father of four as "utterly devoted to his family". The submarine has been berthed at the Eastern Docks since Wednesday on a five-day official visit.

Crisis at stricken Japan nuclear plant escalates to level of Chernobyl; six killed in aftershock
Japanese nuclear regulatory officials Tuesday raised the severity rating at the earthquake- and tsunami-damaged Fukushima Daiichi power plant to the highest level by international standards, equaling the 1986 Chernobyl meltdown in the former Soviet Union. The country's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency announced that because of the amount of radioactive material released from the plant after the magnitude 9 earthquake a month ago, the rating would be changed to level 7, a "major accident" on the International Atomic Energy Agency's scale, up from a level 5, an "accident with wider consequences." Photos: Covering the Japan earthquake aftermath In a nationally televised news conference, the agency's spokesman, Hidehiko Nishiyama, said the decision was based on the amount of radioactive iodine and cesium spewed from the power plant in Fukushima, north of Tokyo. Nishiyama stressed that the radiation from the Fukushima nuclear plant was 10% of the amount at Chernobyl. He also said that unlike at Chernobyl, there had been no deaths linked to the accident at Fukushima. "At Chernobyl, the reactor itself exploded," he said. "At Fukushima some radioactivity has leaked from the reactor, but the reactor itself continues to keep most of the radioactive material inside. In that sense, this is different from Chernobyl." Before the rating was elevated, the disaster had been rated at the same level as the 1979 Three Mile Island accident near Middletown, Pa. But Minoru Ogoda of Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said the change in the severity rating came because "the impact of radiation leaks has been widespread from the air, vegetables, tap water and the ocean," the Associated Press reported. Officials said the rating reflects the severity of the problem at the outset, when radiation levels were highest.

Gbagbo detained by opposition forces and taken to meet Ouattara in Ivory Coast hotel
0156: Many were expecting the image of a dead Osama Bin Laden to be released - in much the same way as the pictures of Uday and Qusay Hussein in 2003 - to prove his death. That could all have been undone with the release of photographs, and many doubters in any case would have found reason not to believe in their authenticity, he adds. PARIS, April 11 (Reuters) - Forces loyal to Ivory Coast's Alassane Ouattara have taken Laurent Gbagbo to the Golf Hotel in Abidjan, after he was detained in his residence, a Ouattara spokesman in France told Reuters. Separately, a French defence ministry official confirmed to Reuters that Gbagbo had been detained in his residence. He said he was arrested by Ouattara's forces, backed by U.N. peacekeepers and French forces. "He's been taken to the Golf Hotel," Herve Cohx, a political adviser and spokesman, told Reuters.

Bob Dylan plays first concert in Vietnam
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhuanet) -- After nearly five decades of singing about a war that continues to haunt a generation of Americans, legendary performer Bob Dylan finally got his chance to see Vietnam at peace. The American folk singer and songwriter gave a special concert Sunday in Ho Chi Minh City. 69-year old Dylan, jammed on stage in a black jacket, purple shirt and white hat in the warm evening air, singing favorites such as "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" and "Highway 61 Revisited." Dylan's music during that tumultuous era helped define a generation, touching thousands of young people who took to the streets demanding that Washington stop the war in Vietnam. The concert's promoter has said that about half of the 8-thousand seats at Ho Chi Minh City's RMIT University were sold to a mix of young and old fans. Bob Dylan played his first ever concert in Vietnam on Sunday, following two unprovocative gigs in China. Four decades after his songs became anthems for America's anti-Vietnam war movement, the folk legend appeared at a half-empty venue in Ho Chi Minh City. Although thousands of locals and ex-pats bought tickets for the concert, around half the tickets went unsold, according to the Associated Press. The singer is not well known among Vietnamese youth, the BBC reports, and half of the country's 87 million people are under 30. As in China, where Dylan appeared in Beijing and Shanghai last week, the 69-year-old had to vet his setlist with government officials. Vietnam's communist government does not often welcome major western acts, and maintains stringent controls over what music they perform.

Mubarak arrested in Egypt ahead of corruption probe
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters gathering outside the hospital in Sharm el-Sheikh have demanded Mr Mubarak be tried Egypt's prosecutor general has ordered the detention of former President Hosni Mubarak, ahead of an investigation into corruption and abuse allegations. He is said to be in an "unstable condition" in hospital with heart problems. He has been ordered to be detained for 15 days. His sons Alaa and Gamal have also been detained amid allegations of corruption and violence, police say. Mr Mubarak stood down in February after a popular uprising against his rule. Suspicion Since then, tens of thousands of protesters have staged weekly Friday protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square. They want the ousted president to be put on trial for the deaths of protesters and alleged abuse of power during his 30-year rule. Official records show that 360 people were killed during the protests, but rights groups put the figure at about 800 dead and hundreds more wounded. Analysis It is hard to separate facts from myths in the debate about the Mubarak family's wealth and how it was obtained. It is not even clear how rich they are - estimates range from $1bn (£0.6bn) all the way up to $70bn. In the last 30 years, large tracts of empty, sometimes desert, land around major cities has been converted into valuable real estate. It is claimed the Mubarak family were given kickbacks in return for using their influence so that property developers acquired what become vast sites for free or almost free of charge.

Japanese nuclear plant operators ordered to compensate affected families amid calls for prime minister to resign
Tokyo (CNN) -- The owners of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi power plant must start paying up to 1 million yen ($12,000) per household to residents displaced or forced indoors by the nuclear accident there, Japan's government ordered Friday. The Tokyo Electric Power Company will start handing out checks "as smoothly and as early as possible," hopefully by April 28, its president, Masataka Shimizu, told reporters. Sole residents will receive 750,000 yen and multi-person households will get 1 million, Shimizu said, with the company's interim cost estimated at about $600 million. A government committee ordered the payments as an advance on the compensation that Tokyo Electric will owe nearby residents and businesses for the month-old crisis at Fukushima Daiichi, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said Friday. Edano said the government hopes to have payments in residents' hands by Japan's "Golden Week," a string of national holidays that begins April 29. Tokyo Electric offered a token payment to residents of 10 municipalities around the plant in early April. But officials in one of those towns, Namie, rejected the offer, saying it amounted to about $12 for each of its roughly 20,000 residents. The Japanese government has agreed to support the company to keep power flowing to its 25 million customers without big rate increases, Deputy Finance Minister Fumihiko Igarashi told CNN, but he said a government takeover of the utility was unlikely. "The way the government will approach that is still in the decision process," Igarashi said. About 78,000 people living within 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) of the plant were ordered out of their homes in the days after the March 11 accident, which now is ranked at the top of the international scale for nuclear disasters. Those living another 10 kilometers out were told to remain indoors as the plant belched radioactive particles into the environment from three damaged reactors. Monday, Japanese authorities told residents of five municipalities in that outer belt and beyond to evacuate within a month, due to lower levels of radioactive contamination that are likely to pose a long-term health hazard.

Syrian protests met with crackdown
Witnesses say security forces fired tear gas at protesters marching towards central Damascus from the suburb of Douma. Syrian security forces have dispersed thousands of protesters marching towards central Damascus from the suburb of Douma, witnesses say. Haitham al-Maleh, an activist and lawyer, told Al Jazeera on Friday that protesters were close to Abasyeen Square when the intelligence services brought several buses carrying men with "pistols and sticks" who attacked protesters. Other sources said security forces used tear gas to disperse the crowds. "I counted 15 mukhabarat [secret police] busloads. They went into the alleyways just north of the square chasing protesters and yelling 'You pimps, you infiltrators, you want freedom? '," a witness told Reuters news agency. Elsewhere in the capital, violence reportedly erupted when dozens of armed men in plainclothes surrounded about 250 protesters rallying in front of the Salam mosque in Barzeh district. "It's a completely different scene from last Friday when more than 26 people were killed during protests and clashes with the security forces and protesters here.

UK newspapers face libel, privacy action over murder coverage
The landlord arrested on suspicion of murdering the Bristol woman Joanna Yeates has launched legal action against a number of newspapers. Chris Jefferies, a former public school teacher, 66, was questioned for several days over the murder of his neighbour in Bristol before being released from police bail without charge last month. He has started libel and privacy claims against The Sun, the Daily Mirror, the Daily Mail, the Daily Express, the Daily Star and the Daily Record over articles published in December and January, his lawyers said. Further claims are expected to be launched against local newspapers over the next few weeks. A statement on behalf of his legal team reads: "Mr Jefferies will not be making any statement about these claims until their conclusion, which he hopes will be in the very near future." Mr Jefferies is represented by Louis Charalambous, of Simons Muirhead and Burton, who won £600,000 libel damages for Robert Murat after he was falsely accused of involvement in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Six newspapers are being sued for libel and invasion of privacy by Christopher Jefferies, the man arrested in December last year by police investigating the murder of Joanna Yeates in Bristol. His lawyer, Louis Charalambous, said in a press release issued this afternoon: "Mr Jefferies will be seeking vindication of his reputation for the terrible treatment he received." Jefferies, who was Yeates's landlord, was released by the police after questioning and eliminated from their inquiries.

Apple collecting location data from iPhone, iPad
LEADING THE DAY: Google’s Android platform and Apple’s iOS are both sending location data back to the companies, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Analysis from security analyst Samy Kamkar found that an Android phone transmitted a unique phone identifier back to Google along with location data. The Journal also revisited documents Apple sent to Congress last year, which said the company collects location information for location-based services. Apple is facing concerns from lawmakers and consumers over an unencrypted filed that collects time-stamped location data. It does not appear that this information is transmitted off of user devices, but the unprotected file could pose security problems in the wrong hands. AT&T, T-Mobile file with FCC: AT&T and T-Mobile made a case for their proposed merger by talking up the competition after filing paperwork with the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday. Joan Marsh, an AT&T vice president focusing on federal regulatory affairs, said that the mobile market is competitive and that AT&T and T-Mobile both face serious spectrum issues that the merger could address. Smaller cellular companies and consumer advocates released statements Thursday in the wake of the filing, voicing antitrust concerns.

U.S. Coast Guard investigation finds 'poor safety culture' contributed to Deepwater Horizon disaster
Image caption Deepwater Horizon owner Transocean was drilling an oil well for BP when the explosion occurred A lax safety culture and poorly working kit aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig contributed to last year's explosion, the US Coast Guard says. In a report on the incident, which killed 11 and caused a massive spill, the agency criticised the practices and training of rig owner Transocean. It said equipment was poorly maintained and alarms and automatic shutdown systems did not work properly. In a 288-page report released just over a year after the accident, the Coast Guard found actions by Transocean and the oil rig crew hindered their ability to prevent or contain the disaster. "Collectively, this record raises serious questions whether Transocean's safety culture was a factor that contributed to the disaster." 'Lax oversight' Transocean spokesman Brian Kennedy told the Associated Press that the Coast Guard had inspected the Deepwater Horizon seven months before the blowout and deemed it in compliance with safety standards. "We strongly disagree with - and documentary evidence in the Coast Guard's possession refutes - key findings in this report," he said in a statement. In the months that followed, more than 200 million gallons (780 million litres) of oil flowed in the Gulf of Mexico from the well, soiling hundreds of miles of coastline in the worst US oil spill in history. It said national regulators had effectively "abdicated" their inspection responsibilities by contracting them out to third parties. Crew 'complacent' The Coast Guard report said evidence indicated the explosion occurred when electrical equipment ignited a cloud of flammable gas that had flowed up from the well. It said electrical equipment may have been incapable of preventing ignition, and cited a 2010 inspection audit that found some equipment on board was in "bad condition" and was "seriously corroded".

Sixteen killed in Marrakech, Morocco bomb blast
Thursday's bombing in a popular Morocco tourist spot killed at least 16, and could give Moroccan leaders reason to halt reform efforts instigated by prodemocracy protests. A police officer stands outside a cordon off building after an explosion ripped through a cafe popular among foreign tourists in the Moroccan city of Marrakech, Morocco, Thursday, April, 28, killing and wounding people in what the government called a suspected criminal act. While no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, security experts told Reuters that it bore similarities to previous attacks by Islamic militants. It is the first suicide attack since 2003, when suicide bombers killed 45 people, including themselves, in Casablanca. The square is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the top visitor spots in a country that relies heavily on tourism revenue – according to Reuters, it is the country's second largest industry, after agriculture. "You can't find a more emblematic target than Jamaa-el-Fnaa square," a restaurant owner told the Guardian. The North African Al Qaeda affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), is active in neighboring Algeria, but Morocco has been largely quiet since the 2003 attacks in Casablanca. A chief concern of the Moroccan government is that AQIM will eventually expand beyond Algeria and the Sahara desert and establish a base in Morocco, which it has so far failed to do, Reuters reports.

World leaders react to death of Osama bin Laden
The United States put its diplomatic facilities around the world on high alert and issued a global travel warning for Americans. Afghan President Hamid Karzai Karzai said he hopes the world believes that his country is "not the place of terrorism" after the announcement that the al Qaeda leader was killed in neighboring Pakistan. "If the international troops/forces are true allies of the Afghans -- they should come out and say that the killing of Afghans, children and elders which took place over the many years on a daily basis was not a good idea," Karzai said on RTA TV. Afghan opposition leader Abdullah Abdullah, Hope and Change Bin Laden's killing proves that Pakistan is a "haven" for terror groups, according to Abdullah. "Killing of Osama bin Laden is pleasant news for Afghans, and now it's proven that al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are not based in Afghanistan and Pakistan is a haven for them," he said. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard Gillard congratulated the U.S. on the operation, and said she acknowledges the role of Pakistan in the fight against terror. "Our fight against terrorism does not end with bin Laden's death. We must remain vigilant against the threat posed by al Qaeda and the groups it has inspired," she said. "We will continue our support for the counterterrorism efforts of the United States and our partners, and we will continue our efforts in Afghanistan to ensure that the country never again becomes a safe haven for terrorism."

U.S. did not inform Pakistan of bin Laden mission because of suspicions he was being harbored by government
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US Attorney General Eric Holder: "His killing was appropriate" The US attorney general has said al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was a lawful military target whose killing was "an act of national self-defence". Eric Holder told a Senate committee that Bin Laden had made no attempt to surrender. The US has acknowledged that Bin Laden was unarmed when shot dead in Monday's raid by US special forces in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the White House has decided not to release photos of the dead Bin Laden. "If he had surrendered, attempted to surrender, I think we should obviously have accepted that, but there was no indication that he wanted to do that and therefore his killing was appropriate," Mr Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Al-Qaeda says bin Laden death will 'not be wasted'; Pentagon releases videos of terrorist leader in compound
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner on the significance of the new material The Pentagon has released home videos of Osama Bin Laden, seized at the secret Pakistani compound where he was shot dead by US commandos. The tapes show him watching himself on television, and preparing a video message addressed to the US. At a news briefing in Washington, intelligence officials said Bin Laden had been actively leading al-Qaeda from the compound in Abbottabad. Five videos seized during Monday's raid have been released. Rehearsals In the first video, Bin Laden is shown wearing a white skullcap and shirt and a golden robe. Analysis Of the five clips released by the Pentagon, and said by them to have been seized from Bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, only one is truly remarkable. It appears to show an aged and frail Bin Laden squatting on the floor of a very basic room with jerry-rigged electrical wiring, watching television. There is nothing glamorous about his surroundings, which resemble an urban squat. Yet a senior but unnamed US intelligence official has told journalists in Washington they now believe the compound raided by US Navy Seals last Monday was an al-Qaeda command and control centre. If they're right then the idea of Bin Laden being too busy evading capture to get involved in operations all this time will turn out to be badly wrong. But Noman Benotman, who knew Bin Laden personally up til 2000, tells me this is wrong, that Bin Laden was a spiritual leader but in no way a military commander. Pentagon officials have removed audio from the film, citing security concerns, but said it was a message to the United States.

UK holds referendum on voting system
Image caption It was clear early on that the No campaign were heading for victory The UK has voted overwhelmingly to reject changing the way MPs are elected - dealing a bitter blow to Nick Clegg on top of heavy Lib Dem poll losses. Officials say 19.1m people voted in the second UK-wide referendum in history - a higher than expected turnout of 41%. The final result put the Yes vote at 32.1% and the No vote at 67.9%. It comes as the Lib Dems suffered a rout in English local elections - and the SNP scored an historic victory in the Scottish Parliament poll. Alex Salmond's party will form a majority government- humbling Labour in one of its traditional heartlands and paving the way for a referendum on Scottish independence. 'Clear result' Labour made significant gains in town halls in the north of England and in the Welsh assembly elections,it fell just short of an absolute majority. Labour also held Leicester South in a Parliamentary by-election with an increased majority, although the Lib Dems hung on to second place. A debate that was often about the complexity of electoral systems ended in the simplest of results. Those who favoured the Yes campaign will argue they were defeated by the Prime Minister's campaigning power, a largely hostile press and a tough opposing campaign. Those who backed a No vote will say they won the argument for the merits of the status quo, and persuaded people the alternative vote was complex and unnecessary. The voters, of course, needed only to mark crosses on ballot papers.

Four U.N. staff dead after plane crash in Bolivia
Four united Nations anti-narcotics staff and two Bolivian military pilots died when their aeroplane crashed in the west of the country. The Bolivian air force said the Cessna, missing since Thursday, had been flying over the main coca-growing area in Los Yungas when it hit a tree. The four UN staff worked for the Office on Drugs and Crime, monitoring the production of coca – the key ingredient of cocaine. The aircraft was found on Saturday in a remote region of Inquisivi, about 75 miles from the capital, La Paz. (CNN) -- A Bolivian Air Force plane missing since Thursday crashed in a remote, mountainous area, killing two pilots and four United Nations workers, a U.N. official said Saturday. A day earlier, a local mayor claimed to have found the plane and its passengers safe and sound, but the Air Force on Saturday found the wreckage, confirming that that was not the case. "The plane was completely destroyed and burned," Robert Brockmann, spokesman for the U.N. field office in Bolivia, told CNN. The plane was found northeast of La Paz, the capital, in an overgrown area with steep cliffs, Brockmann said. The closest village to the site of the wreckage is La Merced, though it was not easily accessible, he said.

IMF head remains in New York prison; charged over alleged hotel sex attack
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who denies the charges, remanded in custody in New York over fears he might flee the US A New York judge has ordered the head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, to be remanded in custody after prosecutors expressed fears that he might flee to France to escape charges of sexually assaulting a hotel maid. The judge, Melissa Jackson, refused a request for bail, agreeing that Strauss-Kahn, who was pulled off a Paris-bound plane on Saturday and charged with a criminal sexual act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment, represented a flight risk. His defence lawyers said Strauss-Kahn denied the charges, and one of them, Ben Brafman, said it was "quite likely he will be exonerated". Earlier they said Strauss-Kahn had agreed to undergo scientific and forensic tests and intends to "vigorously" defend himself. The prosecution on Monday compared Strauss-Kahn to Roman Polanski, the film director who fled the US in 1978 after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with an underage girl. Prosecutors said they were investigating an additional incident, without specifying what it related to, and that they were waiting for the forensic information from the hotel. The defence offered $1m (£618,000) bail and said the IMF chief was prepared to reside with his daughter in Manhattan and wear an electronic bracelet. Strauss-Kahn appeared tired, impassive and dishevelled at the hearing, having waited for the court to deal with a string of more mundane cases involving three men accused of minor drugs offences. The charges threaten to create a leadership vacuum at the IMF, overseer of the global economy, and throw wide open next year's French presidential election, ending the hopes of the French Socialist who was favourite to beat Nicolas Sarkozy. Strauss-Kahn was led off an Air France flight on Sunday as he headed for Europe for crunch talks with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and European finance ministers over the debt crisis. William Taylor, another of Strauss-Kahn's lawyers, said: "Our client willingly consented to scientific and forensic examinations at the request of the government."

Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigns as head of IMF
Image caption Dominique Strauss-Kahn was denied bail at a hearing on Monday International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has resigned following allegations he sexually assaulted a hotel maid in New York. In a statement, Mr Strauss-Kahn - who is being held in Rikers Island prison - said he wanted to "devote all my strength... to proving my innocence." Mr Strauss-Kahn will make a fresh application for bail later on Thursday. Whether his successor comes from the developed or developing world will be a topic of hot debate, analysts say. In the statement, Mr Strauss-Kahn said it was with "infinite sadness" that he tendered his resignation. "I think at this time first of my wife - whom I love more than anything - of my children, of my family, of my friends. He said he denied "with the greatest possible firmness" all of the allegations against him, but said he wanted to protect the IMF. The IMF said it would release information "in the near future" about appointing a successor. The organisation's deputy, John Lipsky, has been in interim control of the IMF since Mr Strauss-Kahn's arrest on Saturday. US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had led calls for him to stand down, followed by the head of the governing right-wing UMP party in France, Jean-Francois Cope, who said he couldn't see how Mr Strauss-Kahn could carry on.

EF-3 tornado strikes western Massachusetts
Taking to the air for the first time yesterday, National Weather Service meteorologists confirmed that three separate tornadoes struck Massachusetts on Wednesday afternoon, a main twister that accounted for nearly all the damage, and two smaller ones that touched down for only a few minutes each. The first and most powerful tornado struck at 4:17 p.m. in Westfield, and over the next 70 minutes reached a wind speed of 160 miles per hour and plowed a path of destruction 39 miles long and a half-mile at its widest before lifting off in Charlton at 5:27. “This storm will be noted not only for its intensity,’’ the weather service said in a new analysis released late last night, “but also for the length of the continuous damage path.’’ The weather service categorized the main twister as a category EF-3 tornado — a severe storm that packs winds of more than 135 miles per hour and is seldom seen in New England. The other two tornadoes were much briefer: one touched down around 6:30 in Wilbraham for eight minutes and covered 3.6 miles; the other, an offshoot, hit North Brimfield at 6:54 and ran 1.3 miles before lifting off three minutes later. While less intense than the primary storm, the two later twisters still reached top wind speeds of 90 miles per hour, the meteorologists added, ranking them as category EF-1 tornadoes. However, they largely struck wooded areas with most of the damage fallen or uprooted trees. Weather service officials said they decided to conduct an aerial survey yesterday after being unable to document the tornadoes’ trail through woods and determine the end points. “We decided with such a long track, we really wanted to make sure we could get the end points and get a better idea as to the width and just how continuous the tornado was,’’ National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Thompson said by phone earlier Friday after stepping off a Civil Air Patrol plane. The Massachusetts twister pales in comparison with the monster storm that devastated Joplin, Mo., on May 22, leaving more than 130 dead. That tornado along with the three others that tore through Alabama and Mississippi on April 27 was considered a devastating EF-5 that delivered winds of more than 200 miles per hour, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. SPRINGFIELD — On Wednesday, to protect himself from the tornado he could see coming straight for him, Kevin J.

British voice artist Roy Skelton dies at age 79
Created by Pamela Lonsdale for pre-school children and presented for most of its run by Geoffrey Hayes, Rainbow centred around the antics of Zippy, a loud-mouthed creature of indeterminate species with a rugby ball for a head and a zip for a mouth; George, a shy, pink and slightly camp hippopotamus; and Bungle, a nosy brown bear (played by John Leeson, then Stanley Bates). The episodes usually involved some kind of squabble between the puppet characters and Geoffrey Hayes’s attempts to calm them down. Skelton joined the ITV show in the 1970s, performing Zippy and George for 22 years until it came to an end in 1992; he also wrote many of the scripts. He claimed to have based the voice of the domineering Zippy on a cross between Margaret Thatcher and Ian Paisley and remembered many hilarious moments — “like when Bungle had a terrible wind problem and tried to blame everyone else”. Hayes recalled Skelton as being particularly good when Zippy and George were having an argument: “It sounded like he’d double-tracked it as they seemed to be talking over each other. ” Although Skelton’s voices were familiar to millions, as his real identity remained hidden behind layers of cardboard, foam and fur, he never became a celebrity. “I can walk down the street and no one knows who I am,” he told an interviewer.

US Representative Anthony Weiner resigns over sexual conduct
AP Photo/Seth Wenig After much speculation, Huma Abedin did not appear at husband Anthony Weiner's side as he resigned from Congress on Thursday afternoon. The outgoing N.Y. Democrat resigned nearly three weeks after the revelation that he had been sending a number of women lewd pictures of himself on the Internet. Weiner apologized to Abedin during his resignation speech, and expressed the hope that "my wife and I can continue to heal from the damage I have caused." Abedin, who was seen entering the couple's home in Queens before the press conference, married Weiner last year in a ceremony officiated by Former President Bill Clinton. According to reports, the couple is expecting their first child. Video: Weiner resigns amidst applause, jokes Pictures: Anthony Weiner The scandal had become a distraction for House Democrats, who had raised pressure on Weiner to resign in recent days after he admitted June 6 to exchanging lewd photos and messages with women he met online. Weiner late Wednesday told House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of his plan to step down Thursday, two Democratic aides told CBS News. Many speculated that Weiner held off on making a decision until Abedin, an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, returned from an overseas trip. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi appeared Thursday at what she noted was her regularly scheduled weekly press availability -- the topic was jobs -- and said if there were questions on Weiner: "I won't be answering any." She said she would have an additional statement after Weiner's own press conference later Thursday. Photos: Rep.

Massive flooding in China; over 550 thousand evacuated
Young boys row on tyre tubes along a flooded street in Leping, Jiangxi province June 16, 2011. Torrential rains are still ravaging central and southern China, nearly two weeks after leaving at least 105 people dead and 65 missing, the state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday. REUTERS/Stringer A woman stands on the roof of her house as she looks at the flooded village of Moshan Cun, Zhejiang province June 17, 2011. REUTERS/Carlos Barria ZHUJI, China China has mobilized troops to help with flood relief and raised its disaster alert to the highest level after days of downpours forced the evacuation of more than half a million people in central and southern provinces. The official China Daily said more than 555,000 people had been evacuated in seven provinces and a municipality after rains in recently drought-stricken areas caused floods and mudslides in the Yangtze River basin. Central authorities have raised the disaster alert to the highest level 4, and the government is describing the floods in some areas, such as eastern Zhejiang province's Qianting River area, as the worst since 1955. Local media said two dykes in the village areas of Zhuji in Zhejiang province were breached on Thursday, flooding two towns and 21 villages. In the flood-hit Banshan and Moshan villages on the outskirts of Zhuji, hundreds of people had been evacuated, but many have since returned to guard their homes and belongings. The first floor of her village home is completely inundated and she has moved all their belongings to the second and third floors. Other villagers said life was tough for some residents who were still trapped deep inside the village by the flood waters as aid distribution has been slow.

Soviet human rights activist Yelena Bonner dies aged 88
(CNN) -- Elena Bonner, the wife of late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov who gained worldwide acclaim after smuggling her husband's writings out of exile, died Saturday in Boston, her daughter said in a statement. Bonner's ashes are be interred at a Moscow cemetery next to her late husband's remains, said her daughter, Tatiana Yankelevich. Bonner's life revolved around the political struggles that characterized the Soviet Union in the 20th century. She joined forces with Sakharov in the early 1970's. Bonner was born in 1923 in Turkmenistan into a family of prominent Communist Party officials, according to a biography posted on Harvard University's website. Her father was killed in Stalin's purges during the "Great Terror" of the late 1930s, and her mother was interned in a gulag for 10 years. Bonner was twice wounded during World War II while serving as a nurse for the Soviet military. She became a physician after the war. She married Sakharov, known for his work on the development of the atomic bomb for the Soviet Union, in 1972, according to the Andrei Sakharov Foundation website. Following his work on the atomic bomb, Sakharov began publishing writings critical of Soviet politics. She was permitted to take trips to Moscow, which enabled her to smuggle Sakharov's critical writings on the Soviet Union out of exile. Bonner was convicted of "anti-Soviet agitation" in 1984 for smuggling Sakharov's writings and lost her travel privileges to Moscow.

Obama announces troop reductions in Afghanistan
Barack Obama has begun the long retreat from Afghanistan in a televised statement to the US, declaring success against al-Qaida and the Taliban and the withdrawal of about a third of US forces next year. Obama said 33,000 US troops would be withdrawn by the summer of 2012 or by September at the latest. The first 5,000 would return next month and another 5,000 by the end of the year. The president said that when he ordered the 33,000 extra troops to Afghanistan in 2009 they had a clear mission: to refocus on al-Qaida; reverse the Taliban's momentum; and train Afghan security forces to defend their own country. "Tonight, I can tell you that we are fulfilling that commitment," he said, adding: "We are meeting our goals." He was careful to avoid repeating George Bush's ill-fated prediction on Iraq in 2003 of "mission accomplished". He settled instead for: "We have put al-Qaida on a path to defeat." Obama claimed al-Qaida was under more pressure than at any time since the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. "This was a victory for all who have served since 9/11," he said. He addressed criticism that the US should not be spending billions on wars overseas while the country is struggling economically at home and promised to shift from foreign to domestic issues. "America, it is time to focus on nation building here at home," he said. But US and other Nato military chiefs fear that the president is taking a gamble with the scale of early drawdown, ignoring the advice of US and Nato commanders who warned that withdrawal of anything more than a few thousand in the coming months could endanger substantial gains made over the winter in the battle against the Taliban.

Former Rwandan government minister Nyiramasuhuko convicted of genocide
Mother and son given life terms for their part in assault, rape and killings in southern region of Butare A former Rwandan minister became the first woman to be convicted of genocide when she and her son were given life sentences for war crimes in the 1994 genocide. The UN international criminal tribunal for Rwanda found that Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, who was minister for family and women's affairs, and her son, Arsene Ntahobali, a former militia leader, helped to abduct hundreds of ethnic Tutsis who were assaulted, raped and killed in the southern region of Butare. They were both found guilty of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Hanna Brollowski, an international law researcher at the TMC Asser Institute in The Hague, said Nyiramasuhuko was the first woman to be convicted of genocide. Between April and June 1994 Nyiramasuhuko and Ntahobali, backed by the extremist Hutu militia known as the Interahamwe, abducted hundreds of ethnic Tutsis in Butare. "Many were physically assaulted, raped and taken away to various places in Butare, where they were killed. During the course of these repeated attacks on vulnerable civilians, both Nyiramasuhuko and Ntahobali ordered killings," said Judge William Sekule. A former mayor, Elie Ndayambaje, was also jailed for life on Friday and three other defendants were given sentences of between 25 and 35 years. The proceedings lasted more than 700 days and the court heard from nearly 180 witnesses. Nyiramasuhuko is not the only woman to be charged with genocide.

Chinese premier Wen Jiabao visits Shakespeare's birthplace

Mr Wen, who is on a three-day visit, said he wanted to welcome more UK products into China. Speaking to the BBC's business editor, Robert Peston, he also said he would like to see more enterprises based on the China-owned model used by the MG car plant at Longbridge. And he said China would continue to support the crisis-hit eurozone. China's leading automaker the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation became the owner of MG Rover's Longbridge plant after a merger in late 2007 with its smaller rival, Nanjing Automobile Group. Mr Wen visited the plant, once the site of Britain's mass-car manufacturing where a launch ceremony for the company's new sports sedan the MG6 Magnette took place. If words matter, then his declaration that it is a priority to boost consumption by the Chinese, relative to their massive saving and investment, will help to bring balance to the global economy Peston: Wen backs UK and euro Mr Wen also told the BBC it was a priority to boost consumption by the Chinese, as well as reducing its foreign trade surplus and reliance on exports. "I think these show our confidence in the economies of the European countries and the eurozone." We reached agreement on the Chinese government buying a certain amount of government debts of bonds on the Hungarian side... that is China lending a helping hand to Hungary at a time when that country is in difficulty. "We have done this for Hungary and we will do the same thing for other European countries."

Greek workers strike over austerity measures
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jon Sopel: "In one corner of Syntagma Square we have seen more violence erupting" Police have fired tear gas in running battles with stone-throwing youths in Athens, where a 48-hour general strike is being held against a parliamentary vote on tough austerity measures. Thousands of protesters gathered outside parliament in the capital where public transport ground to a halt. PM George Papandreou has said that only his 28bn-euro (£25bn) austerity plan would get Greece back on its feet. If the package is not approved, Greece could run out of money within weeks. Without a new plan in place, the EU and International Monetary Fund say they will withhold 12bn euros of loans which Greece needs to repay debts due in mid-July. The newly named IMF chief, Christine Lagarde, has urged Greek politicians to unite to avoid a debt default. "If I have a message this evening about Greece, it is a call to the Greek opposition... to join in national unity with the party which is currently in power," she told France's TF1 television station. "The country's destiny is at stake." Hundreds of protesters - their faces covered by scarves or gas-masks - started throwing stones, debris and bottles in the square at police who retaliated with tear gas and stun grenades. Two communications vans with mobile telecoms transmitters were daubed with graffiti condemning the media and banks before being set alight by protesters who had apparently mistaken them for satellite TV trucks. There were also skirmishes as trade unionists tried to persuade anarchists to leave the square, saying their violent protests were only harming the aims of the demonstrations, says the BBC's Jon Sopel in Athens.

Hundreds of thousands of British public sector workers strike over planned pension changes
Image caption More than 12,000 schools in England and Wales were affected by the strikes Thousands of UK schools closed on a day of strikes by public sector workers over pension changes. But the government said action by civil servants had had "minimal" impact with fewer than 100,000 on strike at midday. The Public and Commercial Services union said it was the best supported strike it had ever held, with 200,000 civil servants striking. Jobcentres, border controls and passport offices were also affected by the industrial action. Thousands of schools were closed across England and Wales on Thursday as teachers from three unions walked out. The government says the proposed pension changes are "fair to taxpayers" and other unions are continuing with negotiations. It condemned the strike, as did the opposition, although Labour leader Ed Miliband accused ministers of mishandling negotiations with the unions. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: "Our border controls are in place and Jobcentres and pension offices are open for business. "Indicative figures from every government department show that as of 12 noon today, over 75% of civil servants were not on strike. "This shows that less than half of PCS members decided to take strike action today." But the apparent success of a one day strike is often determined as much by spin, as by the numbers who take to the streets. The unions see today as a show of strength - the government want to suggest it was really a sign of weakness.

Murdoch axes News of the World after hacking allegations startle politicians
Sunday edition of Murdoch's tabloid to be last in the aftermath of political and commercial fallout from phone-hacking scandal News International announced on Thursday that it is closing the News of the World after this Sunday's edition, with no end in sight to the political and commercial fallout from the phone-hacking scandal after 72 hours of mounting crisis. Sunday's edition of the paper will be the last, News International chairman James Murdoch told News of the World staff on Thursday afternoon. Murdoch told employees at the 167-year-old title: "The News of the World is in the business of holding others to account. Murdoch said in a statement: "Wrongdoers turned a good newsroom bad and this was not fully understood or adequately pursued." Murdoch also conceded the company had "made statements to parliament without being in full possession of the facts. He said "the News of the World and News International wrongly maintained that these issues were confined to one reporter" and that the company had passed information to the police which would demonstrate this. Murdoch also said in his statement to staff that he had authorised out-of-court payments to victims of hacking: "I now know that I did not have a complete picture when I did so."

Polar bears related to extinct Irish bears, DNA study shows
Polar bears may have touch o' the Irish in them, a survey of their genetics over the last 120,000 years finds. Specifically, today's white polar bears show a genetic imprint that strongly suggests they may descend in part from an extinct species of Irish brown bear, and not bear populations in Alaska as was previously believed. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) depend on sea ice to hunt and breed. As the arctic warms and sea ice doesn't last as long, they're less able to find prey to feed on. When they move inland they're vulnerable to hunters and less able to hunt themselves, as their white fur makes them stand out on land. Naturalists in Canada have sighted polar/brown bear hybrids as polar bears move into areas where brown bears now live. But researchers writing in this week's edition of the journal Current Biology show that this isn't the first time that has happened. These showed that hybridization between polar bears and brown bears may have happened many times throughout the Late Pleistocene - most likely during times when the climate changed and bear populations moved and overlapped. "This suggests that interspecific hybridization not only may be more common than previously considered but may be a mechanism by which species deal with marginal habitats during periods of environmental deterioration," they conclude in their paper.

South Sudan gains independence
A day after the jubilation of South Sudan's independence proclamation, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. warned Sunday of a "real risk" that the north-south peace process could unravel unless outstanding issues such as oil and border demarcations are quickly resolved. Celebrations rang out Saturday in the South Sudan capital of Juba, the first day of independence after decades of civil war between Sudan's north and south. Some 2 million people died in the most recent war, from 1983-2005. On Sunday, the capital appeared hungover from its massive celebration, though small groups of people still sang and danced on street corners. The new country's national anthem played from speakers and cell phones. The joy of independence day temporarily overshadowed the ongoing hostilities between the northern army and southern-allied forces in the northern state of South Kordofan and other violence along the north-south border. The south and north have yet to agree on a demarcated border, and the issue of oil remains contentious. The south has most of the oil but it must move it through the north's pipes. The American delegation was led by Susan Rice, who told The Associated Press in a phone interview on Sunday that the U.S. government remains "focused on the urgency of resolving" the outstanding north-south issues. "We feel that until they are resolved, there's a real risk of the process to date beginning to unravel," she said. Rice said that the U.S. government would remain "very actively involved" in supporting negotiations between Khartoum and Juba. "As wonderful a day as yesterday (Saturday) was ... we are mindful that even as those presidents pledge a commitment to peaceful and cooperative relations, that these issues are such that in the absence of resolution there is a risk of things beginning to disintegrate," she added.

Murdoch empire in crisis after newspaper closes: BSkyB bid halted, former editor arrested, anger at chief executive
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ed Miliband: ''This bid cannot be completed...until after this criminal investigation'' Rupert Murdoch has arrived in the UK in the midst of the phone-hacking crisis, as he faces growing pressure to scrap his company's takeover bid for BSkyB. Labour leader Ed Miliband urged him to abandon the bid and also to sack News International (NI) chief Rebekah Brooks, an ex-News of the World editor. The BBC understands News International found e-mails in 2007 that appeared to show police were paid for information. News International said it was "co-operating fully with the police". The evidence of alleged criminal behaviour was not handed to the Metropolitan Police for investigation until 20 June, 2011, BBC business editor Robert Peston reported. Sources told our correspondent that the e-mails were in the possession of the firm of solicitors, Harbottle & Lewis, before being passed to detectives. He said the e-mails appear to show Andy Coulson, editor of the News of the World from 2003-2007, authorising payments to the police for help with stories. And they also appear to show that phone hacking went wider than the activities of a single rogue reporter, which News of the World claimed at the time. Image caption Rupert Murdoch arrives at Wapping to take charge of the crisis News International says James Murdoch, Rupert's son, had no knowledge of the e-mails that Harbottle & Lewis were asked to review. Rupert Murdoch flew into the country on Sunday morning and immediately went to News International's head office in east London for talks with key executives. The last edition of the News of the World was published on Sunday, with a full-page apology for hacking mobile phones of hundreds of people, including murdered teenager Milly Dowler. On Thursday, James Murdoch announced the paper would be closing down in the wake of the latest revelations and in its final editorial the paper said: "Quite simply, we lost our way". Mrs Brooks has been under pressure over staying in her role while journalists on the paper have lost their jobs. Meanwhile, Mr Miliband said he would force a Commons vote to delay News Corporation's proposed takeover of the whole of BSkyB, until the investigation into the NoW was completed.

China's consumer prices rise to a three-year high in June as food prices soar 14.4 percent
FILE - In this June 30, 2011 file photo, a sculpture of fuel nozzles stand next to gas prices at a convenience store in Lawrence, Kan. The latest readings on Chinese inflation and renewed worries about European debt are pushing oil lower Monday, July 11, 2011. (AP Photo/Orlin Wagner, file) NEW YORK (AP) — The latest readings on Chinese inflation and renewed worries about European debt are pushing oil lower. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.44 to $94.75 per barrel Monday morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, which is used to price many international oil varieties, dropped $2.41 to $115.92 per barrel on the ICE Futures exchange in London. Oil started falling early in electronic trading after a weekend announcement that inflation in China hit a three-year high in June. China has been raising interest rates in an attempt to control inflation and cool off its economy, but on Saturday the government said consumer prices continued to rise, jumping 6.4 percent last month. Rising consumer prices will heap even more pressure on the country's burgeoning economy, and that could affect energy demand. Meanwhile, European officials disagreed over a second bailout package for Greece. Uncertainty about the country's debt problems raised concerns that the economic crisis could spread to Italy and Spain. "You combine the debt crisis in Europe with those (Greece) austerity measures, and you get less spending and therefore less demand" for oil, analyst Andrew Lipow said. The dollar shot up against other currencies in morning trading, and that also weighed on oil futures. Oil is traded in dollars and tends to fall as the dollar strengthens and makes crude barrels more expensive for investors holding foreign money.

Drought stricken Somalia nears famine
Image caption Ifo II has room for up to 80,000 people Kenya has agreed to open a new refugee camp near its border with Somalia, as thousands of people flee the region's worst drought in 60 years. Prime Minister Raila Odinga said the Ifo II camp, which can fit up to 80,000 people, would open within 10 days. Some government ministers had feared opening the camp would encourage more Somalis to cross the border. Announcing the move, Mr Odinga said: "Although we consider our own security, we can't turn away the refugees." Mr Odinga had earlier visited the nearby Dadaab refugee camp, where he said the situation was unacceptable. Aid workers say conditions at the camp - which is made up of three settlements - are desperate. About 370,000 people are crammed into an area set up for 90,000 people, they say. He said Kenya had lived with the refugee crisis for 20 years and had been asking the international community for help all that time. "They are only now responding when they see people are dying. So the Kenyan government is a victim, not the accused."

Rebekah Brooks resigns from News International
News International chief stops short of full apology, saying she no longer wants to be 'focal point of the debate' Rebekah Brooks, the News International chief executive, has resigned after 11 days of mounting political pressure over the phone-hacking scandal. Brooks announced her decision to News International staff in Wapping just before 10am on Friday, saying her resignation had been accepted by Rupert and James Murdoch. She said she no longer wanted to be a "focal point of the debate" surrounding the company's future and reputation. "As chief executive of the company, I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt and I want to reiterate how sorry I am for what we now know to have taken place," Brooks said in a statement. However my desire to remain on the bridge has made me a focal point of the debate. "This is now detracting attention from all our honest endeavours to fix the problems of the past." Brooks praised Rupert and James Murdoch and said she leaves "with the happiest memories and an abundance of friends". This despite calls for her to go from the leaders of all the main political parties, including the prime minister, David Cameron, and the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, whose mobile phone was allegedly hacked by a private investigator working for the News of the World. However, the last straw may have been Thursday night's Newsnight interview with News International parent company News Corporation's second largest shareholder, Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Alsaud, in which he said that if there was evidence of Brooks's "explicit" involvement in the alleged illegal activity, "for sure she has to go, you bet she has to go". In her resignation statement she indicated that she would still appear before the committee.

Arrests and resignations as probe into Britain's phone hacking scandal widens
A former reporter at the News of the World who was the first named journalist to allege a high-ranking editor was aware of phone hacking by staffers has been found dead, the Guardian reported Monday. Sean Hoare reportedly worked on the Sun and the News of the World with Andy Coulson before he was dismissed in 2005 for problems related to drinking and drugs. He was found dead Monday morning at his Watford home, according to the Guardian's report. Coulson, who most recently served as Prime Minister David Cameron's media chief, succeeded Rebekah Brooks as editor of the News of the World in 2003. Coulson resigned from his government post in January and was arrested earlier this month in the scandal. "The death is currently being treated as unexplained, but not thought to be suspicious," according to a police statement. The New York Times first reported Hoare's allegations in an article published Sept. 1, 2010. He told the newspaper that Coulson knew of the phone hacking and actively encouraged his staff to intercept the phone calls of celebrities. Cameron has said he thought at the time he hired Coulson, who quit because of the phone-hacking scandal, that the journalist deserved a second chance.Speaking at a news conference in South Africa, Cameron said the police investigation "must go wherever the evidence leads." Hoare, once a close friend of Coulson's, told The New York Times the two men first worked together at the Sun, where, Hoare said, he played taped recordings of hacked messages for Coulson, the Guardian report.

Train accident in China kills at least 43
A child was rescued 21 hours after a crash involving two high-speed trains in eastern China killed at least 35 people and injured more than 200 others, according to reports yesterday. Xinhua news agency said the unconscious child was found in a carriage by rescuers yesterday Sunday evening. "When we found him, he could still move his hands," Xinhua quoted an unnamed firefighter as saying. China Central Television initially reported that the child was a boy, but later said it was a four-year-old girl. The child was taken to hospital but no other details were provided. The accident occurred when a bullet train travelling south from the Zhejiang provincial capital, Hangzhou, on Saturday evening lost power after a lightning strike and stalled. The first four cars of the moving train fell about 30 metres from a viaduct to the ground below. One carriage ended up in a vertical position, leaning against the viaduct. The ministry of railways said in a statement that the first four cars of the moving train and the last two of the stalled train derailed. An official surnamed Wang said it was unclear how long the first train had stopped on the track before being struck. The incident is the first derailment on China's high-speed rail network since the country launched bullet trains with a maximum speed of 155mph in 2007.

US President Obama announces deal reached to avert government default
America has moved away from the brink of a catastrophic default after a deal was reached overnight to raise its debt ceiling. Stock markets around the world briefly rallied on Monday, in relief that the world's largest economy would probably avoid running out of cash this week. But the agreement, which includes around $2.5tn (£1.5tn) of spending cuts over the next decade, has been criticised on both sides of the political divide, and will probably not save America's triple-A credit rating. There is also concern that the deal could still fail to be approved by Congress, which is due to vote on the package on Monday night. Some liberals are angry that the plan, which has been hailed as a triumph for the Tea Party movement, relies on spending reductions rather than tax rises to reduce the US budget deficit. The Democratic leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, has already warned that some congressional members in her party may be unwilling to support the deal. In return, the US government deficit will be reduced by a similar amount over the next decade. "This process has been messy and taken too long," said Obama, who also admitted that the weeks of frustratingly slow negotiations in Washington had not delivered the deal he wanted. "This compromise does make a serious downpayment on the deficit reduction we need, and gives each party a strong incentive to get a balanced plan done before the end of the year," Obama said. McConnell, who will meet with Republican senators on Monday, said: "We can assure the American people ... that the United States of America will not for the first time in our history default on its obligations."

Three killed amongst Birmingham, England riots
Image caption Haroon Jahan, Shahzad Ali and Abdul Musavir were protecting property, residents say Three men have been run over and killed as they protected property in a second night of violence in Birmingham. The men aged 31, 30 and 21 were hit by a car in Winson Green. They were taken to City Hospital where about 200 people from the Asian community gathered. Police have arrested a 32-year-old man who is being questioned on suspicion of murder following the deaths. Haroon Jahan, 21, Shahzad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, were taken to hospital but died from their injuries. West Midlands Police Chief Constable Chris Sims said the incident happened when a group of males had been gathered close to a petrol station in Dudley Road. "At some point, and in circumstances that as yet I can't fully explain, a vehicle has been driven into that group of males, which tragically has led to three of those men losing their lives," he said. 'Covered in blood' Referring to the arrest he said: "He has been arrested for murder because the information that we have at the moment would support the idea the car was deliberately driven."

Texas governor Rick Perry to announce his presidential intentions
Rick Perry has a presidential-election infrastructure ready to go, say insiders. His appeal to Christian conservatives and the business community position him as a strong, if late, challenger. Rick Perry gives a closing address at The Response, a day of public prayer and fasting at Houston's Reliant Stadium that drew roughly 30,000 people, on Aug. 6. Perry attended the daylong prayer rally despite criticism that the event inappropriately mixes religion and politics. The Texas governor has already made clear, via leaks from aides to the media, that he will effectively announce his intention to run for president Saturday. Rick Perry is appearing before a conservative bloggers’ convention in South Carolina, then he immediately flies to New Hampshire for an event in a GOP activist’s home. The next day he comes to Iowa, completing the trifecta of earliest-nominating states. But there’s more to running for president than throwing your (10-gallon) hat in the ring. Governor Perry has made serious headway on those fronts, and the response has been positive, Republican insiders say.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bill Bratton: "My assignment is to focus on the American experience dealing with gangs" Communities cannot "arrest their way out" of gang crime, the prime minister's new crime adviser, US "supercop" Bill Bratton, has warned. The former New York police chief meets David Cameron next month to discuss violence in English cities and says the issue is for society as a whole. But some police described Mr Bratton's appointment as a "slap in the face". Ian Hanson of the Greater Manchester Police Federation said Britain did not need someone from "5,000 miles away". "There is anger, there is disappointment, a degree of incredulity as well," Mr Hanson told ITV News in excerpts to be aired on Saturday. "The police leadership has also stepped forward in support of their officers and the service and now to be given this slap in the face by the prime minister and told that he wants to bring in Bill Bratton to cure all policing ills." Image caption Bill Bratton (left) is credited for cutting crime after the 1992 LA riots Extra police numbers will be maintained on city streets through the weekend. He welcomed the advice from Mr Bratton, saying that he would help tackle the "deep-seated social problems" behind the riots. Mr Bratton, who is also credited with restoring law and order in Los Angeles after the riots there in 1992, told US broadcaster ABC: "You can't arrest your way out of the problem. "Arrest is certainly appropriate for the most violent, the incorrigible, but so much of it can be addressed in other ways and it's not just a police issue, it is in fact a societal issue."

Scientists use gene therapy, patients' own immune systems to fight leukemia
AP (CBS/AP) A new leukemia treatment has experts buzzing over a possible cure that may one day change cancer treatment forever. According to experts, the treatment is a gene therapy that turns a patient's own blood cells into assassins that tracks down and destroys cancer cells. They've only tested it in three patients so far, but the results were noteworthy. Two patients appear cancer-free a year after treatment, and the third patient still has some cancer but is improved. "It worked great," said study author Dr. Carl June, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, the only hope for a cure is bone marrow or stem cell transplants, which don't always work and can be fatal. Earlier attempts at genetically modifying T-cells, our "bloodstream soldiers," have had limited success -the modified cells didn't reproduce well and quickly vanished. For the study - published in the "New England Journal of Medicine" and "Science Translational Medicine" - scientists took blood from three patients with very advanced cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and genetically altered it in a lab.

Chinese human rights activist faces trial
BEIJING - A Chinese activist known for pushing legal issues and backing a jailed Nobel peace laureate went on trial yesterday on a vaguely worded charge, reinforcing Beijing’s sweeping crackdown on dissent. Wang Lihong, 56, pleaded not guilty to the charge of “creating a disturbance’’ stemming from her participation in a demonstration outside a court in Fuzhou city in southern China in April 2010. The gathering was in support of three bloggers accused of slander after they tried to help an illiterate woman pressure authorities to reinvestigate her daughter’s death. One of Wang’s lawyers, Han Yicun, said the trial lasted 2 1/2 hours and that a verdict was expected later this month. If convicted, she faces up to five years in jail. Han said the trial was not fair because the judge interrupted both him and Wang as they tried to present her defense and because they were assigned a courtroom too small to accommodate observers. Wang Lihong, a 55-year-old woman doctor who is one of a surging number of bloggers using the internet to draw attention to the lack of basic civil rights in China, pleaded not guilty to a catch-all charge of "creating a disturbance" which carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail. Officially Mrs Wang's charges relate to allegations that she participated in a similar, but larger, demonstration outside a court in the southern city of Fuzhou in April 2010 where three fellow bloggers were on trial for 'slandering' Chinese government officials. Unofficially, say activists, Mrs Wang is one of dozens of activists that the Chinese government has moved to silence following the so-called Jasmine revolutions earlier this year, with dozens of lawyers, bloggers, activists and artists, including Ai Weiwei, detained.

U.S. Presidential candidate Michele Bachmann narrowly edges Ron Paul in Ames Straw Poll
The decision is understandable. He spent a fortune (maybe a million dollars). He received 2,293 votes, less than half the votes Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) did. He also got less than half the votes Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) He threw punch after punch at Bachmann, none landed. As an aside, I wonder what all those people are thinking who in 2008 said, “If only John McCain chose Pawlenty as VP!” His record was solid; his persona and retail politicial skills were insufficient. His campaign, as those caught in a death spiral often are, became increasingly dysfunctional. In failing to aggressively and effectively pursue Romney and then Bachmann he demonstrated his own lack of personal authority. His departure leaves Mitt Romney with no real challenger for moderate and centrist Republicans. But as Pawlenty exits, a new figure may be emerging. Rick Santorum only raised $582,348 in the second quarter.

High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville, said in the past eight days alone, the U.N. Human Rights Office has received reports of the killing of one journalist in Baluchistan and the disappearance of another journalist in North Waziristan. He says that various journalist groups cite Pakistan as one of the most dangerous places, if not the most dangerous place, for journalists. "At least 16 were killed in 2010 and according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, nine journalists have been killed in Pakistan so far in 2011. "In Baluchistan alone, there were disturbing reports that 25 people - this is a mix of journalists, writers, students and human rights defenders - have been extra-judicially killed within the first four months of 2011.”  Notorious cases, such as al-Qaida's kidnapping and brutal murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in 2002 are rare.

REUTERS/via Reuters TV AL-MAYA, Libya Muammar Gaddafi urged Libyans to take up arms and crush an uprising in Tripoli as rebel troops closed on the capital for a final onslaught on his stronghold. "I am afraid if we don't act, they will burn Tripoli," he said in an audio address broadcast on state television. "There will be no more water, food, electricity or freedom." Thousands of rebel fighters 25 km (15 miles) west of Tripoli were moving towards the capital on Sunday evening. As they advanced, they took control of a barracks belonging to the Khamis brigade, an elite security unit commanded by one of Gaddafi's sons, Khamis. In a coordinated revolt that rebel cells had been secretly preparing for months, shooting started on Saturday night across Tripoli, moments after Muslim clerics, using the loudspeakers on mosque minarets, called people on to the streets. Gaddafi, in his second audio broadcast in 24 hours, dismissed the rebels as rats. "I am giving the order to open the weapons stockpiles," Gaddafi said. "I call on all Libyans to join this fight.

Trapped journalists in Libya freed
Three dozen correspondents holed up in Rixos hotel in Libya as battles rage for control of Tripoli About three dozen foreign journalists based at the five-star Rixos hotel in Tripoli have been trapped by heavy fighting in the surrounding streets as rebels advance on the capital. "No one has left the hotel today," said Missy Ryan, a correspondent for Reuters. "We all want to go downtown to report on what's happening but it's not safe." Snipers were positioned outside the hotel, she added. The hotel is close to the Gaddafi regime's sprawling Bab al-Aziziya compound, which is likely to see the last stand of loyalist fighters in the coming days and reportedly the scene of heavy fighting. The Associated Press reported that trucks loaded with anti-aircraft machine guns were outside the Rixos and loyalist snipers were posted behind trees in the area. For months, many have feared they could be held by the regime as human shields if rebels reached the capital. The only exit route from Tripoli by land, the road to the Tunisian border, has been cut off by rebel fighters for more than a week. The hotel entrance was still being guarded by Gaddafi forces and volunteers, she said, but the officials based at the Rixos had left over the past 24 hours.

Out of space in outer space: Special report on NASA's 'space junk' plans
Image copyright SPL Image caption Fortunately, there have been very few collisions in orbit so far The US National Research Council's report on space debris is not the first of its kind. A wide range of space agencies and intergovernmental organisations has taken a bite out of this issue down the years. The opinion expressed is always the same: the problem is inescapable and it's getting worse. It's also true the tone of concern is being ratcheted up. There is now a wild jungle of debris overhead - everything from old rocket stages that continue to loop around the Earth decades after they were launched, to the flecks of paint that have lifted off once shiny space vehicles and floated off into the distance. It is the legacy of more than half a century of space activity. Today, it is said there are more than 22,000 pieces of debris actively being tracked. These are just the big, easy-to-see items, however. Moving around unseen are an estimated 500,000 particles ranging in size between 1-10cm across, and perhaps tens of millions of other particles smaller than 1cm. All of this stuff is travelling at several kilometres per second - sufficient velocity for even the smallest fragment to become a damaging projectile if it strikes an operational space mission. Gravity ensures that everything that goes up will eventually come back down, but the bath is currently being filled faster than the plug hole and the overflow pipe can empty it.

Shooting at diner in Carson City, Nevada

Victims lay both inside and outside the restaurant in the wake of the shooting. Mr. Sencion filed for bankruptcy in 2009, when he was living in nearby Stateline, a rough-around-the-edges casino town on the California border. Photo Ralph Swagler, the owner of a nearby barbecue restaurant, told The A.P. that he saw the gunman pull up outside the restaurant, where he first shot a man on a motorcycle and then headed inside.

REUTERS/Keld Navntoft/Scanpix Denmark A voter casts his ballots in Denmark's general elections at a polling station in Fredericia, near Copenhagen September 15, 2011. REUTERS/Scanpix/Claus Fisker COPENHAGEN Denmark's centre-left "Red bloc" took power on Thursday after defeating Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen's government in a tight election driven by voter anger over the state of the economy. Social Democrat Helle Thorning-Schmidt will become Denmark's next prime minister, the first woman to hold the post, after Rasmussen conceded defeat. Her platform includes increased government spending, raising taxes on the wealthy and an unusual plan to make everyone work 12 minutes more per day. The centre-right "Blue bloc" has been in power for 10 years, during which Denmark, like other countries, suffered the worst economic downturn since World War Two. "Tomorrow I will hand in the government's resignation to the Queen," Rasmussen said on TV2 News. "There is no longer a basis for remaining in government." Thorning-Schmidt's Red bloc will have a majority of up to five seats in the 179-seat parliament, its final size depending on the results from far-flung Greenland. Her Social Democratic party actually lost a seat and will only be the second largest in parliament after Rasmussen's Liberals, who gained one.

US hikers freed after two years of custody in Iran
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The hikers' release has been negotiated against a backdrop of tension between Washington and Tehran A pair of Americans convicted as spies and jailed in Iran for two years have been released and emotionally reunited with their loved ones. Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, both 29, were flown to Oman after being freed on bail from Evin prison. They were sentenced in September to eight years in prison on charges of spying. They were arrested in 2009 after crossing into Iran from Iraq, where they said they were hiking. 'Healthy and strong' "We are so happy we are free and so relieved we are free," Mr Fattal said to reporters soon after their arrival on Wednesday in the Omani capital, Muscat. Analysis The release is as carefully choreographed as their colleague Sarah Shourd's a year ago. The question is whether the release of the hikers is designed to defuse tensions between Washington and Tehran. The current distrust is focused on Iran's nuclear programme - peaceful, and not aimed at building an atomic bomb, insists Tehran, amid Western scepticism. Washington's criticism of Iran's repression of protests is another flashpoint. Some Iran analysts say Tehran wants better relations after years of distrust, but others see the hikers' release as a chess move by President Ahmadinejad as he tries to shore up his internal political position. Mr Bauer added: "Two years in prison is too long and we sincerely hope for the freedom of other political prisoners and other unjustly imprisoned people in America and Iran." Ms Shourd became engaged to Mr Bauer while they were in prison, before she was freed last year on humanitarian grounds and returned home.

Unauthorised autobiography of Julian Assange sells less than 700 copies
The autobiography of Julian Assange is published today despite attempts by the WikiLeaks founder to suppress it after a bitter row with its publisher. In the manuscript, excerpts of which appear exclusively in today's Independent, Mr Assange addresses for the first time the events that forced him into a costly extradition battle over allegations that he sexually abused two women during a stay in Stockholm last summer. It appears despite his decision this year to withdraw his co-operation. After protracted efforts to secure either his consent to publication or the return of an advance worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, his publisher, Canongate, has decided to go ahead. The book offers a deeply personal insight into a man who, in less than a year, went from being an obscure former hacker to one of the world's most recognisable faces thanks to his organisation's explosive revelations. A whole chapter is devoted to explaining his side of the Swedish story. "It will be difficult to keep anger out of this account, owing to the sheer level of malice and opportunism that has driven the case against me." According to the book Mr Assange had been warned that the US government wanted to set him up. He admits to sleeping with two women but says their allegations that some of the encounters were not consensual are either part of a conspiracy or motivated by his failure to return their calls. It begins with his peripatetic childhood in Australia with his bohemian parents, and describes how he plunged into the underworld of early hacking and later formed WikiLeaks as a whistle-blowing platform. But it is his account of his time in Sweden that will draw most attention. "The international situation had me in its grip, and although I had spent time with these women, I wasn't paying enough attention to them, or ringing them back," he states.

Afghan employee kills U.S. citizen at Kabul CIA base
KABUL An Afghan security guard employed by the U.S. Embassy opened fire inside a CIA office in Kabul on Sunday evening, killing an American contractor and injuring a second person, U.S. and Afghan officials said, in the second major breach of embassy security in two weeks. The killing adds to a sense of insecurity already heightened by a 20-hour siege of the diplomatic district in mid-September, and the assassination a week later of the top government peace envoy, former President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The CIA compound inside the Ariana hotel is one of the most heavily guarded in Kabul, and has been off-limits to the public -- along with the road that runs beside it -- for almost a decade. The compound lies at the heart of the capital's heavily guarded military, political and diplomatic district, a virtual "green zone" that is almost impossible for ordinary Afghans to enter. In Washington, U.S. officials said that an investigation of the shooting was continuing. "Although all possible motivations for the attack are being investigated, no further details on the motivation are available at this time," a U.S. official told Reuters on Monday. The American killed in the incident has not been named nor has his precise role at the embassy been disclosed. A U.S. official said he was "one of many who provided essential support for the maintenance of the U.S. Embassy complex in Kabul," and that he "will be sorely missed." Sundwall declined comment on whether the annex housed the CIA, but Kabul Police Chief Ayub Salangi said there had been an exchange of fire at the Ariana hotel, which he described as a CIA office. He declined further comment on what happened in an area where access is restricted even for Afghan forces.

Gilad Shalit to be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners
Tens of thousands of Palestinians took to the streets in the northern Gaza Strip late Tuesday, celebrating the news that after years of on-and-off German and Egyptian-mediated negotiations, Israel and Hamas had reached a prisoners' exchange deal. They handed out sweets, waved the green flags of the radical Islamist Hamas movement ruling Gaza, and chanted slogans in support of the al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' armed wing. AP Most of them were in Jabaliya, a refugee camp north of Gaza City, the hometown of many Palestinian militants jailed in Israel. In Jerusalem, the family of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza for the past five years, could be seen waiting nervously and excitedly in the protest tent that has been their home for the past months, outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence. ((Ariel Shalit/Associated Press)) Israel and Hamas have signed a prisoner-exchange deal that will secure the release of an Israeli soldier held in Gaza for more than five years "in the coming days," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday. Netanyahu told reporters late Tuesday he informed Gilad Shalit's parents, Aviva and Noam Shalit, earlier Tuesday of the deal to swap Shalit, 25, who was taken by Hamas-linked Palestinian militants in June 2006 near the border with Gaza. The Israeli government approved the deal early Wednesday after a three-hour debate. "There is built-in tension between the desire to return a kidnapped soldier ... and the need to preserve the security of the citizens of Israel," Netanyahu said, in comments at the opening of the cabinet meeting. One cabinet minister who voted against the deal, Uzi Landau, said it provides "incentive to kill Israelis and to carry out further abductions." The deal, signed Tuesday after talks through Egyptian and German mediators, will likely free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners currently in Israeli custody and still requires approval by the Israeli cabinet, Israeli media reported. "I do not know if the near future would have allowed us to achieve a better deal, or a deal at all, since it is very likely that this window of opportunity created in these circumstances would have finally closed, and we wouldn't have freed Gilad at all," Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted Netanyahu as saying Tuesday.

Herman Cain: SimCity rumor 'a lie'
Rarely does the world of politics cross over into my little video game corner here, much less something as significant as the presidential race, but I woke up today with a note in my inbox that claimed candidate Herman Cain’s 9-9-9 tax plan might have had gaming inspiration. As it turns out, in Maxis’s SimCity 4, the default tax rates actually all start at 9% for commercial taxes, 9% for industrial and 9% for residential. It’s not exactly corporate, income and sales, but it’s close enough to be noticeable. The Huffington Post made the connection, and contacted Maxis for comment. "We encourage politicians to continue to look to innovative games like SimCity for inspiration for social and economic change," said Katsarelis. "While we at Maxis and Electronic Arts do not endorse any political candidates or their platforms, it's interesting to see GOP candidate Herman Cain propose a simplified tax system like one we designed for the video game SimCity 4." Cain cites his own economic advisors for coming up with the plan, not the video game, but one has to wonder, if it’s right for SimCity, is it right for America? But in reality, Cain’s plan would be in effect raising taxes on the poor, many of whom currently pay no income tax, raising taxes on the middle class, due to the loss of tax credits and the increased sales tax, and lowering taxes for the rich. Democrats obviously hate it, but even many Republicans oppose the increases it would trigger, and Cain’s rivals for the nomination have jumped on him by saying that his plan might be simple, but it wouldn’t work in practice. The Cain camp remains resolute however responding to the SimCity comparisons by saying “everyone likes 9-9-9.” While that might be true for some, unfortunately there aren’t any cheat codes to make the math work in real life. WASHINGTON -- On Friday, Herman Cain responded to The Huffington Post's analysis of the similarities between his "999" economic plan and the default tax rate in "SimCity 4," saying he did not get the idea from the video game. "You said you had original ideas, successful people around you thinking ideas up," the reporter said while questioning Cain about the "999" plan.

Kenya troops enter Somalia after kidnappings
Image copyright AFP Image caption Kenyan troops have been converging on the border with Somalia in recent days Kenya's foreign minister has told the BBC his country has sent troops into neighbouring Somalia to target the Islamist militant group al-Shabab. Witnesses described dozens of military vehicles pouring over the border, backed by planes and helicopters. Reports say al-Shabab, which denies carrying out the abductions, has begun preparing militias to fight back. Al-Shabab spokesman Ali Mohamud Rage told the BBC Somali service: "We will defend ourselves. Kidnap victims Judith Tebbutt: British tourist, 56 years old, snatched by gunmen on 11 September British tourist, 56 years old, snatched by gunmen on 11 September Marie Dedieu: 66-year-old French national, taken on 1 October days after she arrived in Kenya 66-year-old French national, taken on 1 October days after she arrived in Kenya Blanca Thiebaut and Montserrat Serra: Spanish aid workers seized from the Dadaab refugee camp on 13 October Abducted from Kenya: Profiles Q&A: Al-Shabab Several Westerners have been seized in Kenya by suspected Somali militants and reportedly taken into Somalia. A British woman and a French woman have been kidnapped from remote beach resorts over the past month, dealing a major blow to Kenya's tourism industry. There have been conflicting reports about possible perpetrators of the kidnappings - with some claiming al-Shabab had carried them out, and others saying pirate gangs could be the attackers. Foreigners repelled Mr Wetangula said the troops went across the border on the request of Somalia's transitional government, which controls very little territory but is backed by the international community.

Crown Prince Sultan of Saudi Arabia dies
Story highlights King Abdullah leaves Riyadh hospital after back surgery President Obama says the United States has lost a 'valued friend' Sultan had been ill for some time and died in a New York hospital Prince Nayef, a reputed conservative, is a likely successor The heir to the Saudi throne, Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, died in a New York hospital early Saturday, officials said, raising succession questions in the key oil-producing country at a time of regional turmoil. Sultan, the half-brother of King Abdullah, was thought to be in his 80s. He had been ill for some time -- various reports indicated that he was battling cancer -- and was receiving treatment in New York. Saudi television broke into normal programming early Saturday to announce the death. Sultan's body will be flown back to Saudi Arabia and a burial is scheduled for Tuesday. "He was a strong supporter of the deep and enduring partnership between our two countries," Obama said. Rather, it's a complex process and decisions are always cloaked in secrecy in the conservative kingdom.

Football: FA charges Chelsea for player misconduct; John Terry investigated over alleged racial abuse
Media playback is not supported on this device Villas-Boas critical of referee Chelsea have been fined £20,000 by the Football Association (FA) after admitting failing to control their players in last week's match at QPR. The FA are yet to rule on manager Andre Villas-Boas after asking him to explain comments made about referee Chris Foy. Villas-Boas said a "very poor" display from Foy influenced the club's 1-0 defeat. Two Chelsea players were sent off and seven yellow carded. He faces a fine or touchline ban if he is charged and found guilty. The FA told BBC Sport on Friday that they are still studying the comments made by the Portuguese manager. Foy awarded the home side a penalty and sent off both Jose Bosingwa and Didier Drogba before the break. "We have had three referees [this season] with a direct influence on the result and I think it's too much.

UNESCO votes in favor of Palestine membership
The Israeli government said Monday's vote by the United Nations cultural agency to accept the Palestinians' bid as a full member would harm efforts to revive Arab-Israeli peace talks. A foreign ministry statement called UNESCO's action in Paris a "unilateral Palestinian maneuver" that further removed the possibility for a peace agreement. "This is very good news for history, for culture, for heritage, for identity, for self-dignity," said Mahdi Abdul Hadi, head of Jerusalem's Palestinian Academic Society. "This is very good news for those who believe in the Palestinian cause, that it is time, overdue, to recognize the Palestinian rights." 107 UNESCO delegates voted in favor of the Palestinian bid. Some analysts said the vote will boost the Palestinian move for U.N. state membership launched at the General Assembly last month. "What the Palestinians really have to look for is the establishment of a Palestinian state and this is not going to be implemented by the decision of an international organization -- of course not UNESCO, but (not) even the General Assembly," he said. They say only direct negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis can do this.

Qantas grounds all flights in labour dispute
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Qantas CEO Alan Joyce announces grounding of the airline The Australian airline Qantas is grounding all international and domestic flights with immediate effect due to an industrial dispute. A statement said all employees involved in industrial action would be locked out from Monday evening and flights grounded from 0600 GMT on Saturday. Aircraft currently in the air will complete their flights, but there will be no further departures. Fair Work Australia, the national industrial tribunal, adjourned a hearing on the Qantas dispute on Saturday night. The tribunal - which has the power to suspend or terminate industrial action - is to reconvene later on Sunday. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has warned that the dispute could have "implications" for the national economy. The airline has been hit by a series of costly strikes. Baggage handlers, engineers and pilots have been involved in the action which the company says is costing A$15m (US$16m) a week. The airline issued a statement on its Facebook page saying customers booked on Qantas flights should not go to the airport until further notice. Analysis At the heart of the dispute are concerns about pay and job security along with cost-cutting and the subcontracting of work overseas as Qantas looks to set up new airlines in Asia and sack hundreds of staff to revive its sagging international fortunes. Qantas' decision to pull its entire international and domestic fleets from the skies comes during one of Australia's busiest travel weekends, with tens thousands of people converging on the hugely popular Melbourne Cup horse race, an event that stops the nation for a few, brief minutes.

California campus pepper spray police suspended
SAN FRANCISCO - Two University of California, Davis police officers involved in pepper-spraying seated protesters are being placed on administrative leave as the chancellor of the school accelerates the investigation into the incident. UC Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi on Sunday said she has been inundated with reaction over the incident, in which an officer dispassionately fires pepper spray on a line of sitting demonstrators. Video of the incident was circulated widely on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter on Saturday, in which protesters flinch and cover their faces but remain passive with their arms interlocked, as onlookers shriek and scream out for the officer to stop. The university's faculty association called on Katehi to resign, saying in a letter there had been a "gross failure of leadership." Katehi said she takes "full responsibility for the incident" but has resisted calls for her resignation, instead pledging to take actions to make sure "that this does not happen again." At a news conference Saturday, Katehi said what the video shows is, "sad and really very inappropriate." "I do not think that I have violated the policies of the institution," she said. Outrage over police pepper-spraying students Video: Police pepper-spray passive students However, a law enforcement official who watched the clip called the use of force "fairly standard police procedure." Katehi remained in a media room for more than two hours after the news conference Saturday, eventually walking to an SUV past a group of students nearly three blocks long who, in a coordinated effort, remained completely silent. Below is video from CBS Station KOVR of Katehi leaving the building The protest was held in support of the overall Occupy Wall Street movement and in solidarity with protesters at the University of California, Berkeley who were jabbed by police with batons on Nov. 9. Charles J. Kelly, a former Baltimore Police Department lieutenant who wrote the department's use of force guidelines, said pepper spray is a "compliance tool" that can be used on subjects who do not resist, and is preferable to simply lifting protesters.

Myanmar dissident Suu Kyi to run for parliament in by-elections
Image caption Aung San Suu Kyi may be an MP by the end of the year Aung San Suu Kyi will try to win a seat in Burma's parliament in forthcoming by-elections, her party has confirmed. Ms Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) have operated outside of the political system for years. They won a landslide election victory in 1990 but the result was never recognised by the ruling generals. However, in recent days the NLD and the international community have given cautious praise to reforms undertaken by the current government. The US announced it would sent Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the country for the first such visit in 50 years. And the regional political bloc Asean confirmed Burma had reformed enough for it to hold the chair of the group in 2014. Signs of change The NLD announced on Friday that it was dropping its boycott of elections and would put up candidates for all 48 seats that have been available in a series of by-elections left vacant by reshuffles. Ms Suu Kyi did not confirm whether she would be a candidate. However, on Monday, NLD official Nyan Win told reporters: "Aung San Suu Kyi intends to stand for the by-election but it's a bit early to say from which constituency she will run." They held a sham election last year that was boycotted by the NLD - the only opposition group strong enough to challenge the army.

NYC Mayor Bloomberg's Obama comments raise speculation of presidential bid
Michael Bloomberg has criticized both Democrats and Republicans for 'political cowardice.' Bloomberg pivots to slamming D.C. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has moved in recent days to reclaim the title of the nation’s top Washington outsider, embarking on a messaging tour to blast Congress and the White House for failing to reach a bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction. In numerous TV and radio appearances, Bloomberg has criticized Democrats and Republicans for their “political cowardice.” He’s endorsed proposals for debt reduction that include ending the Bush tax cuts and implementing the Simpson-Bowles Commission’s austerity plan. Story Continued Below And in a departure from Bloomberg’s general practice of not criticizing the president – and calling on the country to unite behind him – the mayor accused President Barack Obama of failing to “provide leadership in difficult situations.” On one level, Bloomberg’s media blitz is more of the same for a politician who has long sought out influence in national politics, often on a similar set of issues. But to some, Bloomberg’s national messaging tour also looks like an escape from a third term that has not gone as hoped for. From botched snow removal last winter to a ticket-fixing scandal in the New York Police Department, to – most infamously – Bloomberg’s showdown with Occupy Wall Street, there’s a palpable sense that things have soured on the home front. Against that backdrop, the tumult of national politics might look like a relatively welcoming place for Bloomberg to start shaping a post-mayoral role for himself. “My suspicion is he hasn’t quite figured out what his next act is, but the one thing he knows he wants is to stay relevant and continue cultivating his brand as the independent, sane, grown-up voice in American politics,” said Democratic strategist Dan Gerstein, a veteran of Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman’s independent 2006 campaign. “This plays into his sweet spot: It’s the intersection of independence, adult leadership, and finance and economics.” Attacking Washington over the budget showdown, Gerstein said, is a way for Bloomberg to try and put the political quagmire of Occupy Wall Street behind him – and to reclaim a public identity other than that of an investment banker-defending media billionaire. “This episode has – not just in terms of his management of the protests, but in how he talked about the underlying issues – done real damage to his brand,” said the strategist. “Both the perception and substance is that he’s out of sync with the mood of the country in some of his comments about the nature of capitalism today and income inequality.” Bloomberg advisers dismiss the notion that the mayor is diverting attention from the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations, which the NYPD broke up last week. He accused members of Congress of "political cowardice" for helping bring about a "disaster for the country" but the former Democrat and Republican who is now an Independent reserved his strongest words for Mr Obama.

Early returns in Egyptian polls show victory for Islamist parties
Muslim Brotherhood expected to be dominant force after it said its party had taken at least 40 per cent of the vote. Nine of Egypt's 27 governorates went to the polls this week and full results will not be known until January [Reuters] Egypt's election commission has again delayed the release of results of the opening stage of the country's first polls, saying counting was still taking place. The results, which had already been pushed back from Wednesday evening until Thursday, will now be released on Friday, the official MENA news agency quoted chief electoral official Abdel Moez Ibrahim as saying. The delay was necessary "as the counting of votes is still going on in a number of districts because of the large number of voters who took part in these elections," said Ibrahim. The vote on Monday and Tuesday in Cairo and Alexandria and other areas was the first of three stages when voters from nine of the country's 27 governorates went to the polls to elect a new lower house of parliament. The rest of the country follows next month and in January. Live Box 20111120475439857 Results for the party list seats, which make up two-thirds of the People's Assembly, will not be available until January. Unofficial numbers have begun to leak out, though, mostly from sources within the parties. A source in the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), the Muslim Brotherhood's political party, said on Wednesday that it had won roughly 40 per cent of the vote, according to its own exit polls. The FJP is nominally a part of the Democratic Alliance, but the bloc's other members are mostly small and unknown; FJP candidates comprise 70 per cent of the alliance's candidates in party list districts, and 90 per cent in individual districts. Strong showing predicted Basil Adel, a member of the Egyptian Bloc, also predicted a strong showing for Islamists: He told Reuters that the Democratic Alliance had won between 40 and 50 per cent of the vote, and predicted a 5-to-7-per cent showing for the Nour party. Adel said his own bloc, the main liberal alliance in Egypt, secured between 20 and 30 per cent of votes counted so far in Cairo. Live Box 2011111713397233347 Diaa Rashwan, the head of the Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, told Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram newspaper that Islamist parties - including the FJP, Nour, and several other smaller parties - could collectively win 65 per cent of seats in the first round of voting.

Alleged racist tram ranter remanded after court hearing
A woman accused of a racist rant on a tram broke down in tears as a video of the incident was played in court. The 34-year old, who originally pleaded not guilty, chose to be tried by a judge and jury and will re-enter a plea at Crown Court. Wearing a black cardigan and a blue top, she cried out of the sight of the packed public gallery, as the two-and-a-half minute video was played. Miss West will spend Christmas in prison after magistrates refused her bail application. She again broke down in tears, and shouted "no, please," as she was remanded in custody until her next hearing. Family members also broke down and supporters in the public gallery shouted "what a disgrace" and "we love you Emma" as the decision was announced. Chairman of the bench, Mr McNeil, told her she was being remanded in custody for her own safety after death threats were posted on YouTube and Facebook. Emma West, 34, broke down as video of the alleged incident was played to Croydon magistrates court A woman broke down in the dock as a video allegedly showing her racially abusing fellow passengers on a busy tram was played out to a courtroom.

Authorities blockade Chinese town rebelling over land dispute
Image caption Images supplied by villagers show large rallies in Wukan China's internet censors have blocked searches relating to an ongoing protest in the village of Wukan, web users say. Users of Sina Weibo, the country's Twitter-like micro-blogging site, say searches for Wukan return no results. Instead, a message appears saying: "According to relevant law, regulations and policies, search results for Wukan cannot be displayed." A land dispute in the Guangdong village intensified this week when a villager died in police custody. Roads into the village have been closed and are being guarded by heavily armed security personnel on one side, and villagers on the other. At the scene On Thursday morning there was a fresh rally by villagers chanting slogans like "Down with corrupt officials" but also "Long live the Communist Party", showing that the protesters are placing the blame for the dispute on local officials. Entering Wukan is difficult - the police have erected a cordon around the village, as have the villagers themselves. They say five men have been snatched from the village by the police in recent days, with no reason given for their detention. Many in the village say the only way to protect themselves is uniting and speaking out.

Remaining US troops exit Iraq
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The exit of US troops leaves behind a fragile democracy in Iraq The last convoy of US troops to leave Iraq has entered Kuwait, nearly nine years after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. The final column of about 100 armoured vehicles carrying 500 soldiers crossed the southern Iraqi desert overnight. At the peak of the operation there were 170,000 US troops and more than 500 bases in Iraq. Nearly 4,500 US soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis have died since the US-led campaign began in 2003. The operation has cost Washington nearly $1 trillion (£643bn). Analysis US troops have trained up Iraqi security forces which, if they stick together, can arguably contain the internal security situation, still stubbornly jammed at a level of violence which kills on average around 350 people every month. But security has to be rooted in political stability, and that's only one of many challenges immediately facing Iraq. Even as the final US troops were heading for the border, a political crisis was erupting in Baghdad, with deputies from Ayyad Allawi's Iraqiyya block pulling out of parliament. There is turmoil in two mainly Sunni provinces, which want to declare themselves autonomous regions like the Kurds in the north. While most Iraqis believe it was high time for the Americans to go, many are deeply worried about the challenges that lie ahead. US forces ended combat missions in Iraq in 2010 and had already handed over much of their security role. "(It's) a good feeling... knowing this is going to be the last mission out of here," said Private First Class Martin Lamb, part of the final "tactical road march" out of Iraq.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-il dead
SEOUL, South Korea — Kim Jong-il , the North Korean leader who realized his family’s dream of turning his starving, isolated country into a nuclear-weapons power even as it sank further into despotism, died on Saturday of a heart attack while traveling on his train, according to an announcement Monday by the country’s state-run media. Word of Kim’s death sent shock waves through North Korea’s Asia neighbors and reverberated around the world, reflecting the unpredictable outcome of an abrupt leadership change in one of the most opaque and repressive countries. North Korea is technically still at war with South Korea and the United States after nearly 60 years and has few friends besides China. South Korea immediately put its armed forces on a high state of alert, and the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that North Korea tested an unspecified number of short-range missiles on Monday morning. The news agency said the tests were conducted before the announcement of Mr. Kim’s death. The Defense Ministry in Seoul said it could not comment on the report. The North had kept news of the death of its leader secret for roughly two days, perhaps a sign that the leadership was struggling to position itself for what many believe could be a particularly perilous transition. A few hours after the announcement, the ruling Workers’ Party and other state institutions released a joint statement suggesting Mr. Kim’s chosen successor, his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, was in charge. The Workers’ Party said that “Under the leadership of our comrade Kim Jong-un, we have to turn sadness into strength and courage, and overcome today’s difficulties.” K.C.N.A., the official news agency, said North Korean soldiers and citizens were swearing allegiance to Kim Jong-un. The North has indicated he was 69 years old, but scholars have said he could have been a year older.

Indian Parliament irate as Russia poised to ban Bhagavad Gita
Image caption Hare Krishna adherents protest in Calcutta Indian Foreign Minister SM Krishna has described as "absurd" a complaint in Russia that the Hindu holy book Bhagvad Gita is an extremist religious text. Indian MPs have expressed outrage at a court case in Russia that could see the Hindu holy book banned there. State prosecutors in Tomsk, in Siberia, recently put Bhagvad Gita say the text sows social discord and want its distribution banned. Russian embassy officials in Delhi said they had great regard for the text. But SM Krishna told parliament that the complaint was filed by "ignorant people" - the holy book had also been put on a list that includes Hitler's Mein Kampf. Russia recognises freedom of religion among its four main faiths, Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Judaism. 'Protect Hindu rights' "The government has taken up the issue with the Russian government and Indian embassy officials are in touch with the officials of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)," Mr Krishna said. Earlier on Tuesday, members from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party expressed outrage over the move in Siberia to ban the holy book. Bhartruhari Mahtab, leader of the Biju Janata Dal, said: "I want to know from the government what it is doing. "It is strange that such events are unfolding in the beautiful university city in Siberia, as Tomsk is famous for its secularism and religious tolerance," Alexander M Kadakin, Russian Ambassador in India, said in a statement on Monday night.

Suspect arrested in Los Angeles arson rampage case
A 24-year-old German national has been arrested in connection with 52 arsons in Los Angeles over the weekend, a case that may have a link to Canada. Police picked up Harry Burkhart, a Hollywood resident, around 2:50 a.m. Monday after a sharp-eyed officer recognized the vehicle he was driving as one wanted in the case. Television news footage of the arrest showed a minivan, purportedly the vehicle in question, with British Columbia licence plates. It also showed a heavyset man with a ponytail, who resembled security-camera footage of a person walking near the car park of the Hollywood and Highland shopping centre around the time it was hit by an arsonist Saturday night. Officers would not say what connection, if any, their suspect has to Canada. They indicated he is from Frankfurt, Germany but do not know when he arrived in the United States. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department records listed Mr. Burkhart's date of birth as July 12, 1987 and described him as having brown hair and eyes, standing 5-feet-10-inches tall and weighing 180 pounds. An appearance at Van Nuys court house is set for Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. Vancouver court documents showed a man with the same name and year of birth was charged with a traffic offence two years ago, but it was not clear if he was the same individual arrested in California. The fires began early Friday morning, and primarily targeted vehicles in parking garages, leaving cars as burnt-out wrecks and blackening apartment buildings across Hollywood, West Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley.

Mitt Romney wins Iowa Caucus by eight votes over surging Rick Santorum
AP Photo/Chris Carlson In Iowa, as evangelicals go, so goes the Republican presidential caucus. Regularly comprising more than half of caucus goers, they have the capability of ensuring a victory for any of the competing candidates. In 2008, they strongly supported Mike Huckabee over Mitt Romney 46 to 19 percent, propelling him to an unexpected victory. Tuesday night, a smaller but still sizable proportion of evangelicals - 32 percent - united behind Rick Santorum, pushing him to the forefront of the contest. Mitt Romney beats Rick Santorum by 8 votes The journey, though, was far different for Santorum than Huckabee. Whereas Huckabee -- an ordained Southern Baptist minister -- stood out among a field of fiscal conservatives, Santorum found himself competing against several other candidates with strong social conservative credentials: Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, and Michelle Bachman. Evangelicals wavered throughout the campaign, pushing each of them to the top of the pre-election points at one point or another. Three factors, though, eventually enabled Santorum to emerge from the pack and unite a substantial number of evangelical voters behind him: Full Iowa results Full Iowa entrance poll results Social Conservative Credentials Many commentators did not see distinctions between the candidates, but evangelical caucus goers sure did. Of the 30 percent of evangelicals who cited being a true conservative as the most important candidate quality in their vote, 44 percent supported Santorum. Perry, Gingrich, and Bachman only received 26 percent support from evangelicals combined. On the important question of abortion, 19 percent of evangelicals cited it as the most important issue in their vote. Of those that did, a whopping 60 percent backed Santorum, compared to only 12 percent for Perry, 9 percent for Gingrich, and 8 percent for Bachmann. According to the Des Moines Register, Santorum spent 104 total days in Iowa, making more than 300 campaign stops in all 99 counties in the state.

31 die in Mexico jail violence
Image caption Soldiers stepped up security around the prison in Altamira Thirty-one inmates have died in a fight between gang members in a prison in northern Mexico, officials say. Altamira is in Tamaulipas state, where the Zetas and Gulf cartels have been fighting a bloody war for control of smuggling routes into the US. Inmates used homemade weapons and knives in what the authorities described as a mass brawl inside the prison. Order was only restored once troops entered the jail to help prison officers. Many of Mexico's prisons are overcrowded and plagued by violence linked to drugs cartels. More than 40,000 Mexicans have died in drug-related violence since December 2006, when President Felipe Calderon began deploying troops to combat the cartels. Gulf and Zetas drug gang members clashed when one group stormed into other's section of jail, according to accounts A fight among inmates armed with makeshift knives, clubs and stones left 31 of them dead in a Mexican prison that holds many members of drug cartels, authorities said. The fight started when a group of inmates burst into a section of the prison from which they were banned and attacked the prisoners housed there. Local media said the fight was between members of the rival Gulf and Zetas drug cartels but authorities would not confirm the reports.

Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world
Image caption Police have previously carried out raids on suspected brothels in Belfast The PSNI will be visiting a number of men who they suspect have paid for sex with trafficked women, a senior officer has confirmed. Detective Superintendent Philip Marshall said there were currently five investigations into organised crime gangs forcing women into prostitution. He said fifteen men would be targeted in an attempt to deter them from using such services. "The police service is driven by trying to rescue victims," he said. Det Spt Marshall said the issue of human trafficking within Northern Ireland was one that needed much more public debate and discussion. He said the words "clients" or "punters" should in fact be replaced with "exploiters, or dare I say it, rapists". 'Literally enslaved' Det Spt Marshall said people from all social classes, backgrounds and ages were paying for sex, many of whom have families who would not know or even suspect they were using such services. "The reality is where you will have people literally enslaved and forced to sell their body several times a day," he said. "This is modern day slavery with people treated as a commodity which is bought and sold." Det Spt Marshall said many trafficking victims were moved around Ireland and the UK and in some cases they did not know geographically where they were. He said it was a "very humbling experience talking to victims" who had been rescued. "It saddens me that we are in some way accepting of this as we are afraid to talk and recognise it." He appealed for landlords or anyone in the hotel sector to contact police with any concerns of trafficking being carried out.

Wikipedia, Reddit in 'blackout' against SOPA, PROTECT IP laws
Millions of students, fact hunters and general knowledge buffs are set to receive a shock on Wednesday when the digital encyclopaedia Wikipedia shuts down for 24 hours in protest at internet piracy laws being considered by US legislators. Jimmy Wales, the founder of the world's fifth most popular website, is instituting a global "day of darkness" for the English-language version of Wikipedia, which will see its 25 million daily users blocked until 5am on Thursday. Wales is calling for a "public uprising" against the stop online piracy act (Sopa) and protect IP act, two US bills which he has called "destructive legislation" that, if passed, would "endanger free speech and set a frightening precedent of internet censorship for the world". Others joining what has been dubbed "black Wednesday" include the user-generated content recommendation website Reddit, technology news site Boing Boing, and the Cheezburger network of humorous sites. When web users visit Wikipedia on Wednesday morning they will not be able to access the 3.8m English articles it holds. Wales issued a tongue-in-cheek warning to students to make sure to "do your homework early". The proposed legislation is the product of years of lobbying by the piracy-hit media, film and music industries and would make it easier for copyright holders and the US government to cut off access to websites accused of containing illegal films, music and TV programming. Opposing them are some of the most high profile of the new wave of digital companies that have grown rapidly over the past decade to challenge the traditional media, film and music industries, including Wikipedia and Google.

Rick Perry withdraws from U.S. presidential race, endorses Gingrich
ET Rick Perry on Thursday dropped his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, throwing his support behind former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. "I have come to the conclusion that there is no viable path forward for me in the 2012 campaign," Perry said at a press conference in North Charleston, South Carolina. "I know when it's time to make a strategic retreat." Perry said the 2012 campaign has "never been about the candidates" but about defeating President Obama and replacing him "with a conservative leader who will bring about real change." He called Gingrich "a conservative visionary who can transform our country." Gingrich appears to be gaining momentum in South Carolina, and Perry's endorsement could give the former speaker a critical boost just two days ahead of the Palmetto state primary. A senior campaign aide said Gingrich's staff had begun reaching out to Perry's campaign "aggressively" in recent days. Gingrich himself had suggested on the campaign trail that it would be helpful for him if Perry were to drop out. The candidate has come under scrutiny for his multiple marriages and past infidelity, and now his second wife, Marianne Gingrich, is saying the GOP presidential candidate wanted an "open marriage." In a December debate, Perry said that marital fidelity is "important"to the presidential race, adding that "he's always kind of been of the opinion that if you cheat on your wife, you'll cheat on your business partner." Today, Perry noted that he and Gingrich have "had our differences... and Newt is not perfect, but who among us is?"

Penn State student blog inaccurately reports death of Joe Paterno
Story highlights Paterno's family says he "fought hard until the end" Paterno had been diagnosed with lung cancer He was known as "JoePa" by players and football fans Paterno was fired in November over allegations he failed to respond to sex abuse allegations Joe Paterno, whose tenure as the most successful coach in major college football history ended abruptly in November amid allegations that he failed to respond forcefully enough to a sex abuse scandal involving a former assistant, died Sunday, his family said. The longtime Penn State head coach was diagnosed with what his family had called a treatable form of lung cancer shortly after the university's Board of Trustees voted to fire him. He had been hospitalized in December after breaking his pelvis in a fall at his home and again in January for what his son called minor complications from his cancer treatments. "It is with great sadness that we announce that Joe Paterno passed away earlier today," the family statement said. "His loss leaves a void in our lives that will never be filled." Paterno died at 9:25 a.m. Sunday, surrounded by his family, State College's Mount Nittany Medical Center said in a statement. Paterno, who was affectionately known as "JoePa" by generations of his players and football fans alike, was widely admired in football circles for what he called his "Grand Experiment" -- his expectation that big-time college football players could succeed on the field while upholding high academic and moral standards away from the gridiron.

"The acclaim for Joe Paterno has stemmed largely from the contrast between the high academic and moral standards he has tried to exemplify and the shameless conduct that often embarrasses and dishonors the college sport he cherishes," author Michael O'Brien wrote in a 1999 biography of Paterno, "No Ordinary Joe."

'Davos man' versus 'Camp Igloo'; 42nd World Economic Forum convenes in Swiss alps
Shares in London and other European stock markets fell after eurozone finance ministers rejected a debt restructuring deal for Greece. Ministers insisted that banks must accept a lower interest rate on the new Greek bonds than the 4% average rate demanded by bondholders. However, Institute of International Finance boss Charles Dallara, who represents private creditors, insisted that the deal on offer was in line with the Greek rescue plan hammered out last October. Thankyou for all your great comments - our live blog coverage will resume tomorrow morning. Leaving aside what is said for show, behind closed doors expect discussions at Davos to focus on three key aspects of the eurozone crisis. First, expect banks to collectively warn Germany and France against inflicting too many losses on holders of Greek government debt. Second, expect the same banks to lobby any government that will listen to go slow on raising capital requirements and other regulations that jeopardise a return to the go-go years. Quick markets update -- the FTSE 100 closed at 5751, down 30 points or 0.5%.

REUTERS/Suhaib Salem Men count Egyptian bank notes at a foreign exchange office in the centre of Cairo in this March 1, 2011 file photo. REUTERS/Peter Andrews/Files Analysis - Egypt faces hurdles in securing IMF aid By Patrick Werr CAIRO Egypt faces a struggle to secure a $3.2 billion (2.0 billion pounds) IMF aid package that economists say is crucial to averting a balance of payments crisis and which, even if it is obtained, could prove to be too little, too late. A year of political and economic turmoil has pushed up unemployment in Egypt, widened its budget and balance of payments deficits, and drained its foreign reserves. Egypt announced last week that it had formally asked the International Monetary Fund for a $3.2 billion loan, saying it wanted the money as soon as possible and hoped an agreement would be signed within weeks. The IMF, however, says any agreement will first have to attract broad political support within the country and be accompanied by financial commitments from other international donors. Thrashing out the technical details of a loan will take two to three months, it said. They can make it, they have sufficient reserves, but two to three months is pushing it," said Raza Agha, an economist with British bank RBS. It may not be easy to convince foreign donors to lend money to Egypt until they see how the government looks after a presidential election expected in June. Nor will it be easy to get broad political support for an agreement that may involve Egypt making economic policy pledges to the IMF -- especially since political parties will be jockeying for position in the country's first freely elected parliament in 60 years, which held its first session on Monday.

British courts give green light for assisted dying case
Lawyers for a stroke victim who wants help to end his "intolerable" life can continue to act on his behalf without fear of prosecution or disciplinary action after a High Court ruling today. They successfully urged two judges in London to grant them a declaration which will protect them and third parties, including doctors, during preparations for a "landmark" judicial review action brought by the unnamed stroke victim. Image caption Martin wants assurances that his doctors and lawyers won't be prosecuted for helping him A man who was virtually paralysed by a stroke has won the first step in his legal bid to pursue his right-to-die. Known only as Martin, he would require professionals to help as his wife has said she will not assist him. But current guidance suggests they may be prosecuted, where loved ones would not, and Martin's case is this discriminates against him. This High Court judgement means lawyers and doctors can discuss assisted dying with him, but only to prepare his case. Third parties In the High Court, two senior judges - Lord Justice Toulson and Mr Justice Charles - said it was a "tragic case" which raised legal and ethical issues. They permit those discussions for the "broad purpose" of "stating that the solicitors may obtain information from third parties and from appropriate experts for the purpose of placing material before the court and that third parties may co-operate in so doing with out the people involved acting in any way unlawfully". Rosa Curling, from solicitors Leigh Day & Co who are representing Martin, said: "We are grateful for the court's judgment handed down today, which confirms that we can press ahead with the preparation of our client's case without fear of criminal and/or disciplinary action being taken against us.

On the campaign trail, February 2012
Rick Santorum’s presidential campaign is actively seeking the support of Democrats in Tuesday’s Michigan primary, running a robocall that sounds oddly like one that would be run by an organized labor group. “Michigan Democrats can vote in the Republican primary on Tuesday,” the narrator says in a copy of the automated call to Democratic voters that was initially obtained by Talking Points Memo. (Mitt) Romney supported the bailout for his Wall Street billionaire buddies, but opposed the auto bailout. That was a slap in the face to every Michigan worker. And we’re not going to let Romney get away with it.” Then the ad closes with: “This call is supported by hard-working Democratic men and women and paid for by Rick Santorum for President.” Despite the disclaimer, the source of the ad was initially unclear when TPM first posted it, and some even thought it was a dirty trick played by Democrats seeking to get supporters to vote for Santorum over Romney. Democrats have toed the line of actively encouraging Democrats to vote against Romney. Santorum has tried to differentiate himself on the issue by noting that he has a blanket no-bailout policy, while Romney supported the Wall Street bailout but not the auto bailout. But Santorum spokesman Hogan Gidley told The Fix that the ad did indeed come from the campaign. “We know that Rick’s message of balanced budget and getting people back to work resonates with Reagan Democrats,” Gidley said, arguing that Santorum’s message has long had appeal to such voters. Romney’s campaign called the calls “outrageous.” “Rick Santorum has moved beyond just ‘taking one for the team;’ he is now willing to wear the other team’s jersey if he thinks it will get him more votes,” said Romney spokesman Ryan Williams. Reporting from Novi, Mich. — Two new polls in the showdown state of Michigan suggest that Rick Santorum failed to gain a badly needed shot of momentum in Wednesday night's Republican presidential debate.

Egypt struggles to recover tourism, investment
CAIRO -- The architect of Egypt's crackdown on U.S.-funded pro-democracy organizations is a holdover from the cabinet of former president Hosni Mubarak who has tried for years to stymie the groups' activities. Faiza Abou el-Naga, the minister who coordinates international aid and long the most powerful woman in the Egyptian government, has survived a series of cabinet purges and weathered the groundswell of anger toward remnants of Mubarak's regime. But her intensifying campaign against the civil society groups offers clear proof, her critics say, that some elements of the old guard remain entrenched and are trying to block the rise of new political leadership in the country. "Mubarak is still ruling in some ways and is still blocking the emergence of a new regime in Egypt," said Abdullah al-Ashaal, a former deputy foreign minister. This week, 43 employees of nongovernmental organizations, including 19 Americans, were charged as part of an investigation of civil society groups. They included the country directors of the Washington-based National Democratic Institute (NDI) and International Republican Institute (IRI), the latter of which is led in Cairo by the son of the U.S. transportation secretary. Abou el-Naga, the public face of the inquiry since it was launched by her ministry last year, has defended the probe, which has jeopardized up to $1.5 billion in U.S. aid. She insists that the Egyptian government has a right to expel unlicensed foreign organizations that she says could further destabilize a country reeling from the aftershocks of a revolution. Speaking to a parliamentary committee on Tuesday, she said the government was not trying to stifle civil society, but rather to enforce policies that protect Egypt's sovereignty. ), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Tuesday called the probe a "dangerous game that risks damaging both Egypt's democratic prospects and the U.S.-Egyptian bilateral relationship."

Opposition calls for mass protests in Bahrain
MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) – Bahraini security forces fanned out across the island nation in unprecedented numbers on Tuesday as Shiites marked the one-year anniversary of their uprising against the country's Sunni rulers. Authorities sent troop reinforcements and armored vehicles to the predominantly Shiite villages around the capital Manama to prevent people from gathering and answering the call of the main opposition movement, Al Wefaq. Six American members of an activist group were detained during the protests, activists and the government said. Authorities said they had violated the terms of their visa, and that they agreed to leave the country without further legal measures taken against them. The government meanwhile threatened to take legal action against the organizers of protests on Monday that turned violent. This could herald a new crackdown on Al Wefaq, which until last year was tolerated but which has suffered sporadic prosecutions and detentions after it took the lead in last year's protests. At least 40 people have been killed during a year of unprecedented political unrest in Bahrain. The island kingdom, the home of the U.S. 5th Fleet, is the Gulf Arab nation hardest hit by upheaval during 2011's Arab Spring protests. The kingdom's ruling dynasty has promised reforms to end the upheaval, although it refuses to make the far-reaching changes the protesters and Al Wefaq, have demanded. These include ending the monarchy's ability to select the government, set key state policies and appoint most of the parliament members. Pearl Square had served as the epicenter of weeks of anti-government protests last year, and its reoccupation would be a major boost for the movement. The government statement said many protesters on Monday departed from a pre-authorized route in Manama, turning the march into a riot after police arrived.

Syrian citizen journalists risk death, targeted; city of Homs facing starvation
Syrian Official: Army Is Protecting Syrian People From Armed Groups Enlarge this image toggle caption Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images The charge d'affaires of the Syrian Embassy in Washington says all the reports coming out of Syria are "absolutely wrong." Zouheir Jabbour told All Things Considered's Melissa Block that even the reports issued by the United Nations and the Arab League are wrong. "In the time of computers, you can fabricate whatever you like and go to Al Jazeera and go to Al Arabiya and you can see all that fabrication," Jabbour said. By all accounts, the Syrian army has embarked on a deadly attack on its own people. And in a report by the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, a panel said it had evidence that that top Syrian officials "bear responsibility for crimes against humanity and other gross human rights violations." In another report this month, Human Rights Watch found that security forces controlled by President Bashar Assad arrested, tortured and killed children as part of the crackdown. "It's an army for all the Syrians and you know what the Syrian army is doing is just protecting the Syrian people from the brutality and from the criminality of the armed groups supported by regional Arab or non-Arab foreign states and nations." Jabbour said the picture we are getting from Syria is wrong and that Assad would step down "when the Syrian people tell Assad step aside."

Iraq police academy suicide bomb attack kills eighteen
It was the deadliest attack in Iraq since January 27, when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-packed car outside a hospital in the Iraqi capital, killing 31 people. Violence in Iraq is down from its peak in 2006 and 2007, but attacks remain common, killing 151 people in January. Police said the suicide bomber was waiting on the street outside the fortified academy near the Interior Ministry headquarters in the east of the Iraqi capital. As the crowd of recruits exited the compound's security barriers in the early afternoon and walked into the road, police said the bomber drove toward them and blew up his car. All of the dead were either police officers or recruits. Another 27 recruits and policemen were wounded. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to release the information. An academy employee said recruits had just finished a two-week training course. Generally, the recruits are escorted out of the compound, but are on their own once they get to the street. Police recruits have been attacked time and time again in spectacular attacks where suicide bombers have infiltrated protection barriers and other checkpoints. In October, 25 people across Baghdad were killed in a string of attacks that included two bombers slamming explosives-packed cars into police stations. Sunday's attack also shows anew extremists' ability to pull off attacks despite government crackdowns and fewer resources.

Maine Senator Olympia Snowe announces she won't seek reelection
Olympia Snowe, one of the Senate's few remaining moderate Republicans, announced Tuesday that she will not seek a fourth term in 2012. The 65-year-old, who had also served in the House for eight terms, said she came to the decision in part after reflecting on the increasingly rancorous climate in Washington. "I am a fighter at heart, and I am well prepared for the electoral battle," she said in a statement. So at this stage of my tenure in public service, I have concluded that I am not prepared to commit myself to an additional six years in the Senate." Snowe becomes the 10th senator to announce plans to retire at the end of the current term, and only the third Republican. Snowe's surprising decision potentially gives the majority party a much needed opportunity to pick up a Republican seat. "Maine has a proud history of electing independent leaders, including a Republican governor in 2010, and while this will be a key battleground in the fall, I am confident it will remain in Republican hands," National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Cornyn said in a statement. In a separate statement, Collins said she was "devastated" by the news. She served our nation with distinction and she continues to bring honor to our state," she said.

On the campaign trail, March 2012
Damon Winter/The New York Times Newt Gingrich used a campaign rally on Thursday afternoon to respond to President Obama’s charge earlier in the day that Republicans were pandering to voters by promising lower gas prices. Mr. Obama compared the presidential candidates to members of the Flat Earth Society for dismissing alternative energy sources like solar and biofuels and emphasizing only versions of “drill, baby, drill.” The president did not name anyone, but Mr. Gingrich had no doubt that it was him in the cross hairs, since he has repeatedly mocked Mr. Obama as “President Algae” for extolling biofuels. “The president maligned me, suggesting I don’t like biofuels,” Mr. Gingrich said at a rally in Illinois, which holds its primary on Tuesday and where, he noted, he drove past a station selling gas for $4.59 a gallon. I am in favor of science and technology.” But he argued that “no serious study” showed that algae could replace a significant amount of oil in the short run. He announced that his campaign would make coffee mugs and mouse pads comparing his promise of $2.50-a-gallon gas with a $10-a-gallon projected price under the president’s policies. It will be a winning issue for Republicans, Mr. Gingrich said, if he becomes the nominee. Mr. Gingrich has made the promise of cheaper gas through aggressive drilling nearly the sole focus of his campaign lately, though he is not alone. And last month, the speaker of the House, John A. Boehner, told Republican colleagues that the soaring price of gas was a political issue they should exploit. The White House is clearly concerned about the potential for higher gas prices to undermine the economic recovery and Mr. Obama’s re-election chances, and the president has given a series of energy speeches in recent weeks to show his concern. Energy Secretary Steven Chu backed down this week from a controversial comment he made in 2008, when he said the best way to encourage conservation would be an increase in gas prices in the United States to the levels seen in Europe.

(LAUGHTER) I hope the analysts in Washington and New York, who spent June and July explaining our campaign was dead... (LAUGHTER) ... will watch this tonight and learn a little bit from this crowd and from this place. (APPLAUSE) We survived the national elite’s effort to kill us in the summer because of you, because people who said, we are not going to allow the elite to decide who we are allowed to nominate. And so, with your help, thousands and thousands of people came to newt.org. And with your help, we survived the two most difficult months of a career which goes back to August of 1958. And June and July were really hard, and it was precisely because the national elite -- especially in the Republican Party -- had decided that a Gingrich presidency was so frightening that they had to kill it early. (APPLAUSE) So with your help and the power of large solutions and big ideas and clear communications in the debates, by December, according to Gallup, I was the frontrunner by 15 points, and according to Rasmussen, I was the frontrunner by 21 points, because you believed in the power of ideas, you believed that people can make a difference, that, in fact, Wall Street money can be beaten by Main Street work. (APPLAUSE) And, of course, at that point, Wall Street money decided that only a relentlessly negative $5 million campaign in Iowa would work, and they did reduce my support from 36 percent to 14 percent in three weeks of unrelenting negativity. GINGRICH: And, once again, the media said, oh, I guess this is over, finally. GINGRICH: And at the very depths of the establishment rejecting it, thousands of more people came to newt.org and signed up.

 Turkish women shout slogans during a protest on the International Women's Day in Ankara on, March 8, 2012. In countries where the day is a public holiday, workers get the day off to celebrate. Armenia, Burkina Faso, Mongolia and Kazakhstan are a few of the countries that are taking the day off. In some countries, such as China, only women get the day off. Flowers are a symbol of International Women’s Day, and many countries celebrate by decorating with flowers, or giving them to women as presents. In Italy, yellow mimosas are popular. In Hanoi, Vietnam, it’s not just boyfriends and husbands giving flowers to the women in their lives, but also bosses and colleagues.

Three UK towns to be made cities following nationwide competition
Three towns from three corners of the UK were celebrating today after being awarded city status to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Chelmsford in Essex, Perth in central Scotland and St Asaph in North Wales were given the honour while Armagh in Northern Ireland was granted a Lord Mayoralty. The awards have been made by the Queen on the advice of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, following a competition to bid for civic honours launched in December 2010. They beat 23 other towns including Reading, Middlesbrough and Blackpool, which had also entered the Civic Honours Competition, and 11 other existing cities which had applied for the additional award of a Lord Mayoralty. Mr Clegg said the decision to award a new city in England, Scotland and Wales, and a Lord Mayoralty in Northern Ireland, reflected the significance of every part of the UK in the marking of the 60th year of the Queen's reign. "Across the United Kingdom, I have been moved by the pride and passion which people have shown in putting their nominations forward," he said. "The standard of application was very high, and those who missed out should not be downhearted. "I hope the competition has given the residents of all of the places which applied a sense of civic pride, of collective ownership and of community spirit." It said in a statement: "This is very welcome news for Chelmsford and everybody who lives and works within the city. "Obviously the other towns in the competition will be disappointed; two were in Essex and I'm sure they will try again, but on behalf of everyone in Chelmsford we would like to thank Her Majesty for this great honour in her Diamond Jubilee year." Perth & Kinross Council said the decision to restore Perth's city status and make it Scotland's seventh city, reflected the fact that it is "at the forefront of Scottish life". Dr John Hulbert, Provost of the local authority, said: "I am delighted that official city status has been restored to Perth.

Funeral for Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria held in Cairo
Tearful and wearing black, tens of thousands of Egyptian Coptic Christians joined a funeral mass for their patriarch, Pope Shenouda III, led by senior clerics at the main cathedral in Cairo. St Mark's Cathedral was packed with local clerics, visiting clergymen and dignitaries as deacons chanted sombre hymns and bearded, black-clad priests and monks recited prayers and dispensed incense smoke from censers. Shenouda's body lay in a white casket in the elaborate regalia he traditionally wore to oversee services, complete with an ornate golden crown. Many in the congregation broke down in tears, while others frantically waved goodbye as the mass came to a close. Clerics, deacons and laypeople gathered around the casket, kissing it, standing in silence or bowing in respect. Tens of thousands more who could not get in followed the mass outside the cathedral, carrying crosses and portraits of Shenouda. Scores of military police were deployed to maintain security outside the cathedral, on one of central Cairo's main arteries, with traffic backed up for hours because of the crowds. We miss you," said a grief-stricken Marianne Saad as she stood in the crowd outside the cathedral. "After God, he was our only protector," lamented another young woman in the crowd. "We will miss him, but he will always be in our hearts," said a young Christian man, Hani Suleiman. After the mass, Shenouda's body was ferried to a military airport east of Cairo, from where it was to be flown later on Tuesday to the desert St Bishoy monastery north-west of the capital, where he will buried.

Sandra Fluke named candidate for Time's 100 most influential people
Time magazine released the ballot for its annual Time 100 issue on Thursday, asking readers to vote for "the leaders, artists, innovators, icons and heroes that they think are the most influential people in the world." That doesn't necessarily mean nice. Among the more than 200 people included on the 2012 ballot: Rush Limbaugh, the outspoken radio talk-show host who sparked a backlash over his controversial comments about Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke. All of the current 2012 presidential candidates—Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul and President Obama—are on the ballot. KONY 2012—the movement against the warlord—is on the list, though its founder, Jason Russell, who had a bizarre public meltdown earlier this month, is not. Other notables: Rupert Murdoch (though not James), Stephen Colbert (but not Jon Stewart), Ellen DeGeneres (but not Portia) and Tim Tebow (but not Mark Sanchez). One meta media note: Mashable founder Pete Cashmore—whose site was rumored to be close to a sale earlier this month to Time-corporate sibling CNN--is on the ballot. As is custom, the poll winner will be included in the issue—though the full Time 100 list is chosen by editors.

Ted Nugent performs at a concert at the House of Blues at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada in this file image from August 11, 2007. REUTERS/Steve Marcus OKLAHOMA CITY Musician and gun-rights advocate Ted Nugent said on Thursday he had a positive meeting with U.S. Secret Service agents investigating his recent criticism of President Barack Obama, and the agency confirmed the issue had been resolved. Nugent, who told NRA supporters in St. Louis last week that he would be "dead or in jail" next year if Obama was reelected, said in a statement that he had "met with two fine, professional Secret Service agents" in Oklahoma. "Good, solid, professional meeting concluding that I have never made any threats of violence towards anyone. The meeting could not have gone better," the 63-year-old singer and guitarist said. The Secret Service, which is tasked with protecting the U.S. president, senior officials and other figures, confirmed the meeting with Nugent. Nugent, a Michigan-born conservative who has endorsed Obama's presumed Republican challenger in the November elections, Mitt Romney, drew Secret Service attention with his blunt remarks about Obama and administration officials at the NRA event. U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, responded earlier this week, saying "threatening violence - or whatever it is that Nugent's threatening - is clearly beyond the pale." A Romney spokeswoman said the Republican candidate believed "everyone needs to be civil," but stopped short of condemning Nugent's original remarks.

Facebook acquires Instagram for US$1 billion
Keith Bedford/Bloomberg News Instagram, an Internet start-up in San Francisco, has no revenue and about a dozen employees. But to Facebook , it is already worth a billion dollars. Facebook announced on Monday that it would pay that much in cash and stock for Instagram, the latest big winner in an industry that seems to be more awash in money by the day. The acquisition, which is Facebook’s largest to date, could give it a stronger position on mobile devices. Instagram is essentially a social network built around photography, offering mobile apps that let people add quirky effects to their smartphone snapshots and share them with friends. It has dozens of competitors, but Instagram stands out for its fast ascension and almost cultlike following. It has 30 million users who upload more than five million photos a day, even though it was available for only Apple devices until last week, when the company released an Android app. For Instagram’s founders, two Stanford graduates in their 20s who are now worth in the tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars, it has been a productive couple of years. “It’s the Web fairy tale that all start-ups dream of,” said Melissa Parrish, an analyst with Forrester Research , who added: “They took a simple behavior — sharing pictures with friends — and made it a utility that people want.” Facebook is getting ready for its own big payday. That means it can easily afford Instagram’s price, if only to keep a rising star out of the hands of competitors like Google . Facebook may also need Instagram to help it keep up with the constantly changing whims of the online audience.

SLIDESHOW: Indonesia quakes spark tsunami fears, click here Indonesia said it was checking for damage and casualties but remarkably, no such reports had been received for several hours after the quakes, including in Aceh, the closest province and the area decimated by the disaster eight years ago. However, some areas close to the epicentre are remote so it could take some time to find out if there was any damage. "It's dark out here but I am scared to go home," said Mila, a 41-year-old woman taking refuge in the grand mosque in the town of Banda Aceh, the provincial capital. We are human, it is only natural that we have fear, but I really wish we will all be safe." Waves of up to one metre (3.3 feet) high were seen near islands off Aceh, but Indonesia cancelled a warning for fresh tsunamis.

Nine Peruvians rescued from collapsed mine
Story highlights Humala renews his call to regulate illegal mines The nine miners had been trapped since the mine collapsed Thursday The president was waiting to greet them as they emerged into the daylight In 2010, 33 miners were rescued after being trapped underground for 69 days in Chile Nine Peruvian miners emerged into the daylight Wednesday morning after six days trapped in a collapsed mine. State television showed the miners leaving the mine, each supported by two rescuers. They wore sunglasses to protect their eyes from the light, after spending so much time in darkness. For days, a tube snaked down to the collapsed cavern was the only connection the miners had to the surface. It provided them with oxygen, food and water, as well as communication. The group unfurled the red and white Peruvian flag and waved at television cameras. "We are happy that this high-risk operation was successful," said Claudio Saenz, a fire department official with knowledge of the rescue efforts. The miners had been stuck since Thursday in the wildcat Cabeza de Negro mine in southern Peru. Humala's government has made a push for illegal mines and miners in Peru to be formalized and regulated so that risks decrease. "This should lead us to reflect that we have to avoid these kind of risks because the results will not always be like today," he said. Mining is big business in Peru, which is a major world producer of copper, silver, gold and other minerals.

Tulsa shootings accused face multiple murder charges
Image caption Memorials for those killed in the Good Friday shootings have appeared in Tulsa Two men accused of shooting five black people, three fatally, in the Oklahoma city of Tulsa have been charged with murder and hate crimes. Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 32, were officially charged with three counts of first-degree murder as well as malicious harassment based on race. Both men have confessed to the series of shootings on 6 April, according to a police affidavit. They were arrested at home near Tulsa after a tip-off. "Filing charges is the first step to obtain justice for the victims and their families," Tulsa County attorney Doug Drummond said in a statement. Our office is committed to holding those responsible accountable for their actions." The two were also charged with two counts of shooting with intent to kill. Image caption Jake England and Alvin Watts were living in this property north of Tulsa where they were arrested Their next court date is expected on 16 April. Two men wounded in the attacks, David Hall, 46, and Deon Tucker, 44, have since been released from hospital. The affidavit, quoted by the Associated Press news agency, does not make clear which man shot which victim, but suggests that Mr England admitted to shooting three people and Mr Watts confessed to shooting two. None of the victims are thought to have known each other and all of them were out walking when they were shot within a three-mile (4.8-km) radius early on 6 April. Carl England was shot in the chest in April 2010 during a fight with Pernell Demond Jefferson, a black man who allegedly tried to break into the apartment of Mr England's daughter's boyfriend.

China, UN rebuke North Korea for rocket launch
China has joined other world powers in warning North Korea that they will not tolerate any more provocations after the isolated nation's failed rocket launch last week. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said late Monday in Brasilia that the U.N. Security Council members, including China, are agreed there will be "further consequences" in the event of another provocative act by North Korea. Recent satellite photographs show Pyongyang may be preparing for an underground nuclear test. China's state-controlled media are also showing signs of frustration with Pyongyang, noting that China took "a clear attitude in condemning" its longtime ally when it backed a U.N. Security Council statement criticizing the rocket launch. China's Communist Party-controlled Global Times newspaper said Tuesday that Pyongyang should not be misled into thinking it can ignore Beijing's wishes with impunity. The paper said North Korea will "pay the price if it tries to abduct China's North Korea policy." In its unanimous statement Monday, the Security Council condemned Friday's rocket launch as a "serious violation" of existing U.N. resolutions, and ordered its sanctions committee to tighten measures aimed at preventing North Korea from developing and exporting nuclear and missile technology. Pyongyang had announced the failed launch as an effort to put a weather satellite into orbit, but the United States and other countries condemned it as a covert attempt to test a ballistic missile that could later be used to fire a nuclear warhead. Japanese media reported Tuesday that Pyongyang has also withdrawn an invitation for International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to visit its facilities in retaliation for the U.S. cancelation of a food aid package. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice, who heads the Security Council this month, said in New York Monday that the failed space shot had caused "grave security concerns" across much of East Asia. "The swift and unanimous adoption of this strong presidential statement shows that the international community is united in sending a clear message to North Korea that such provocations are serious and totally unacceptable. Critically, the Security Council made clear there will be consequences for any further North Korean launch or nuclear test," she said.

Former Ukranian PM Yulia Tymoshenko goes on hunger strike
Image copyright AFP Image caption Yulia Tymoshenko is serving a seven-year sentence in prison Yulia Tymoshenko, the former Ukrainian prime minister serving a prison sentence for abuse of office, has reportedly gone on hunger strike. Her fast began on Friday, lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko told Interfax news agency, speaking outside the walls of her prison in the eastern city of Kharkiv. She is serving seven years in prison for abuse of office, a conviction which caused dismay in the West. Reports say she has been suffering back pain for months. Mr Vlasenko was quoted by Interfax as saying Tymoshenko was protesting against "what is happening in the country and what is happening to her in prison". She had, he said, suffered bruising to her arms and stomach as a result of being moved from the prison to a hospital on Friday. 'Confined to bed' The lawyer denied his client had refused to allow doctors to examine her but he added that she had been put in hospital against her will. The day before she was taken to hospital, Tymoshenko had been due to attend a new trial for tax evasion. However, she refused to attend, citing problems with her health.

Liberian ex-President Charles Taylor convicted in war crimes trial
Image caption Taylor, a former warlord, was elected president of Liberia in 1997 International judges have found former Liberian leader Charles Taylor guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes during the Sierra Leone civil war. Taylor, 64, has been on trial in The Hague at the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone for almost five years. He was accused of backing rebels who killed tens of thousands of people in Sierra Leone's 1991-2002 civil war. Taylor was convicted on 11 counts including terror, murder and rape - but cleared of ordering the crimes. He is the first former head of state convicted by an international court since the Nuremburg military tribunal of Nazis after World War II. "This is an incredibly significant decision," Elise Keppler from the campaign group Human Rights Watch told the BBC. Analysis The indictment of Charles Taylor took war crimes jurisprudence to a new level, establishing the principle that a serving head of state was not immune from prosecution. Mr Gbagbo, who shares a prison compound in The Hague with Taylor, will undoubtedly feel less sanguine about the outcome of his trial as a result. The US State Department said the ruling sent "a strong message to all perpetrators of atrocities, including those in the highest positions of power, that they will be held accountable".

"I'm for Mitt Romney," Bush told ABC News this morning as the doors of an elevator closed on him, after he gave a speech on human rights a block from his old home - the White House. Bush's endorsement isn't a surprise, given that Romney is virtually the Republican Party's nominee. But the 43rd president has been absent from the 2012 campaign and hasn't made any public comments showing his support for Romney. Romney did get the formal backing of Bush's parents, President George H.W. People who worked in the Bush administration say they doubt the former president will be campaigning for Romney this year. Even in his post-presidential life, Bush still gets a lot of the blame for the poor economy, according to polls, though he has become more popular since leaving office. Bush was speaking today at an event to promote the George W. Bush Presidential Center's campaign for human rights activists around the world.

Obama's new stance on same-sex marriage earns donations
(AP) NEW YORK - President Barack Obama has seen an uptick in fundraising since he announced his shift on gay marriage, with some Democratic rainmakers citing renewed interest from gay and lesbian donors who had been urging the president to clarify his stance on the divisive social issue. "The phone calls went on until one in the morning after the president spoke  people calling saying `Where do I go, what can I do to help, what events are coming up,"' said Robert Zimmerman, a Long Island, N.Y., Obama bundler. "People I've been seeking out for campaign support for months have been calling me saying, `I'm ready to give."' Obama's campaign has declined to say how much it has collected since the announcement but some staffers have asked supporters to give money as a way of expressing their approval. Following the Obama interview with ABC News, Rufus Gifford, Obama's national finance director, said in a posting to the campaign website that "if you're proud of our president, this is a great time to make a donation to the campaign." Chad Griffin, an Obama bundler and incoming president of the gay advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, said most prominent gay donors had been supporting Obama all along despite his reluctance to champion gay marriage. Most had already given the maximum contribution to his campaign, Griffin said. But he said Obama's announcement had boosted enthusiasm among many gay donors.

China's 'Bandit King' given life term in 'massive' bribery case
At its peak in the 1990s, Lai Changxing's smuggling empire transported chemicals, cooking oil, tobacco and cars. He had hundreds of police, customs officers and government officials on his payroll in the southern port city of Xiamen, which he ran like his own personal fiefdom. But the law finally caught up with Lai: he was sentenced yesterday to life in prison for smuggling and bribery in a corruption case that reached into the highest echelons of the Communist Party and involved a 12-year extradition battle with Canada. "The crimes involve massive sums and particularly serious circumstances," court officials told the Xinhua news agency. Between 1995 and 1999, Lai's company, Yuanhua, oversaw the smuggling of £2.64bn worth of goods, officials said, with the loss in revenues to Chinese customs estimated at £1.36bn. Despite some public anger that the crime boss was apparently operating with impunity, Lai cultivated the image of a Chinese Robin Hood, and was often referred to as the "Bandit King". In his heyday he built football stadiums and handed out wads of cash to the poor. But following an investigation he fled China, initially heading to Hong Kong and arriving in Canada in 1999. The extradition battle was drawn out because Lai claimed he would be tortured and executed amid fears that he might implicate senior officials. Among the high-profile figures caught up in the scandal were Li Jizhou, China's former vice-security minister, who was given a suspended death sentence, the deputy mayor of Xiamen, and the wife of Jia Qinglin, the Fujian province party secretary until 1996 and an ally of then-president Jiang Zemin.

Charles Taylor gets 50 years for war crimes
If carried out, the sentence is likely to mean that Mr. Taylor, 64, will spend the rest of his life in prison. He looked at the floor after he was asked to stand as the sentence was read. Photo The chief prosecutor, Brenda Hollis, told a news conference that could be viewed in West Africa: “The sentence today does not replace amputated limbs; it does not bring back those who were murdered,” she said. “It does not heal the wounds of those who were raped or forced to become sexual slaves.” Mr. Taylor’s legal team said it would file an appeal. “The sentence is clearly excessive, clearly disproportionate to his circumstances, his age and his health, and does not take into account the fact that he stepped down from office voluntarily,” said Morris Anya, one of Mr. Taylor’s lawyers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The prosecution, which had sought an even longer sentence of 80 years, said it was considering its own appeal, to raise the level of responsibility attributed to Mr. Taylor for crimes committed under his leadership. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Two rebel commanders tried earlier were handed similar prison sentences of 50 and 52 years, and a prosecutor said Mr. Taylor’s overall responsibility for the atrocities was considerably greater. He did not freely leave office, but was pushed out in 2003 as rebels marched on his capital and a delegation of African leaders urged him to prevent further bloodshed and seek exile in Nigeria.

By previous agreement, Mr. Taylor will serve his sentence in a British prison, but since the appeals process is expected to last at least a year, he will remain in the relative comfort of the United Nations’ detention center at The Hague. After more than a year of deliberations, the Special Court for Sierra Leone found Mr. Taylor guilty in late April of crimes against humanity and war crimes for his part in fomenting widespread brutality that included murder, rape, the use of child soldiers, the mutilation of thousands of civilians and the mining of diamonds to pay for guns and ammunition.

* Romney raises nearly $5 million after court ruling * Adds "greater urgency" to election * White House calls mandate levy a penalty, not tax By Steve Holland WASHINGTON, June 29 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney took his fight against President Barack Obama's newly upheld healthcare law out on the campaign trail on Friday, attempting to use it to galvanize support for his bid to oust Obama on Nov. 6. Campaign supporters of Obama sought to blunt Republican criticism that the law will amount to a new tax increase on Americans. A 5-4 majority of U.S. Supreme Court justices ruled the law constitutional on Thursday by saying it falls under Congress' authority to levy taxes. Romney, at a fundraiser in New York, said the court's decision calls for "greater urgency, I believe, in the election" and that in order to replace Obama's healthcare law "you've got to replace President Obama." His supporters have responded, pouring nearly $5 million in campaign donations in little more than 24 hours since the ruling was unveiled. Obama's campaign insisted Obama had raised more but did not disclose a number. Obama's court victory protects his landmark domestic policy achievement but also leaves him open to election-year attacks from Republicans who say the law kills jobs by putting a burden on small businesses. A ruling by the court that the centerpiece of Obama's law - the "individual mandate" which requires Americans to have health insurance - is in fact a tax, gives Republicans an extra stick with which to hit the Democratic incumbent. The White House and Obama's campaign argued the court was wrong to label it a tax. Only about 1 percent of Americans would likely fall under this category, the administration said. "So your choice is to purchase health care reform or a penalty will be administered," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One. The Supreme Court ruling fell in the midst of a tense period in the presidential campaign with Obama and Romney running closely in opinion polls and trying to define each other as unfit for the White House. In a sign of the bitterness of the fight, the Romney campaign on Friday issued an ad featuring Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticizing Obama during the 2008 campaign.

U.S. Supreme Court upholds health care mandate
ET (CBS News) In a historic decision, the Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the critical piece of President Obama's Affordable Care Act, the individual mandate. By upholding the individual mandate -- the requirement for all Americans to acquire health insurance -- the court kept what many described as the "heart" of the law. The decision creates some certainty surrounding federal health care policy, allowing federal and state rulemakers to implement the law. The decision was 5 - 4, with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the liberal justices and writing the majority opinion. The court ruled that the federal government does have the power to require all Americans to acquire insurance if the "fine" imposed on those who don't is considered a tax. Complete Coverage: Health Care Read the Supreme Court's full decision "I see this as a total victory for the Affordable Care Act," said Tim Jost, a consumer advocate and professor of health law at Washington and Lee University. Additionally, he said, the ruling is "a signal to the states that it's time to get going." The states have until November 16 to turn in blueprints for building their respective state health exchange systems. The court found fault with one major provision of the law, which would have expanded Medicaid coverage. In 2014, the Affordable Care Act would have opened up Medicaid to anyone with an income under 138 percent of the federal poverty line. If a state had chosen not to expand the program as the law required, it would have had to opt out of Medicaid completely -- something no state could afford to do. The court ruled that the federal government's ability to revoke a state's Medicaid funding is limited -- thus, the states can opt into the expansion, but they don't have to.

The Democrats have picked San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro to deliver their convention’s keynote address in Charlotte, N.C., in September, a move that underscores the premium the party puts on mobilizing votes from the country’s burgeoning Hispanic population. The up-and-coming 37-year-old mayor–dubbed by some as a potential future presidential candidate–will become the first Hispanic to deliver a party’s keynote address when he takes the stage on the first night of the three-day convention. Former President Bill Clinton will give the main address the next night, competing with the first game of the NFL season. In a video clip released Wednesday to announce his speaking role, Mr. Castro reminisces about Barack Obama’s breakthrough keynote address at the 2004 Democratic convention, when the little-known legislator from Illinois wowed his party with a speech about an idealized America undivided along partisan or racial lines. Presumptive Republican candidate says US must use 'any and all measures' to prevent Tehran developing nuclear weapons Mitt Romney has made a staunch declaration of unity with Israel against the Iranian nuclear threat, pledging that the US "will not look away" in the face of an existential challenge against the Jewish state.

We recognise Israel's right to defend itself, and it is right for America to stand with you," said Romney. Echoing Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu's comparisons between a nuclear Iran and the Holocaust, Romney said: "We have seen the horrors of history. He denounced the Iranian regime as a "radical theocracy", saying it was the "leading state sponsor of terrorism and the most destabilising nation in the world". "If Israel has to take action on its own, in order to stop Iran from developing that capability, the governor would respect that decision," Dan Senor, Romney's senior national security aide, told reporters.

Romney taps U.S. congressman Paul Ryan as presidential running mate
NORFOLK, Va.—Mitt Romney picked Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate, a decision that could spark enthusiasm for the Republican ticket among conservatives and all but ensures the election will turn to deep philosophical divisions between the two parties over spending, taxes and entitlements. In Mr. Ryan, 42 years old, the Romney campaign gets a conservative who has spent recent years at the center of national debates about the size and scope of the federal government. With his proposals to revamp entitlement programs for... 2 was steeped in secrecy As Romney and Ryan planned a second day of joint appearances on Sunday in North Carolina, some of the layers of secrecy surrounding the most monumental decision the Republican candidate has made to date are being peeled back. CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Paul Ryan's path to becoming Mitt Romney's Republican vice presidential running mate was steeped in secrecy, from an incognito trip to meet Romney to a furtive walk through the woods near his boyhood Wisconsin home. The head of Romney's VP search process, longtime confidante Beth Myers, broke her silence on many details in a briefing with reporters inside a hangar at Dulles International Airport near Washington. Romney and Ryan themselves spoke to reporters briefly on their flight to North Carolina. The search was so confidential that background information on a short list of candidates, including several years of tax returns and other documents, were kept in a safe in a locked room at Romney's campaign headquarters and the few people allowed in were not permitted to make copies or take anything out. What began in April as a long list of candidates was winnowed down to a short list by May 1. After extensive deliberations over his short list, Romney settled on the 42-year-old Wisconsin congressman who has built a conservative record as a budget hawk in Washington.

US astronaut Neil Armstrong dies
US astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man on the Moon, has died aged 82. A statement from his family says he died from complications from heart surgery he had earlier this month. He set foot on the Moon on 20 July 1969, famously describing the event as "one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind". US President Barack Obama said Armstrong was "among the greatest of American heroes - not just of his time, but of all time". Last November he received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest US civilian award. Image caption Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the Moon, has died aged 82.

In 1971, he left the US space agency Nasa to teach aerospace engineering. Born in 1930 and raised in Ohio, Armstrong took his first flight aged six with his father and formed a lifelong passion for flying.

Human Rights Watch publish documents alleging US cooperated with Libya on torture
Story highlights An expert says torture claims have been part of an anti-U.S. "propaganda war" The CIA says it can't comment on the allegations in a Human Rights Watch report Human Rights Watch says it has proof of CIA abuses against Libyans Allegations challenge claims by George W. Bush's administration that only 3 people waterboarded An alleged new case of waterboarding emerged in a massive report Thursday detailing brutal CIA interrogations of Libyan detainees last decade before they were handed over to Moammar Gadhafi's regime. Mohammed al-Shoroeiya "provided detailed and credible testimony that he was waterboarded on repeated occasions during U.S. interrogations in Afghanistan," Human Rights Watch said in a 200-plus page report. The allegations directly challenge long-standing claims by President George W. Bush and his administration that only three terror suspects, none of whom were Libyan, were waterboarded during interrogations. Human rights groups consider waterboarding -- in which a prisoner is restrained and water poured over his mouth and nose to produce the sensation of drowning -- a form of torture. "While never using the phrase 'waterboarding,' he said that after his captors put a hood over his head and strapped him onto a wooden board, 'then they start with the water pouring. They start to pour water to the point where you feel like you are suffocating.' He added that 'they wouldn't stop until they got some kind of answer from me,'" the report said. CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said she couldn't comment on the report's "specific allegations" but said the CIA has been on record about "three substantiated cases in which detainees were subjected to the waterboarding technique." "The Department of Justice has exhaustively reviewed the treatment of more than 100 detainees in the post-9/11 period -- including allegations involving unauthorized interrogation techniques -- and it declined prosecution in every case," she said.

On the campaign trail, September 2012
President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Friday by telephone, ending the call with a common pledge to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon but no apparent consensus on a specific timeline to do so. A few hours later, Republican nominee Mitt Romney spoke by phone with Netanyahu, his one-time consulting colleague and a friend since the 1970s. After the call, Romney said that he does not believe military force will have to be used to stop Iran’s uranium enrichment program. The dueling calls again edged Israel and Iran into the frame of the presidential election, and they gave both candidates an opportunity to outline their positions on an crucial security issue. According to a summary of the roughly 20-minute call released by the White House, Obama and Netanyahu “underscored that they are in full agreement on the shared goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.” The statement also said the leaders, who have clashed over the now-dormant Palestinian peace process but rarely over Israeli security concerns, “agreed to continue their regular consultations on this issue going forward.” The call came a day after Netanyahu told the U.N. General Assembly that Iran’s nuclear program would produce enough enriched uranium to make a weapon by spring or summer. Using a cartoon image of a bomb to make his point, Netanyahu urged world leaders to present Iran with a “red line” that, if crossed, would result in a military strike. While delivered on a global stage, Netanyahu’s address was also aimed at Obama, who in his speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday spelled out the dangers that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to the region and beyond. Although the president reiterated his position that the United States will do “what we must” to prevent that from happening, Obama declined to specify what steps by Iran would trigger a military operation. Iran denies that it is enriching uranium for a weapon, but Israel and the United States do not believe the claim. According to the White House summary of Friday’s call, Netanyahu “welcomed President Obama’s commitment before the United Nations General Assembly.” The leaders spoke by phone because Obama, just six weeks from the election, declined to meet with any foreign leaders at the General Assembly this year.

The blue-eyed Williams, who continued touring and drawing crowds to his Moon River Theater in the music hub of Branson into his 80s, died on Tuesday evening after a yearlong battle with bladder cancer, his family said in a statement. Williams had 18 gold record and three platinum hits and in his peak years was a regular on television with his own variety series. President Ronald Reagan called his voice "a national treasure." Williams was born on December 3, 1927, in tiny Wall Lake, Iowa, and was singing professionally with three older brothers at age 8. Williams went solo after the group broke up in 1951, drew attention with his appearances on "The Tonight Show" and began recording. Later hits included "Born Free," "Days of Wine and Roses," "The Shadow of Your Smile," "Can't Get Used to Losing You," "Solitaire," "Music to Watch Girls By," "Can't Take My Eyes Off of You" and the theme from the 1970 movie hit "Love Story." He came upon his signature song when asked to sing "Moon River" at the 1962 Academy Awards ceremony.

More than 67 million people watched the first presidential debate between… (Charlie Neibergall / Associated…) A huge audience -- an estimated 67.2 million people -- watched the first presidential debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney on Wednesday, according to ratings firm Nielsen. The crowd levels represent a 28% increase over viewership for the first debate four years ago between then-Sen. Obama and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). That debate, in September 2008, garnered an audience of 52.4 million viewers. Wednesday night's event was carried live from the University of Denver in Colorado across nearly a dozen channels.

On the campaign trail, October 2012
(CBS News) Former Secretary of State Colin Powell broke with the Republican party during the 2008 election, to endorse then-candidate Barack Obama for president, calling Obama a "transformational figure." With 12 days to go before the presidential election, Powell publicly endorsed President Obama for re-election on "CBS This Morning" Thursday "I voted for him in 2008 and I plan to stick with him in 2012 and I'll be voting for he and for Vice President Joe Biden next month." Powell explained his choice to Charlie Rose and Norah O'Donnell: When he took over, the country was in very very difficult straits. We were in the one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to a depression. Wall Street was in chaos, we had 800,000 jobs lost in that first month of the Obama administration and unemployment peaked a few months later at 10 percent. The auto industry was collapsing, the housing was start[ing] to collapse and we were in very difficult straits. And I saw over the next several years, stabilization come back in the financial community, housing is now starting to pick up after four years, it's starting to pick up. Summarizing the past four years under Obama, Powell said "Generally we've come out of the dive and we're starting to gain altitude." He acknowledged that problems remain, saying "The unemployment rate is too high, people are still hurting in housing but I see that we're starting to rise up." Turning to foreign policy, Powell said he saw "the president get us of one war, start to get us out of a second war and did not get us into any new wars.

Actor and television host Gary Collins dies aged 74
Gary Collins, an actor who was the longtime host of the syndicated TV show “Hour Magazine” and a former master of ceremonies for the Miss America Pageant, died early Saturday in Biloxi, Miss. Collins died of natural causes soon after arriving at Biloxi Regional Medical Center, Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove told the Associated Press. In 2011 Collins moved to Mississippi, the home state of his wife, Mary Ann Mobley, an actress and Miss America 1959. He had been arrested and fined last year for leaving a Biloxi restaurant without paying his dinner tab; in 2007 and 2009 he was convicted in separate DUI cases in California. PHOTOS: Notable Deaths of 2012 | Classic TV From 1980 to 1988, Collins served as host of the TV talk show “Hour Magazine,” a gentler version of the genre that avoided some of the controversial topics tackled by Phil Donahue, Geraldo Rivera and other tabloid programs. Legendary TV actor and host, Gary Collins, passed away early this morning in Biloxi, Miss., at the age of 74. Appearing on hit shows, such as "JAG," "Charlie's Angels," "Fantasy Island" and "The Love Boat," Collins was best known for hosting the talk show "Hour Magazine" from 1980 to 1988. He also hosted the Miss America Pageant from 1985 to 1989.

Attorney General vetos release of Prince Charles correspondence
Image caption Prince Charles' letters were sent between September 2004 and April 2005 Attorney General Dominic Grieve has blocked the release of private letters the Prince of Wales sent to seven government departments. A court ruled last month that the correspondence should be published. But Mr Grieve said it was an exceptional case where the letters formed part of the prince's "preparations for kingship". The Guardian said it would seek to take the government to the High Court to challenge the veto . The Republic group called the ruling an "affront to democracy" which was "all about protecting Charles and the Royal Family from scrutiny". 'Practical benefit' In his report, Mr Grieve said: "The ability of the Monarch to engage with the government of the day, whatever its political colour, and maintain political neutrality is a cornerstone of the UK's constitutional framework." The Administrative Appeals Chamber said last month that in its view, it was in the public interest "for there to be transparency as to how and when Prince Charles seeks to influence government". Analysis Prince Charles and his officials will be relieved the government has come to the aid of the future king. One day of partially submerged headlines - the announcement has been made on a particularly busy news day - is preferable to several days devoted to the prince's thinking and style of writing. The 27 letters, we now know from the attorney general, are "particularly frank" and if published would "potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality". This is enough for his critics to once again accuse the heir to the throne of meddling behind the scenes. He is, after all, the royal a former senior aide once described as a "dissident" working against "current political opinion". Those around Charles insist he mobilises, rather than meddles; he's entitled to contact ministers in private; and his way of operating will change once he ascends to the throne. Mr Evans wanted to see letters between Prince Charles and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department of Health, the Department for Children, Schools and Families (which is now the Department for Education), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Northern Ireland Office and the Cabinet Office.

U.S. prepares for arrival of Hurricane Sandy
If so, share your images and footage with CNN iReport, but please stay safe. (CNN) -- Though no longer a hurricane, "post-tropical" superstorm Sandy packed a hurricane-sized punch as it slammed into the Jersey Shore on Monday, killing at least 11 people from West Virginia to North Carolina and Connecticut. Sandy whipped torrents of water over the streets of Atlantic City, stretching for blocks inland and ripping up part of the vacation spot's fabled boardwalk. The storm surge set records in Lower Manhattan, where flooded substations caused a widespread power outage. It swamped beachfronts on both sides of Long Island Sound and delivered hurricane-force winds from Virginia to Cape Cod as it came ashore. "We are having intermittent telephone access issues, and for this reason the receiving hospital will notify the families of their arrival," spokeswoman Lisa Greiner said. In addition, the basement of New York's Bellevue Hospital Center flooded, and the hospital was running off of emergency backup power. Ian Michaels of the Office of Emergency Management said the main priority is to help secure additional power and obtain additional fuel and pumps for the hospital. It packed 80-mph winds at landfall, down from the 90 mph clocked earlier Monday. It's unbelievable," said Montgomery Dahm, owner of the Tun Tavern in Atlantic City, which stayed open as Sandy neared the Jersey Shore.

Freddie Starr arrested as part of Savile child sex inquiry
The 69-year-old comedian and entertainer was arrested at 5.45pm on suspicion of sexual offences and taken into police custody close to his Warwickshire home. A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: “Officers working on Operation Yewtree have this evening, Thursday 1 November, arrested a man in his 60s in connection with the investigation. “The man, from Warwickshire, was arrested at approximately 17.45 hrs on suspicion of sexual offences, and has been taken into police custody locally. The individual falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed 'Savile and others'.” Starr is the second person to be arrested in connection with the Savile abuse scandal after shamed singer Gary Glitter was questioned on Sunday. Police launched a criminal investigation into the Savile abuse claims after it emerged that allegations had been made against a number of living people. Starr, who lives in Warwickshire with his 34-year-old fiancée, Sophie Lea, was implicated in the scandal after a woman alleged on an ITV documentary that he had molested her when she was a 14-year-old. Karin Ward claimed Starr had groped her when she had appeared on the television show Clunk Click with Jimmy Savile in the 1970s. Starr initially denied ever having met Mrs Ward, but later changed his story, when footage appeared of them on the programme together. Starr has vehemently denied ever sexually assaulting anyone and last week spoke of his willingness to be interviewed by police in order to clear his name. Detectives are have identified more than 300 alleged victims of abuse which have been broken down into three categories; those who were abused by Savile, those who were abused by Savile and other and those who were abused by others.

The Democratic incumbent is campaigning in three key election states, while his Republican rival Mitt Romney held rallies in Virginia. Mr Obama told voters not to be fooled by his challenger, who has been trying to seize the mantle of change. The election is neck and neck, both nationally and in key state contests. Last month's report showed the US jobless rate falling below 8% for the first time in several years. Mr Obama held off campaigning for three days this week as he directed the federal response to the super-storm Sandy. "Governor Romney has been using all his talents as a salesman to dress up these very same policies that failed our country so badly - the very same policies we've been cleaning up after for the past four years - and he is offering them up as change," Mr Obama said. The Romney campaign has released a new ad attacking the president for proposing the creation of a secretary of business post to co-ordinate the response to the nation's economic woes.

United States re-elects Barack Obama
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Barack Obama: "I have never been more hopeful" President Barack Obama has been re-elected to a second term, defeating Republican challenger Mitt Romney. America's first black president secured more than the 270 votes in the electoral college needed to win. In his victory speech before supporters in Chicago, Mr Obama said he would talk to Mr Romney about "where we can work together to move this country forward". Mr Obama prevailed despite lingering dissatisfaction with the economy and a hard-fought challenge by Mr Romney. The Republicans kept control of the House of Representatives, which analysts say will likely result in more of the gridlock that characterised Mr Obama's first term, with the House and the president at loggerheads on most legislation. In his address, the president challenged his opponents, asking them to work with him. With only Florida's 29 electoral votes still undecided, Mr Obama won 303 electoral votes to Mr Romney's 206. The popular vote, which is symbolically and politically important but not decisive in the race, remains very close. Both candidates said this was a choice of two visions - America has chosen 'One nation' speech Mr Obama congratulated Mr Romney and Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan on their hard-fought campaign. "We have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come," he said. Mr Obama said he was returning to the White House "more determined, and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do, and the future that lies ahead". In Boston, where his campaign was based, Mr Romney congratulated the president and said he and Mr Ryan had "left everything on the field" and had given their all in the campaign.

While the state already has a law barring same-sex marriage, conservatives hoped to prevent a future Legislature or court decision from reversing it. In Washington State, supporters of a referendum authorizing same-sex marriage appeared to have an edge in pre-election polls, but final results were not expected until later this week because ballots were still being mailed in as late as Tuesday.

World leaders react to Obama win
Netanyahu paid tribute to 'rock solid' ties between the US and Israel. Many Israelis are worried about how the frosty first-term relationship will affect Obama's actions during his second term. In this March 5 file photo, President Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to congratulate President Obama on his reelection by paying tribute to an US-Israel alliance that, in his words, is "rock solid," though the upbeat statement belied widespread anxiety by Israelis that the leaders’ rocky relations would continue to cloud ties. Now that Mr. Obama is free of the constraints of reelection, Israelis worry that he will feel less compelled to mollify Mr. Netanyahu on disputes over the Palestinian peace process and blocking Iran’s nuclear program. Obama has pushed Israel to renew talks with the Palestinians and has refused a request from Netanyahu to publicly set a "red line" for military action against Iran’s nuclear program. Alluding to the tension with language that seemed lifted from GOP candidate Mitt Romney's talking points, parliament member Danny Danon, a member of Netanyahu's Likud Party, expressed hope the president "resets his course relating to Israel and our region for the next four years. Rather than dictating ill-advised policies that endanger the wellbeing of America's only true ally in the Middle East, now is the time for President Obama to return to the wise and time-honored policy of 'zero daylight' between our respective nations.'' If Obama pushes more diplomatic talks with Iran while allowing it to continue to enrich uranium, sore spots with the US are likely persist like they did late into the election campaign, says one political expert.

UK Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to investigate Nadine Dorries reality TV appearance
PM says suspension was 'right thing to do' as parliamentary watchdog examines complaint about MP's absence to appear on I'm A Celebrity David Cameron has defended the decision of the Conservative party to suspend Nadine Dorries for leaving Westminster to appear on a reality show, insisting it was the "right thing to do". The prime minister made his comments as it emerged that the Westminster watchdog is considering whether to investigate a complaint it received over her decision to take part in I'm a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here. Dorries's forthcoming appearance on the jungle-based reality show, which starts on Sunday and is set to earn the MP for Mid Bedfordshire £40,000, could take her away from her constituency and parliamentary duties for up to a month. Speaking on ITV's This Morning, the prime minister, who came back from a trip to the Middle East on Wednesday afternoon, confirmed that he, like other colleagues, had not been informed that Dorries was planning to appear on I'm a Celebrity. He said the chief whip, Sir George Young, had taken the "very sensible decision" to ensure she is "no longer a Conservative MP". "The chief whip took the view – and I back this completely – that she had made the decision to go out and do this programme and that meant she couldn't be in parliament, she couldn't represent her constituents and I think people do expect MPs to be doing either one or two of those things, particularly when parliament is sitting." Dorries has insisted that Cameron, with whom she has repeatedly clashed, would be glad to see the back of her. "I am a thorn in his side," she said. While fellow elected MPs prepared for a normal working day on Thursday, a topless Dorries was photographed sunbathing in Queensland as she relaxed before the programme goes on air this weekend. The parliamentary commissioner for standards, John Lyon, will examine a complaint received about whether she may have breached the code of conduct for MPs by being absent from the Commons.

'Gangnam Style' YouTube view count passes one billion
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Rory Cellan Jones on the Gangnam phenomenon Gangnam Style has become the first video to clock up more than one billion views on YouTube. The South Korean dance track was posted online in July, propelling pop star Psy to worldwide fame. It has inspired hundreds of parody clips, from members of the British army, Thai navy and Minecraft gamers, among others. YouTube's owner, Google, said the video had been watched seven million to 10 million times a day on average. "Psy's success is a great testament to the universal appeal of catchy music - and er, great equine dance moves," wrote Kevin Allocca, YouTube trends manager, on the service's blog. Globalised Gangnam Image caption The video's YouTube hit counter added a dancing Psy animation after it hit the one billion milestone One industry watcher said the fact so many people continued to post their own versions of Gangnam Style had played a huge part in the clip's success. "I've seen a statistic which reckons the one song will have generated something like $8m [£5m] by the end of the year from money that comes directly from YouTube through advertising plus download sales, its uses in adverts and TV programmes," Chris Cooke, business editor of the CMU music news site, told the BBC. "It shows that YouTube - which is a free-to-use as a promotional platform for the music labels - can lead to substantial income. I don't know whether it's a template that can be copied, but it certainly shows how quickly an eye-catching clip can spread thanks to social networks and YouTube." Sir Martin Sorrell - chief executive of advertising giant WPP - paid tribute to the achievement by making a link between Psy and one of the west's most influential economists. "Another great example of Theodore Levitt's 'globalisation' and the power of K-pop," he told the BBC.

Tanks, APCs deployed to presidential palace in Cairo, Egypt after deadly clashes
At least seven people have been killed and more than 770 injured in clashes outside the presidential palace in Cairo. Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi expressed sorrow for ongoing violent protests outside his palace and called for dialogue in a speech on Thursday night, but offered no concessions to Egypt's increasingly polarised opposition. Seven people were killed, and more than 770 injured, during hours of clashes outside the presidential palace on Wednesday. Supporters of the president attacked a group of opposition protesters staging a peaceful sit-in outside the palace, using firebombs, clubs and guns, according to witnesses. In his speech, Morsi called the violence "regrettable," and blamed it on "infiltrators" funded by unnamed third parties. "Such painful events happened because of political differences that should be resolved through dialogue," he said. His speech, still ongoing, comes amidst ongoing unrest in the Egyptian capital. The violence that had stretched from Wednesday afternoon into the early hours of Thursday had abated by morning, and the streets were calm. "The Republican Guard began a deployment around the headquarters of the presidency ... to secure the headquarters of the presidency in its capacity as a symbol of the state and the official headquarters of government," the agency reported. Yet violence had picked up again by Thursday afternoon as the opposing sides began throwing stones at each other, despite the military presence. Angry mobs battled The fighting erupted late on Wednesday afternoon when thousands of Morsi's supporters descended on an area near the presidential palace where about 300 of his opponents were staging a sit-in.

Three dead after setting themselves on fire in Tibet
Tibetan sources say a 17-year-old girl set herself on fire Sunday to protest Chinese rule in ethnic Tibetan areas. Witnesses say Wanchen Kyi shouted slogans in support of the Dalai Lama and a free Tibet as she was engulfed in flames. She died at the scene. More than 3,000 Tibetans and monks later gathered at the site of the self-immolation protest and recited prayers. A day earlier, two young monks also died after setting themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule. The acceleration of self-immolations has coincided with Tibetans staging several anti-China rallies, despite a heavy Chinese security presence. On Sunday, Chinese state media quoted police in Sichuan province as saying a detained Tibetan monk and his nephew had confessed they incited eight people to set themselves on fire in anti-Chinese protests. Image caption Exiled groups deny encouraging self-immolations Chinese authorities have arrested a monk and his nephew for inciting self-immolation protests in Sichuan province, state media says.

"As Massachusetts' senior senator today and as a colleague of Ed Markey's for 28 years, I'm excited to learn of and support his decision to run for the United States Senate," Kerry wrote in a statement, which also noted he will likely soon hold a job which requires he remain "apolitical." Follow @politicalticker The support of Kerry, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee - the official body tasked with electing Democrats to the Senate - and the wife of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy will make it challenging for another candidate to enter the field. Kerry is expected to be confirmed by his Senate colleagues, and Markey told supporters on Thursday that he would run for Kerry's seat in the anticipated special election this spring. He is the first candidate to have announced publicly he will seek the seat, though other Democrats have indicated their interest. The state's outgoing Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who lost his bid for re-election to a full term, may also throw his hat in the ring. Markey said he was "humbled and honored" to have Kerry's support and proud to have Vicki Kennedy on his side. "It is because of Vicki's energy, passion and commitment that Massachusetts and the entire nation are healthier, safer and a place for our children to thrive," he wrote. "I look forward to working with her to promote the health and best interests of the people of Massachusetts." "At a time when the country needs real leadership that looks out for the middle class, Ed Markey always remembers where he came from and will continue the hard work needed to turn our economy around," Bennet wrote. Kerry described Markey as "one of the most experienced and capable legislators in the entire Congress and it would be an almost unprecedented occasion for such an accomplished legislator to join the Senate able to hit the ground running on every issue of importance to Massachusetts." Markey is the longest-serving member of the Massachusetts congressional delegation and the ninth most senior member of the U.S. House.

Israelis re-elect Netanyahu, centre-left rises
Former journalist whose party won second largest share of seats is courted by both Binyamin Netanyahu and Shelly Yachimovich Yair Lapid, the celebrity journalist turned politician who shook the Israeli political landscape with an unexpectedly strong showing in Tuesday's election, was last night being intensively courted by parties on both right and left who are desperate to snare him for their camp. Lapid, whose party came second, winning 19 of 120 parliamentary seats, was the target of competing appeals by Binyamin Netanyahu, who – although weakened – is expected to form another coalition government, and Shelly Yachimovich, who is likely to be leader of the opposition. Lapid's pivotal role followed a poor result for Netanyahu's rightwing alliance, which secured 31 seats, down from a previous total of 42. In a blow to the incumbent prime minister, a sizeable proportion of former supporters are believed to have switched allegiance to Lapid, who entered politics only a year ago. Netanyahu is considering complex options for the next coalition government, the inevitable outcome of Israel's electoral system of proportional representation. He telephoned Lapid shortly after exit polls accurately predicted the result of the election, telling him: "We have the opportunity to do great things together." Further conversations between the pair took place in private, but one of the main issues for negotiation was thought to be an end to the exemption for ultra-Orthodox Jews from compulsory military service. "The Israeli public wants me to continue leading the country and it wants me to build a coalition that would create three major changes domestically: more equal distribution of the national burden [military service], affordable housing, and change in the system of government," he said. During his first term, Netanyahu focused on security issues, with the Iranian nuclear programme at the top of his list of priorities. After congratulating Lapid on his "remarkable achievement", she told reporters: "I urge him not to join a Netanyahu-led government and not take part in the middle-class calamity which will happen the day after he is sworn in.

Snowmobiler Caleb Moore dies from injuries sustained during the Winter X Games XVII
Caleb Moore was a Texas kid drawn to the snow, rehearsing complicated tricks on a snowmobile into a foam pit back home until they became second nature and ready for the mountains. With his younger brother following along and constantly pushing him, Moore became a rising talent in action sports. The innovative freestyle snowmobile rider, who was hurt in a crash at the Winter X Games in Colorado, died Thursday morning. I've watched him try some crazy, crazy tricks and some of them were successful.' —Snowmobile rider Levi LaVallee Moore had been undergoing care at a hospital in Grand Junction since the Jan. 24 crash. Family spokeswoman Chelsea Lawson confirmed his death, the first in the 18-year history of the X Games. A former all-terrain vehicle racer, Moore switched over to snowmobiles as a teenager and quickly rose to the top of the sport. He won four Winter X Games medals, including a bronze last season when his younger brother, Colten, captured gold. Caleb Moore was attempting a backflip in the freestyle event in Aspen last week when the skis on his 450-pound snowmobile caught the lip of the landing area, sending him flying over the handlebars. Moore landed face first into the snow with his snowmobile rolling over him.

The Commons voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, by 400 to 175, a majority of 225, at the end of a full day's debate on the bill. Prime Minister David Cameron has described the move as "an important step forward" that strengthens society. Voting lists show that 136 Conservatives opposed the bill. This figure includes two cabinet ministers - Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and Welsh Secretary David Jones - eight junior ministers, and eight whips. Of the remaining Conservative MPs, 127 were in favour, 35 did not vote, and five registered an abstention by voting both in favour and against. But she described the legislation as "a major step forward for equality and justice". 'We are all equal' Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said: "I genuinely believe that we will look back on today as a landmark for equality in Britain. Marriage is about love and commitment, and it should no longer be denied to people just because they are gay.

Pope Benedict XVI resigns effective February 28
4.24pm GMT Alex Fenton-Thomas profiles the two other candidates that bookies are now predicting might replace Benedict. Cardinal Francis Arinze Converted from traditional animist beliefs at the age of nine, the Igbo Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze has been touted as papabile since before Pope John Paul II and was a leading candidate to be elected in 2005. He made his name during the Nigeria-Biafra war when, as archbishop of Onitsha, he organised the distribution of food and medical supplies to the poor in a region torn apart by the conflict. He was made a cardinal in 1985 and is known for his tolerance of elements of traditional worship in Catholic mass. Cardinal Marc Ouellet Marc Ouellet, a French-Canadian, has also been linked with the papacy in the past, especially since being appointed the head of the Congregation of Bishops, which appoints bishops throughout the world. Born in 1944 in rural Quebec, he was appointed archbishop of Quebec in 2002 and made cardinal a year later. He attracted controversy in 2010 when he addressed an anti-abortion conference in Quebec City, saying that terminating a pregnancy was a "moral crime". “We love him,” said Archbishop Gabriel Charles Palmer-Buckle, metropolitan archbishop of Ghanaian capital Accra, who was made archbishop in Ghana at the same time as Cardinal Turkson and has known him since school. “For Ghanaians he was our first cardinal, and to be made cardinal in his 50s was a big feather in our cap." Turkson’s time in the role has not been without controversy, however.

Scottish Cardinal Keith O'Brien resigns amid sex abuse allegations
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Daniela Relph reports on the cardinal's resignation Britain's most senior Roman Catholic cleric, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, is stepping down as leader of the Scottish Catholic Church. He had been accused of inappropriate behaviour towards priests dating back to the 1980s - claims he contests. Cardinal O'Brien, the Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, apologised to "all whom I have offended" for "any failures" during his ministry. He will not take part in electing a new pope, leaving Britain unrepresented. Analysis The resignation of Britain's most senior Roman Catholic cleric in the wake of allegations of improper behaviour creates a crisis for the Church in Scotland, and represents a heavy blow to the wider Church as it battles to shore up its reputation ahead of the papal election or "conclave". The conclave is already expected to be difficult in the circumstances created by Pope Benedict's unprecedented resignation. The Vatican is also struggling to deal with reports of internal corruption and mismanagement. Cardinal O'Brien's resignation is also a personal tragedy for himself. In resigning his post at the head of the Scottish Catholic Church, Cardinal O'Brien blights the end of an illustrious career only a few weeks before he was due to retire. The cardinal said in a statement: "I have valued the opportunity of serving the people of Scotland and overseas in various ways since becoming a priest. "Looking back over my years of ministry: For any good I have been able to do, I thank God. He remains a cardinal and would be entitled to join the conclave selecting the new Pope after Benedict XVI announced on 11 February that he would resign - but said he would not go.

Liberal Democrats hold onto Eastleigh in by-election as UKIP vote soars
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nick Clegg said the by-election had been fought in "exceptionally difficult circumstances" The Liberal Democrats have won the Eastleigh by-election, with the UK Independence Party pushing the Conservatives into third place. Leader Nick Clegg said the party's candidate Mike Thornton had pulled off a "stunning victory" which had been secured "against the odds". UKIP leader Nigel Farage said its best-ever performance in a Westminster poll showed it had "connected with voters". David Cameron said the Tories would recover from a "disappointing" result. The by-election was called after former Lib Dem cabinet minister Chris Huhne resigned as an MP following an admission he had perverted the course of justice over driving licence points. 'Superb record' But the party, which has held Eastleigh since another by-election in 1994, won despite a fall in its share of the vote of more than 14 percentage points since the 2010 general election.

Al-Qaeda commander Abou Zeid killed in Mali by French forces
Image caption Abou Zeid (l) is said to have been one of the most violent al-Qaeda commanders in the region A senior al-Qaeda militant has been killed in northern Mali, Chadian President Idriss Deby has said. He said the country's forces killed Abdelhamid Abou Zeid during clashes in the remote region. He is said to be second-in-command of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which is fighting foreign forces in Mali. The Algerian national is accused of killing two Western hostages - Briton Edwin Dyer in 2009 and Frenchman Michel Germaneau the following year. BBC West Africa correspondent Thomas Fessy says that, if confirmed, his death will immediately raise questions over the state of several French hostages who are widely believed to have been in Abou Zeid's custody. A US official - speaking on condition of anonymity - said Washington found reports that Abou Zeid was killed "very credible", according to the AFP news agency. However, France reacted with caution to the reports, with government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem stressing that his death was so far unconfirmed. In January France sent some 3,500 troops to northern Mali to oust various Islamist militant groups who had seized a vast area of the Sahara desert. Chad is one of several African countries to have supported the French operation. 'Most violent commander' After recapturing the region's main towns, French and Chadian troops have been battling Islamist fighters in the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains north of Kidal, where the militants had regrouped, in recent weeks.

Chadian army: Mokhtar Belmokhtar 'killed' in Mali

His death was announced on Chadian state television but has not been confirmed by other sources. Mokhtar Belmokhtar is a former al-Qaeda leader said to have ordered January's attack on an Algerian gas plant where at least 37 hostages were killed. Chadian troops are fighting Islamist militants in Mali as part of an international force led by France. The French president's office says a French soldier was killed in northern Mali on Saturday - the third to die since France launched its intervention in Mali on 11 January. 'Final stages' The statement carried by Chadian television on Saturday said: "Chadian forces in Mali completely destroyed the main jihadist base in the Adrar de Ifhogas mountains... killing several terrorists including leader Mokhtar Belmokhtar." Weapons, equipment and 60 vehicles were seized, it added. Analysis For two decades now, Mokhtar Belmokhtar has been one of the most infamous Saharan warlords. The self-proclaimed mastermind behind the recent Algerian gas plant hostage-taking, he and his jihadist followers are reputed to have extorted millions of euros over the years in ransoms from European governments, desperate to free their kidnapped citizens. Last year he fell out with other leading members of al-Qaeda's franchise in the Sahara and formed his own jihadist organisation, calling it the Signed in Blood Brigade. If his death is confirmed it will be a huge blow to his followers, although they will likely vow to avenge him and attempt to replace him as quickly as possible. Abou Zeid - whose death is still to be confirmed by DNA evidence - is said to be second-in-command of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which is fighting foreign forces in Mali.

Frankfurt airport had to cancel more flights on Wednesday, after hundreds of passengers remained stranded overnight. Meanwhile the Eurostar high-speed train has resumed its service between London, Paris and Brussels but with delays. The cross-Channel train had been forced to suspend all travel on Tuesday after a severe snowstorm struck France, Belgium, Germany and the UK. France's SNCF rail company put up more than stranded 1,000 travellers in hotel rooms and sleeping carriages overnight, it said. "For 24 hours, 10,000 employees have been working to remove snow from the rail lines and re-establish service," SNCF said in a statement.

Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires elected as Pope Francis
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor welcomed the election of Pope Francis: "The very name, I think, is indicative of a new style" British politicians and religious leaders have welcomed the election of Jorge Bergoglio, the Archbishop of Buenos Aires, as the new Pope. David Cameron said it was a "momentous day" for Catholics around the world. Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols, the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, said the election was a moment of "excitement". Anglican leader, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, said he looked forward to working with Pope Francis. The 76-year old is the first pontiff to come from Latin America and his election follows the retirement of Pope Benedict XVI last month. 'Inspired choice' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Archbishop Nichols said Pope Francis was clearly a pontiff with a "depth of experience and different aspects" to him. "He's from an Italian family; he's from a working-class background, yet he studied in Germany so he understands European academic life thoroughly. He's a trained chemist and therefore brings together in himself the world of science and religion, which in our eyes is so often opposed. "And all of these things together with years of pastoral service of the poor make a remarkable combination and add to that tinge of excitement that we all feel." He added the Pope would bring a "fresh agenda" to the Catholic Church at the same time as reminding its followers to "base our lives firmly on a relationship with Christ".

Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat up for re-election next year, publicly announced his support Monday for gay marriage in a post on Facebook.

Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher dies aged 87
Image caption Baroness Thatcher was the first woman to be UK prime minister, winning three elections Former Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher has died "peacefully" at the age of 87 after suffering a stroke while staying at the Ritz hotel in central London. David Cameron called her a "great Briton" and the Queen spoke of her sadness at the death. Lady Thatcher was Conservative prime minister from 1979 to 1990. She will not have a state funeral but will be accorded the same status as Princess Diana and the Queen Mother. The ceremony, with full military honours, will take place at London's St Paul's Cathedral. The union jack above Number 10 Downing Street has been lowered to half-mast while Parliament will be recalled from its Easter recess on Wednesday to enable MPs to pay tributes to the former prime minister. Obama tribute After cancelling planned talks in Paris with French President Francois Hollande and returning to the UK, Mr Cameron made a statement outside No 10 in which he described Lady Thatcher as "the patriot prime minister" and said she had "taken a country that was on its knees and made it stand tall again". "Margaret Thatcher loved this country and served it with all she had. For that she has her well-earned place in history - and the enduring respect and gratitude of the British people," he said. In an era in which politicians are all too often greeted with indifference, it is easy to forget that Britain was once led by a woman who inspired passion - both love and loathing. Lady Thatcher, who retired from public speaking in 2002, had suffered poor health for several years.

French Senate vote in support of same-sex marriage
Image caption French Family minister Dominique Bertinotti was one of those who spoke during the debate France's upper house of parliament has voted to legalise gay marriage. The bill - which was approved with only minor amendments - is now certain to become law after a final vote in the lower house, expected in May. There have been several demonstrations in Paris both for and against the bill. Gay rights organisations say homosexuals are being increasingly targeted amid opposition to government plans to give gay couples in France the right to marry and adopt children. Friday's Senate vote, by a show of hands, came after senators had on Wednesday approved the first article of the bill allowing gay couples to marry and adopt, by 179 votes to 157. Justice Minister Christiane Taubira praised the result, saying the Senate had strengthened French society "by granting the simple recognition of full citizenship to homosexual couples". Image caption Activists say there has been a rapid rise in homophobic assaults in recent months On Thursday, some 5,000 people took part in a protest in Paris linking critics of the gay marriage bill to homophobia. The rally came as an image apparently showing the victim of a homophobic attack went viral on social media. Opinion polls suggest that around 55-60% of French people support gay marriage, but only about 50% approve of gay adoption.

Gun background checks a no-go in US Senate
President Obama's campaign to curb gun violence dealt sharp blow after plan to expand checks for gun buyers was denied. The US Senate has rejected a bipartisan plan to expand background checks for gun buyers, dealing a sharp blow to President Barack Obama's campaign to curb gun violence after the Newtown school massacre. Despite emotional pleas from families of victims of the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings and broad public support nationwide, the plan to extend background checks to online and gun-show sales failed on a 54-46 vote on Wednesday, six votes short of the 60-vote hurdle needed to clear the Senate. Speaking from the White House on Wednesday, Obama blamed the blockage of the legislation on a "minority" in the US Senate, marking it as a "shameful day for Washington". "The gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill," he said, adding that the proposal "represented moderation and common sense". US President Barack Obama The amendment negotiated by Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was seen as Obama's best hope to pass meaningful gun-control legislation after the December massacre of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown. Intense negotiations Other measures backed by the president - including a proposal to ban rapid-firing "assault" weapons like the one used in Connecticut and a limit on ammunition magazines - also are expected to fail as the Senate conducts nine consecutive votes on gun-control legislation. The votes are the culmination of weeks of intense negotiations and lobbying over Obama's proposed gun restrictions, and the defeat of the background checks amendment could doom the biggest package of gun legislation Congress has considered in two decades. Opponents of the Manchin-Toomey plan and the restrictions on assault weapons said the proposals were an example of government overreach that would infringe on the constitutional right to bear arms. High public support The Democratic-led Senate also will consider several Republican-sponsored amendments backed by the National Rifle Association gun lobby that would expand gun rights, adding an element of uncertainty to the eventual content of the bill.

Haitian cholera victims threaten United Nations with lawsuit
Lawyers representing Haiti cholera victims give the UN 60 days to respond before filing lawsuit against world body. A group of lawyers representing cholera victims in Haiti has threatened to take legal action against the United Nations. James Bays, Al Jazeera's diplomatic editor, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York on Wednesday said the lawyers representing the victims and their families have "presenting a very clear message". "They say they are giving the UN an ultimatum - they have 60 days in which to admit liability, to pay out compensation, or, the lawyers say, they're going to sue," Bays said. The outbreak has brought devastation to a population already struggling to recover from the 2010 earthquake that killed more than 300,000 people earlier that year. More than 8,000 people died and hundreds of thousands more were infected in the epidemic that followed and continued well into 2012. UN peacekeepers have been accused of sparking the outbreak, although the UN has refused to pay compensation to the families of victims of the cholera outbreak. UNITED NATIONS — A Boston-based human rights group said Wednesday it will sue the United Nations in 60 days if the world body does not agree to compensate Haitian cholera victims, apologize to the Caribbean nation for introducing the disease through its peacekeeping force, and launch a major effort to improve sanitation. Lawyers for the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti said they hoped to be able to settle with the United Nations but are ready to go to court in New York if that fails. The announcement was the group's response to a U.N. letter in February saying it is legally immune and was not responsible for the cholera outbreak that has sickened nearly 500,000 people and killed over 7,750 people since the outbreak began in October 2010. The Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti cites independent studies suggesting that the disease was inadvertently brought to Haiti by a U.N. peacekeeping battalion from Nepal, where cholera is endemic.

White House releases Benghazi emails
The White House bowed to Republican pressure on Wednesday to release emails dealing with the aftermath of last year's killings of four Americans, including the US ambassador, in an attack on a diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya. The emails reveal intense negotiations between the White House, the State Department and the CIA over what the government should say about the attack in public. Republicans have for months been claiming the White House was engaged in a cover-up, downplaying the role of an al-Qaida inspired group in the attack and suggesting instead the attack was mainly the result of a demonstration by a mob against an American-produced anti-Islam film. The White House claims the 100 pages of released emails vindicates its actions and that there was no cover-up. The emails relate to talking points drawn up by the White House, the State Department and the CIA for use by the US ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, and by members of Congress for use in media interviews. One of the original talking points, based on an early memo, says: "We believe, based on currently available information, that the attacks in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by protests at the US embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the US consulate and subsequently the annex." The memo says: "The crowd almost certainly was a mix of individuals from across many sectors of Libyan society. The series of email exchanges reveal that the vital phrase "with ties to al-Qaida" was later excised. In an email from the CIA three days after the attack, it noted the reference to al-Qaida, suggesting it was complicit in the deaths of the four Americans, and a CIA analyst says: "Do we know this?" The Obama administration is fighting to dampen three separate scandals – the IRS, the AP phone calls and Benghazi – and hopes the release of the emails will go some way towards placating its critics. But Republicans are almost certain to keep pushing, pressing on the memos as well as issues not dealt with by the memos, such as why ambassador Chris Stevens had gone to such a dangerous place at a sensitive time – the anniversary of 9/11.

Same-sex marriage passes third reading in House of Commons
Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit also warns that legislation could allow him to marry his son to escape inheritance tax The determination of David Cameron to press ahead with legalising gay marriage opens up the possibility of a lesbian queen giving birth to a future monarch by artificial insemination, Lord Tebbit has warned. In one of his more outspoken interventions, the former Conservative party chairman told the Big Issue magazine that the legislation could also allow him to marry his son to escape inheritance tax. Tebbit's remarks indicate that the marriage (same sex couples) bill will have a bumpy ride when it reaches the House of Lords. Tebbit, who said that ministers have "fucked up" by alienating Tory grassroots, accused Downing Street of forcing through the legislation with little thought. "The government discussed it for 20 minutes on the morning of its announcement," he told the Big Issue. Tebbit also said he had challenged a minister about legalising gay marriage at the same time as ending male primogeniture in the royal succession. "I said to a minister I know: have you thought this through? "When we have a queen who is a lesbian and she marries another lady and then decides she would like to have a child and someone donates sperm and she gives birth to a child, is that child heir to the throne?" Tebbit joked that the change could allow parents to marry their children as a way of avoiding inheritance tax. "It's like one of my colleagues said: we've got to make these same sex marriages available to all.

Silvio Berlusconi convicted of sex with underage prostitute
Image copyright AFP Image caption Both Silvio Berlusconi and Karima El Mahroug deny they had sex Italy's former PM Silvio Berlusconi has been sentenced to seven years in jail and banned from public office for having sex with an underage prostitute, and abuse of power. But Mr Berlusconi remains a free man while he appeals against the ruling. Both the 76-year-old media tycoon and the Moroccan woman concerned, Karima El Mahroug, deny they had sex. "I intend to resist this persecution because I am absolutely innocent," Mr Berlusconi said after the verdict. He is already embroiled in several other court cases. In October 2012 he was given a four-year sentence for tax fraud, which is also under appeal.

Ms El Mahroug was one of a group of women invited to Mr Berlusconi's private residence for so-called "bunga-bunga" party evenings. His many opponents will say that the trial and its outcome have exposed Mr Berlusconi for what he is.

US Supreme Court rules Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional
Story highlights The high court opts not to consider the issues of the appeal Instead, it rules on whether those who brought the suit to the court were entitled to do so State officials had refused to defend Proposition 8 after a California court suspended it Justice Kennedy, in dissent, says the court's majority undercut the initiative process The Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds, ruling Wednesday private parties do not have "standing" to defend California's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. The ruling clears the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume. The 5-4 decision avoids, for now, a sweeping conclusion on whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional "equal protection" right that would apply to all states. At issue was whether the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from defining marriage to exclude same-sex couples, and whether a state can revoke same-sex marriage through referendum, as California did, once it already has been recognized. But a majority of the Supreme Court opted not to rule on those issues. Instead, it ruled on "standing" -- whether those who brought the suit to the court were entitled to do so.

Egyptian military issues ultimatum to Morsi
ET CAIRO Egypt's powerful military warned Monday that the nation's first democratically-elected leader in decades had just 48 hours to answer the demands made by thousands of anti-government protesters calling for his ouster, or it would intervene to force a political transition. The military's ultimatum was, it said, a "last chance." In a statement read on Egyptian state television, Defense Minister Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sissi lamented that conservative Islamist President Mohammed Morsi and the largely younger opposition movement, which has led massive protests calling for early elections, had failed to reach an agreement during the previous week. "If the demands of the people are not met by the expiry of this deadline (by Wednesday), the Armed Forces will announce a road-map for the future, and procedures that the Armed Forces will oversee with the participation of all political and national streams, including the youths, who were and still are the real force that ignited their glorious revolution, and without the exclusion of any party," said the statement. The military's ultimatum, read by an unnamed official over a still photo of al-Sissi, came hours after anti-Morsi protesters stormed the Cairo headquarters of his Muslim Brotherhood party, ransacking and looting it. Reuters reports that a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party denounced the ultimatum, saying "everyone" was opposed to a statement he likened to a "military coup." In the statement, al-Sissi called Sunday's protests -- which drew hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets of Cairo and other major Egyptian cities -- "glorious," and said that through the demonstrations, the Egyptian people had made their message loud and clear, and they deserved a response. At least 16 people were killed and more than 780 injured in the violence Sunday and early Monday, Health Ministry spokesman Yehya Moussa told state television. Egyptians were also bracing for another wave of unrest, as the protest movement issued its own ultimatum on Monday, giving Morsi until Tuesday afternoon to step down, or face a fresh round of national civil disobedience. Since he won the nation's first democratic elections since the Arab Spring ouster of long-time dictator Hosni Mubarak, Morsi has divided the nation along similar lines to the revolution itself -- pitting a largely moderate youth from the cities, against more conservative Egyptians who back the Muslim Brotherhood and President Morsi. His backers were also on the streets in Cairo and other cities on Sunday, though in smaller numbers, and some said they were prepared fight to defend the president.

Sandberg and other execs at the social media giant escaped potential disaster when they switched to a United flight returning from a Korean business trip. Two passengers were reported dead and 181 injured when the Boeing 777 landed short of a runway at about 11:27 a.m. PT. "I was on another flight from Korea at the exact same time,'' she said in an email to USA TODAY's Jon Swartz. "We are ok. My friend on that flight is ok, too." Sandberg, 43, says colleagues Debbie Frost, Charlton Gholson and Kelly Hoffman also switched flights. Sandberg, a billionaire and author of the recently released best seller Lean In, took another flight flight from Seoul to cash in air miles tickets for family members. "Thanks you to everyone who is reaching out - and sorry if we worried anyone,'' she tweeted. Samsung executive David Eun, who was on crashed flight, was among the first to tweet and send photos of the heavily damaged Boeing 777.

George Zimmerman found not guilty in Trayvon Martin case
The NAACP was "outraged" over the not-guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman murder trial and called on the Department of Justice to prosecute Zimmerman for shooting Trayvon Martin. "We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict," NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said in a statement. "We will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice, we will continue to fight for the removal of Stand Your Ground laws in every state, and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed," Jealous said. A civil rights probe had previously been opened by the Department of Justice and a spokeswoman said the department would continue to "evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial." Zimmerman shot and killed Martin in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012. Zimmerman, 29, maintains he shot Martin, 17, in self-defense, while the state argued that Zimmerman "profiled" Martin and concluded he was a criminal. The case took on racial overtones after police declined to charge Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic. In Miami and other south Florida cities, police created places for people to peacefully protest, monitoring social media and urging people to remain calm. "For Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful," Crump said.

Russian government confirms gay protesters to be arrested at Olympics
PM says campaign against new Russian anti-gay laws best served by participation at Sochi 2014 Games The prime minister has ruled out a boycott of the Sochi Winter Olympics, claiming that anti-gay prejudice will be better tackled by participation rather than absence. In response to an intervention from broadcaster Stephen Fry calling for the games to be moved from Russia, David Cameron said he had shared the "deep concern" about the abuse of gay people in Russia. Hundreds of people protested in London on Saturday against the Russian anti-gay law that has attracted international condemnation as the World Athletics Championships kick off in Moscow. At the protest Fry said: "All homophobic regimes say this - they say they do it for the children. They do this to stop children being propogandised at by gay people. "That's not the situation at all. What they have done is unleashed thugs who have done unspeakable things to teenagers, lured them, beaten them, humiliated them, tortured them. But writing on Twitter, the prime minister said he believed Britain could more effectively challenge prejudice by attending, rather than boycotting, the event. Fry urged the prime minister to support protests about Russia hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics over concerns about anti-gay laws passed in the country. The broadcaster, writing in an open letter on his website, compared the situation to the decision to hold the 1936 games in Nazi Germany and said President Vladimir Putin "is making scapegoats of gay people". He said: "An absolute ban on the Russian Winter Olympics of 2014 on Sochi is simply essential.

A detailed examination can only be carried out after the water is pumped out and the boat has come back to the surface." Earlier, officials told the BBC they suspected the accident to be the result of an on-board error, not involving any outside agency.

Iraq: Shootings, bombings kill dozens in Baghdad, Baquba, Qiyara, Madaen
Residents pass by a damaged vehicle a day after a bomb attack in central Baquba, 65 km (40 miles) northeast of Baghdad, August 25, 2013. REUTERS/Mohammed Adnan BAQUBA, Iraq Car bombs, roadside bombs and shootings killed at least 47 people in Iraq on Sunday, police and medical sources said, as tensions intensify between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims across the Middle East. Sunni Muslim insurgents and the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq have significantly increased their attacks this year. More than 1,000 Iraqis were killed in July, the highest monthly death toll since 2008, according to the United Nations. More than two years of civil war in neighboring Syria have aggravated deep-rooted sectarian divisions and shaken Iraq's fragile coalition of Shi'ite, Kurdish and Sunni factions. The renewed violence, eighteen months after the last U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq, has sparked fears of a return to the scale sectarian slaughter in 2006 and 2007. Iraqis have suffered extreme violence for years, but since the start of 2013 the intensity of attacks on civilians has dramatically increased. Bomb attacks have increasingly targeted cafes and other places where families gather, as well as the usual targets of military facilities and checkpoints. The biggest of Sunday's attacks took place in central Baquba, 65 km (40 miles) northeast of Baghdad when a car bomb blew up near a housing complex, killing at least 11 people and wounding 34, police said. Earlier attacks included the killing of five soldiers in Qiyara town, some 290 km (180 miles) north of the Iraqi capital, when suspected militants ambushed two taxis taking soldiers from Baghdad to join their units in Mosul, military sources said. "One of the cars escaped the ambush but the second one could not and the militants shot dead five soldiers and burned their bodies after they killed them," a senior intelligence military officer, who declined to be named, said.

China hit by biggest cyberattack to date
Were you trying to access a .cn Internet address over the weekend? Are you still hitting refresh? Internet users in China were met with sluggish response times early Sunday as the country's domain extension came under a "denial of service" attack. The attack was the largest of its kind ever in China, according to the China Internet Network Information Center, a state agency that manages the .cn country domain. The double-barreled attacks took place at around 2 a.m. Sunday, and then again at 4 a.m. Official state media said the attack targeted websites with the .cn country domain, as well as the popular microblogging site Sina Weibo. Denial of service attacks aren't technically "hacks," since they can be done without breaking into any systems. Typically, DoS attacks overwhelm a website's servers by flooding them with requests. It's unclear whether the attack is related to political events in China, which appears to be in the midst of carrying out a crackdown on Internet dissent.

UN observers in Syria fired upon as report alleges US warplanes readying attack
Defence secretary says resources have been moved into place, but White House says options do not include 'regime change' The United States military has provided Barack Obama with a range of options for launching an attack on Syria and is "ready to go" with an offensive, the US defence secretary has said. There is now a growing belief in Washington that a US strike against Syria, possibly involving cruise missiles or long-range bombers, could take place in the next few days. Chuck Hagel said military officials had presented the US president with "all options for all contingencies" and put resources in place to take action against Syria over its purported use of chemical weapons. "We are prepared, we have moved assets in place to be able to fulfil and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take, if he wishes to take any of the options he's asked for," he told the BBC. "We are ready to go, like that." The White House insisted on Tuesday that Barack Obama had still not made a decision about the use of military action, but stressed that "boots on the ground" was not an option being contemplated. "The options that we are considering are not about regime change," said White House spokesman Jay Carney. He declined to say whether the US Congress would be required to authorise any military strike, or be recalled as has happened in Britain's parliament, but insisted the White House was consulting with leaders in the House and Senate and communicating with the chairmen of relevant congressional committees. He said a US intelligence assessment of the chemical attack in a Damascus suburb would be published "this week". In a sign that Obama believes he has the legal authority, independently of Congress, to launch a strike, Carney said that allowing the chemical weapons attack to go unanswered would be a "threat to the United States". Military transporters have also been spotted at Britain's Akrotiri airbase on Cyprus, less than 100 miles from the Syrian coast. Reports from the region suggest the US is gearing up for a swift military action, possibly as soon as Thursday, in a punitive show of force against President Bashar al-Assad.

Mandela discharged from hospital
Former president's condition described as 'critical and at times unstable' as he returns home to Johannesburg Nelson Mandela has been discharged from hospital but remains in a critical and at times unstable condition, South African officials said on Sunday. The 95-year-old former president spent 12 weeks at the Mediclinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria and will continue to receive intensive care at his home in the Johannesburg suburb of Houghton. Mac Maharaj, a friend of Mandela and spokesman for President Jacob Zuma, said: "Former president Nelson Mandela has this morning, 1 September 2013, been discharged from the Pretoria hospital where he has been receiving treatment. We would like to wish him all the best as he continues his recovery at his Johannesburg home." Using Mandela's clan name, he continued: "Madiba's condition remains critical and is at times unstable. Nevertheless, his team of doctors are convinced that he will receive the same level of intensive care at his Houghton home that he received in Pretoria. "His home has been reconfigured to allow him to receive intensive care there. The healthcare personnel providing care at his home are the very same who provided care to him in hospital. Mandela was admitted to hospital on 8 June when, it later emerged, his military ambulance suffered a breakdown and had to wait on the roadside for backup. Rumours about his condition circulated, news teams were scrambled from around the world and South Africans braced for the worst, with crowds gathering outside the hospital and some saying it was time to "let him go". An unseemly battle between Mandela family members over the final resting place of his late children – and by implication Mandela himself – was fought in court.

Japan suggests dumping Fukushima waste at sea as radiation hits lethal levels
Radiation near a tank holding highly contaminated water at Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has spiked 18-fold, the plant's operator said on Sunday, highlighting the struggle to bring the crisis under control after more than two years. Radiation of 1,800 millisieverts per hour — enough to kill an exposed person in four hours — was detected near the bottom of one storage tank on Saturday, Tokyo Electric Power Co , also known as Tepco, said. Japanese law has set an annual radiation exposure safety threshold of 50 millisieverts for nuclear plant workers during normal hours. Japan's nuclear regulator later raised the severity of the leak from a level 1 "anomaly" to a level 3 "serious incident" on an international scale for radiation releases. The Fukushima Daiichi power plant north of Tokyo was devastated by a tsunami on March 11, 2011, that resulted in fuel-rod meltdowns at three reactors, radioactive contamination of the air, sea and food and the evacuation of 160,000 people. It sparked the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl a quarter of a century earlier. While there were no new leaks found at the tank, a Tepco spokesman said another leak had been detected from a pipe connecting two other tanks nearby. "We have not confirmed fresh leakage from the tank and water levels inside the tank has not changed," the Tepco spokesman said. Instruments used previously had only been capable of measuring radiation up to 100 millisieverts, but the new instruments were able to measure up to 10,000 millisieverts. Radiation of 220 millisieverts was also recorded near an adjacent storage tank, where a reading of 70 had been registered last month.

Senior politicians have rejected the newspaper industry's version of a royal charter setting up a press regulator, the BBC's Newsnight has reported.

UK politicians weigh in as 'Plebgate' affair reopens
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the officers went into a meeting with Mr Mitchell with only “one intention in mind”, which was to bring down his political career. Mr Clegg suggested that the Police Federation representatives deliberately set out to discredit Mr Mitchell following the Plebgate incident, in which he was accused of swearing at officers in Downing Street. He said Mr Mitchell has every right to feel “sore” about his treatment at the hands of the officers. Speaking on LBC radio, Mr Clegg said: “These [Police Federation] representatives went into Andrew Mitchell’s office with what appears to be only one intention in mind, which was to go out and tell the world’s press he needed to resign. “They came straight out of that meeting and claimed that he hadn’t provided them with his side of the story. “The subsequent revelation that the meeting had been recorded shows that he made every attempt to describe what happened.” Mr Clegg added: “I think it’s perfectly legitimate for Andrew Mitchell to feel pretty sore about that.” Mr Mitchell was accused of calling officers in Downing Street “----ing plebs” when they refused to open the main gate to allow him to cycle through. At the meeting, held in the Midlands on Oct 12, Mr Mitchell apologised to the federation representatives but again denied using the word “plebs”. In a transcript of the meeting, taken from a recording made by Mr Mitchell, he set out his version of events. He told the meeting: “I give you my word I did not call an officer a ----ing pleb.” He added: “I did say under my breath, but audibly, in frustration, 'I thought you lot were supposed to ----ing help us.’” After the meeting the officers claimed the chief whip had refused to elaborate on what he had said and therefore had no option but to resign. Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, yesterday said: “We’ve got everything we need, we are working on it and I hope we will come to a decision as soon as we can.”

Illinois to allow same-sex marriage law
Under the bill, which House approved 61-54 before sending it to the Senate, gay weddings could be held in Illinois as of June Historic votes Tuesday in the Illinois Legislature positioned that state to become the largest in the heartland to legalize gay marriage, following months of arduous lobbying efforts by both sides in President Barack Obama's home state. Under the measure, which the state House approved 61-54 before sending it on to the Senate for technical changes, gay weddings could be held in Illinois starting in June. The bill heads next to Governor Pat Quinn, who has pledged to sign it but didn't immediately indicate when. The road to the Illinois vote was long with stalled attempts earlier this year, something that frustrated activists in the state where Democrats lead the House, Senate and governor's office. Chicago Democratic Representative Greg Harris, who is the sponsor of the bill, decided not to bring the bill for a vote in May because he said he simply didn't have the support. Then the US Supreme Court ruled to strike down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, something he said resonated with lawmakers. Backers also launched a furious campaign, hiring a lobbyist from the state's largest union, the former head of the Illinois Republican Party and field organizers spanning the state. "To treat all our citizens equally in the eyes of the law we must change this," Harris said on the floor. "Families have been kept apart." Supporters' speeches echoed themes of equality and civil rights with mentions of Obama, Martin Luther King Jr and Matthew Shepard, a gay college student whose 1998 death sparked numerous hate crime bills. Polls show support for gay marriage has surged since 1996, when Gallup found that 27% of Americans backed it.

Iran agrees to expanded monitoring of nuclear sites
LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Monday that there would be pressure to intensify sanctions on Iran if it could not reach a deal with world powers over its disputed nuclear program. "It's very important for the Iranian authorities to understand that the pressure will be there for greater sanctions, for an intensification of sanctions, unless an agreement is reached on these matters," Hague told parliament. UN nuclear chief makes deal in Tehran for wider monitoring of nuclear sites that could boost broader negotiations. Iran's state television says an agreement for expanded monitoring has been reached in talks with the UN nuclear chief in a deal that could boost wider negotiations over Tehran's atomic programme. It is a so-called "roadmap'' that will give UN inspectors a broader reach, including access to a heavy water reactor under construction and a key uranium mine. "The practical measures will be implemented in the next three months, starting from today," Aman said in a news conference in Tehran, broadcast on state television. Amano's visit comes after efforts in Geneva over the weekend stalled on ways to ease Western concerns that Iran could one day produce nuclear weapons. Clearing the obstacles could be a major step towards a deal between Iran and world powers when negotiations resume next week. French 'hopeful' The French foreign minister said on Monday he was hopeful a deal could be reached with Iran over its nuclear programme, although Tehran still had to make an effort on a few points.

Traumatised trio rescued from 'ordinary house on ordinary street' as police say human trafficking case is worst ever found in UK Three women have walked to freedom from a south London house where they were held for 30 years in what police described as the worst case of modern-day slavery ever uncovered in Britain. Police said on Thursday the youngest woman, a 30-year-old British citizen, had had "no contact with the outside world" and was probably born in captivity, possibly within the house in Lambeth. All three women – a 69-year-old from Malaysia, a 57-year-old from Ireland and the British woman – were described as "deeply traumatised", and were being looked after by specialists. The extraordinary story of how the women were rescued from three decades of fear and enslavement within an "ordinary house in an ordinary street" in south London emerged on Thursday after the Metropolitan police's human trafficking unit arrested an unnamed man and woman, both 67, at the same property in Lambeth, at 7.30am. The pair, who are not British citizens, were bailed early on Friday morning until a date in January. The arrest was the final act in a highly sensitive, secretive investigation aimed first at rescuing the women and then getting evidence to detain the suspects. It began when the Irish woman made an audacious telephone call for help last month. Aneeta Prem, the founder of the organisation, said it was a news interview she carried out after a documentary that led to the call for help. That is exactly what they wanted, they wanted freedom," she said. Tense negotiations took place over a week during secret telephone calls that the women were able to make from the house, before – in a carefully choreographed rescue – the three women were able to walk out of the property on 25 October, where officers were waiting.

"We've lost one of the most influential, courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth," he said. "Through his fierce dignity and unbending will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, Madiba transformed South Africa and moved all of us. His journey from a prisoner to a president embodied the promise that human beings and countries can change for the better." Russian President Vladimir Putin said: "Mandela, having gone through the most difficult ordeals, was committed to the end of his days to the ideals of humanism and justice." Chinese President Xi Jinping said the Chinese people would always remember Mr Mandela's "outstanding contributions to the China-South Africa relationship and the course of progress of mankind".

Mary Barra appointed as General Motors chief
• Head of product development Barra, 51, joined GM at 18 • 'I’m honored to lead the best team in the business' General Motors, America’s largest car manufacturer, has named Mary Barra its chief executive, making her the first woman to head a major auto firm. Barra’s appointment was announced Tuesday, a day after the US government sold off its last stake in the auto giant. The daughter of a GM worker, Barra joined the company at 18 and is currently its global head of product development. Michelle Krebs, a veteran auto analyst at Edmunds.com, said the move was a major victory for women in the auto industry. “My first comment to colleagues was: ‘Holy shit!’ I honestly didn’t think this would happen in my lifetime.” The company said the 51-year-old Barra had risen through a series of manufacturing, engineering, and senior staff positions in her 33 years with GM. She succeeds Dan Akerson, a corporate turnaround expert appointed by the Obama administration in 2009 to help shepherd the automaker through its bankruptcy. She will also join the company’s board, the fifth female member of the 14-strong board. On Monday, the Treasury announced it had sold its final stake in the company. GM emerged from bankruptcy in July 2009. The US lost $10.5bn on its GM bailout, officials said, arguing that it was a smaller loss than it would have suffered had GM gone under. The company said Akerson, 65, had brought forward his succession plan several months after his wife was recently diagnosed with an advanced stage of cancer. “I will leave with great satisfaction in what we have accomplished, great optimism over what is ahead and great pride that we are restoring General Motors as America’s standard bearer in the global auto industry,” Akerson said in a message to employees.

Toronto Star reporter pursues legal action against Toronto Mayor
As my libel notice says , I’m asking Ford to immediately retract the false insinuation that I am a pedophile and all of his false statements about my conduct on May 2, 2012. I’m also asking Ford and Vision owner ZoomerMedia to apologize immediately “publicly, abjectly, unreservedly and completely.” No matter how much stress a legal battle might add to my personal and professional life, it is, simply, now necessary. It had become clear to me that, if I had done nothing, the mayor would make his smears some sort of political talking point. His comments to Black were no one-time slip; they seemed to be the first shots in a bewildering campaign against my good name. At a Tuesday news conference, he pointedly said he stands by “every word.” Today, he repeated many of his false claims on American radio. On Thursday I served Rob Ford with a libel notice , the first step in the process of pursuing a defamation lawsuit. I also served Vision TV, which twice broadcast Ford’s vile and defamatory remarks to Conrad Black even though their interview was filmed days before it aired. The mayor very much deserved to be sued, I knew, but I thought I could do more good for the city by challenging him at city hall on policy than challenging him about me in a courtroom. In fact, I so strongly did not want to do this that I had a whole announcement written about why I was going to take the high road and give Ford a pass for his defamation against me. If Ford does not do so, we’ll see if he is willing to repeat his lies under penalty of perjury.

Toronto Mayor responds to libel notice from Toronto Star reporter
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has apologized to Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale over remarks suggesting he was a pedophile and that the reporter was spying on his children. But Dale is not satisfied, and will be pursuing the libel lawsuit. “I never called Mr. Dale a pedophile, I have never used that word to describe Mr. Dale, I do not believe Mr. Dale is a pedophile nor did I intend to suggest that in my comments," Ford's apology began in council chambers on Tuesday. "To be clear, I never personally saw Mr. Dale peering over the fence or taking pictures," Ford went on, saying he wished to sincerely apologize to Dale. Dale, though, said the mayor's apology is not sufficient. "His statement today didn't come close. I'm proceeding with a defamation lawsuit," said Dale on Twitter. I asked for an 'I apologize because I said false, damaging, and unfounded things, and here they are.' And, crucially, he didn't retract or specifically apologize for the categorically false, malicious, and in-itself-defamatory claim about me taking pictures of his young kids." In the interview, Ford said: "Daniel Dale is in my backyard taking pictures.

Alan Turing given posthumous pardon

It addresses his 1952 conviction for gross indecency following which he was chemically castrated. He had been arrested after having an affair with a 19-year-old Manchester man. The conviction meant he lost his security clearance and had to stop the code-cracking work that had proved vital to the Allies in World War Two. 'Appalling' treatment "Dr Alan Turing was an exceptional man with a brilliant mind," said Mr Grayling. He said the research Turing carried out during the war at Bletchley Park undoubtedly shortened the conflict and saved thousands of lives.

The events were held to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth Celebrating Turing Turing's work helped accelerate Allied efforts to read German Naval messages enciphered with the Enigma machine. He also contributed some more fundamental work on codebreaking that was only released to public scrutiny in April 2012. "His later life was overshadowed by his conviction for homosexual activity, a sentence we would now consider unjust and discriminatory and which has now been repealed," said Mr Grayling.

Nauru raises media visa application fee from AU$200 to $8,000
Hazara refugee fears for brothers' lives after family reunion applications pushed to back of queue Updated A Hazara refugee says he fears for the lives of his young brothers in Pakistan after hearing it could be 10 years before they can join him in Australia. Zaman Nasiry, 22, was born in Afghanistan, but moved to Pakistan with his family when he was young. After his father was killed by the Taliban, Mr Nasiry came to Australia by boat in 2011 and has since been granted a permanent visa. Ten months ago his wife and mother were both killed in a market bombing by the Taliban in Quetta, Pakistan. Now, his three younger brothers - aged 13, 11 and 9 - are alone in Pakistan. "In Pakistan the people kill Hazara," Mr Nasiry said. His fears come as the Federal Government moves to make it harder for refugees who arrived by boat and are now living in Australia to be reunited with their families. Mr Morrison says anyone who arrives by boat will go to the back of the queue when applying for family reunion visas. The changes are backdated, which means they will affect people already living in Australia from as far back as 2001. Mr Nasiry had already applied for an orphan-relative visa to bring his three brothers to Australia and had expected the application to take up to a year to be processed. "When I was told the Government changed everything, I don't know what I can do now," Mr Nasiry said.

He was a giant of Israel's military and political scene, but courted controversy throughout his long career. The head of the Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv said Mr Sharon had died on Saturday afternoon of heart failure. President Shimon Peres said he had built Israel but a senior Palestinian said his path was war and aggression. At the hospital Journalists have been camped out at this hospital in central Israel since the start of the month when doctors indicated that the health of the former prime minister had deteriorated. His family - including his two sons, Gilad and Omri - has been here at his bedside and police tried to keep photographers away from them. After regular news updates in which we were told the 85-year-old was "fighting like a lion", the hospital spokesman called an unexpected briefing at lunch-time on Shabbat - the Jewish Sabbath - when much of the country is closed down. He announced that Mr Sharon had "departed peacefully". The former leader was cared for here for most of the past eight years - during which time he was considered to be in a state of minimal consciousness. World reaction to Sharon's death In quotes: Ariel Sharon Ariel Sharon's mark on history Life in pictures Mr Peres, who joined a unity government with Mr Sharon in 2001, said he was "an exceptional man and an exceptional commander who moved his people and loved them and the people loved him". Palestinian political figure Mustafa Barghouti said while no-one should gloat at his death, Mr Sharon had taken "a path of war and aggression" and had left "no good memories with Palestinians".

Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki (L) shakes hands with Tunisia's Prime Minister-designate Mehdi Jomaa after Jomaa spoke during a news conference in Tunis January 26, 2014. REUTERS/Zoubeir Souissi TUNIS Tunisia's national assembly approved the country's new constitution on Sunday in one of the last steps to establishing full democracy three years after the uprising that toppled autocrat Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. Just before the constitution vote, Prime Minister Mehdi Jomaa appointed a caretaker cabinet as part of a deal to end a crisis between Tunisia's Islamist party and its secular opposition until new elections this year. Tunisia's new constitution and progress contrasts sharply with messy transitions in Libya, Egypt and Yemen which are still caught up in turmoil after ousting their own long-standing leaders in 2011 revolts and uprisings. After the historic vote, the red and white Tunisian flag was unfurled and assembly deputies embraced, danced and sang inside the chamber in Tunis to celebrate the charter, which has been widely praised for its inclusiveness. "This constitution was the dream of Tunisians, this constitution is proof of the revival of the revolution, this constitution creates a democratic civil nation," Assembly chief Mustapha Ben Jaafar said. While the new constitution recognizes Islam as the country's religion, it also enshrines freedom of conscience and belief, and equality between the sexes.

France issues pollution alert as ship splits off Basque coast
Twelve people have had to be rescued from a Spanish cargo ship after it collided with a breakwater off the French coast. The 100m vessel, named "The Luno", crashed into a breakwater on the coast of Anglet after its engine failed, causing the ship to split in two as it collided. The ship, believed to be carrying fertiliser, had initially been heading to a nearby port to load up cargo before the crash occurred. Attempts to rescue crew members on board proved to be difficult after recent storms affecting the South west coast of France had made the conditions tough. However, a lifeguard on board managed to help crew members to safety before being airlifted away by helicopter. It has been reported that none of the crew members were seriously hurt, although one person was treated after suffering a nose injury. An eyewitness told BBC News that he thought the rescue operation was "brave considering the state of the sea". He said: "When I arrived the vessel was anchored facing the sea wall. Local authorities have raised a pollution warning after fuel from the ship contaminated water near the shore.

Two dead in storms with no sign of floods letting up in Britain
Male passenger of cruise ship dies after massive wave hits craft and woman killed after part of London building collapses on car Two people died in separate incidents on Friday as storms continued to batter the UK. One woman was killed and a man was taken to hospital after the front of a building in central London collapsed on their car, police said. And, in the Channel, an 85-year-old man died after being airlifted from a cruise ship that was hit by a massive wave. Several other passengers were also injured in the incident, including a woman in her 70s. The man injured in London was said to be in a stable condition following the incident, which happened close to Holborn tube station just after 11pm on Friday. Police released a photograph of the damaged vehicle and asked people to stay away from the area in the early hours of Saturday. London has followed the south-west of England and the Thames Valley – as well as other parts of Britain – in experiencing storms, with heavy winds in the capital on Friday night and in the early hours of Saturday. Cruise & Maritime Voyages (CMV), which operates the liner, said on Friday: "CMV regrets to advise that earlier today their cruise ship, MS Marco Polo, en route to her home port of Tilbury from the Azores, was hit by a freak wave during adverse sea conditions in the south-western approaches of the Channel. "The vessel sailed from Tilbury on 5 January and is carrying 735 mainly British passengers and 349 crew. "Our thoughts are very much with these passengers and their families during this difficult time." With two inches of rain expected in the South West, it may be another week before the knock-on effects are felt downstream in major rivers, while overflowing groundwater levels will mean the water may not drain away until the spring.

Thai school bus crash kills fifteen
Thirteen students and two teachers killed after bus crashes into truck in eastern part of the country. At least 15 people, including 13 students and two teachers, have been killed after the bus they were travelling in crashed into a truck in eastern Thailand. Police Lieutenant Colonel Anukarn Thammavijarn said the bus lost control on Friday morning on a downhill road and slammed into the truck, which was in front of it. The bus was carrying students, aged 10 to 15, from their school in northeastern Nakhon Ratchasima city to the beachside town of Pattaya. Police are searching for the bus driver who fled and are investigating if the crash was caused by a problem with the brakes. Local media showed pictures of a row of bodies covered by sheets laid out by the side of the wreckage of the bus, whose top deck was crushed on one side. A recent report by the World Health Organisation said the country saw some 38.1 road deaths per 100,000 people, behind only the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean and the South Pacific island of Niue. That compares with an average of 18.5 in Southeast Asia as a whole.

Canada has no plans to boycott Winter Paralympics
David Cameron has instructed his ministers to stay away from the Sochi Paralympics because of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, while several national Paralympic associations are discussing whether their athletes should still take part. After an announcement by the foreign secretary, William Hague, that the UK was withdrawing from preparatory talks before the G8 summit in Sochi, scheduled for June, Cameron tweeted: "Because of the serious situation in Ukraine, William JHague & I believe it would be wrong for UK ministers to attend the Sochi Paralympics." Following Cameron's announcement Buckingham Palace said Prince Edward had pulled out of the Paralympics on the advice of the government after Russia's decision to take military action in Ukraine. The prince is patron of the British Paralympic Association and was due to attend the Sochi Games for three days next week. Russia, meanwhile, got in a little retaliation against the west when its main television channel announced it would no longer show the Oscar ceremony. It said in a statement: "Due to the large amount of news concerning the situation in Crimea and the Ukraine and the audience's rising interest in news programmes, Channel One considers it impossible to air the Oscars ceremony for five hours, particularly in the morning." None of the 44 countries taking part in the 11th Winter Paralympics, which open on Friday, have yet hinted at withdrawal, but a number are monitoring the situation. The Russian venue, which has just finished hosting the Olympics, is less than 300 miles from Simferopol, Crimea's administrative capital, although there are no immediate security fears for the 700 participating athletes. However, should the situation escalate significantly in the next few days some Paralympic associations could come under political pressure to reconsider. A spokeswoman said: "We are clearly monitoring the events in Ukraine and continue to be in close contact with the Foreign Office, who are leading on security matters." A spokeswoman for the US Olympic Committee, which deals with Paralympic matters, said: "Nothing has changed in our planning. In a statement on Saturday the International Paralympic Committee said it hoped to see Russia adhere to the Olympic truce, a tradition backed by a UN resolution that asks nations to cease hostilities during the Olympics and Paralympics. It said: "We want the story here to be the great festival of sport that has already taken place in Sochi and will continue now that athletes are arriving for the start of the Winter Paralympics."

Opening race of 2014 F1 season brings 'fascination'
Daniel Ricciardo's fate may not be known for weeks, says Australian Grand Prix chief Andrew Westacott Updated Australian Grand Prix chief executive Andrew Westacott says Red Bull's appeal against Daniel Ricciardo's disqualification could take weeks to conclude. Ricciardo finished second in yesterday's race - the best result for a local driver in an Australian F1 Grand Prix. But world motorsport's governing body, the FIA (International Federation of Automobiles), later quashed the result, ruling the team breached fuel-flow rules. The regulations, which only allow a fuel flow of 100 kilograms per hour, were only introduced this year and mark a drastic reduction from last year's averages of approximately 170kg/h. On top of that, Westacott says the equipment used to disqualify Daniel Ricciardo from the race had not been functioning properly for most of the weekend. "These sensors were faulty on Friday, the FIA and Red Bull says 'It's not working, put in a new one for Saturday'," he said. "They put in a new one for Saturday, that didn't work, they went back to the one on Friday." "Red Bull knows their technical qualifications and the details associated with the fuel injectors in their engines. The team's statement informing of their intention to appeal suggested they did not trust the readings given by the FIA's instruments. "Inconsistencies with the FIA fuel flow meter have been prevalent all weekend up and down the pit lane," they said. "The team and Renault are confident the fuel supplied to the engine is in full compliance with the regulations." Team boss says Ricciardo not to blame Red Bull boss Christian Horner said Ricciardo was blameless in the whole ordeal as he vowed to continue the team's fight against the ruling.

Kansas anti-gay church leader Fred Phelps dies at 84
Image copyright AP Image caption Phelps was an ordained Baptist minister, although his church was not affiliated with any mainstream denomination The former leader of a US church that was widely known for its inflammatory anti-gay protests has died, his family has said. The Reverend Fred Phelps Sr, founder of the Westboro Baptist Church in Kansas, died on Wednesday evening at 84. The church, made up mostly of his family, rose to international notoriety with its practice of picketing funerals of fallen US troops. It claimed their deaths were punishment for America's tolerance of gay people. 'Diabolical' Their signs read "Thank God for dead soldiers" and "Thank God for 9/11" and the like, and bore messages offensive to gay and lesbian people. Mr Phelps earned a law degree from Washburn University in 1964, but was stripped of his licence to practise in Kansas in 1979. The Kansas Supreme Court said Mr Phelps made false statements in documents and "showed little regard" for professional ethics. Later, he and his small congregation - founded in 1955 and later dubbed "the most hated family in America" by the BBC's Louis Theroux - aimed their vitriol at many groups, including immigrants and Jews. "You're not going to get nowhere with that slop that 'God loves you,'" Mr Phelps once told the Religion News Service. "That's a diabolical lie from hell without biblical warrant."

Afghans go to the polls
Kabul, Afghanistan - Millions of Afghans have cast their ballots to pick the country's next president, with only isolated attacks on polling stations reported in the country's first democratic transfer of power in its 5,000 year history. After months of manoeuvring, jockeying, tribal meetings and campaigning, Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, Abdullah Abdullah and Zalmai Rassoul have emerged as the frontrunners in Saturday's polls, coming from a field of eight candidates that includes everyone from former mujahedeen commanders to Western-educated technocrats. Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Kabul, described turnout in the polls as high, despite threats of violence and weather disturbance in some parts of the country. Voting has also been extended for at least an hour, with the possibility of another extension depending on the volume of voters, he said. Afghanistan has never had an election so well prepared so well in advance. Nicholas Haysom, deputy head of the UN mission in Afghanistan Four voters were wounded in an explosion at a polling station in the southeastern province of Logar. Voting was also reportedly disrupted in seven polling stations in Khost province, where two people were reportedly injured, according to Al Jazeera's D. Parvaz, who is reporting from Kabul. As of Saturday afternoon, the election commission has received 200 complaints of poll fraud. In an interview with Al Jazeera, political analyst Haroun Mir said that Afghan citizens know that the 2014 national and local elections are critical to the country's future, which continues to be threatened by the Taliban. The group has recently carried out several attacks in the capital Kabul and across the country that left many dead and created an atmosphere of insecurity.

UK culture minister Maria Miller called to resign following alleged threat to Telegraph newspaper
Pressure on the culture secretary, Maria Miller, has been ramped up by a poll suggesting a large majority of voters think she should be dropped from the cabinet, stripped of her responsibility for press regulation and thrown out of the House of Commons over her expenses. A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday found that almost three-quarters of voters (73%) thought her 32-second apology to the House of Commons on Thursday was inadequate, and similar numbers (75%) felt David Cameron was wrong to offer her his support. Some 78% of those questioned said she should forfeit her cabinet post as culture secretary, 66% said she should lose powers over press regulation and 68% said she should be "sacked" as an MP – something that is not currently possible, as the government has yet to introduce the power of recall promised in the 2010 coalition agreement. Meanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph quoted an unnamed "senior minister", speaking on condition of anonymity, as saying: "In my view she has clearly behaved in a way that is incompatible with what she should be doing as a cabinet minister. The decision to keep her on undermines the prime minister because he has talked about a new kind of politics." Miller's apology came after a cross-party panel of MPs overruled parliament's standards commissioner, Kathryn Hudson, who recommended after an inquiry that the culture secretary should repay £45,000 in expenses for a house she shared with her parents. The Commons standards committee instead decided she needed to hand back just £5,800 and say sorry for failing to co-operate fully with the inquiry. The watchdog in charge of MPs' expenses said it was time for the House of Commons to give up the power to police itself over standards and ethics, warning: "MPs marking their own homework always ends in scandal." Sir Ian Kennedy, chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), told the Sunday Times: "We have made great progress in cleaning up the problems of the past. To avoid further damage to parliament in the future, it should have the confidence to give away powers in regulating itself and see that independent regulation is the best, most transparent way forward.

Crucifix in Northern Italy collapses, crushing man to death
Just two days before the canonization of Pope John Paul II, a giant crucifix erected in his honor collapsed in Italy, crushing a young man and killing him, according to ANSA.

The Jesus Christ figure attached to the cross is six meters high and weighs 600 kg, according to AFP.

Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman to quit
Image caption Paxman's first job at the BBC was in radio but it is as a Newsnight presenter that he will be remembered Jeremy Paxman is quitting BBC Two's Newsnight after 25 years at the helm. The BBC said he made his decision last summer but "generously agreed" to stay until June to help the show through "a difficult period". That came after it chose not to run an item linking Jimmy Savile with child abuse. Paxman said it was "time to move on" and he "should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people". Director General Tony Hall said Paxman, 63, was "a rare and dazzling talent". 'Cussed brilliance' "He has a unique ability to create moments of real discomfort for politicians and memorable delight for audiences," Mr Hall said. "For that cussed brilliance and much more besides, the BBC and our audiences will always be in his debt." Image caption And David Cameron in April 2010 The BBC's head of news, James Harding, said Paxman had become the "great lion of BBC journalism" who "never failed to ask the difficult questions". Associate editor of the Daily Mirror Kevin Maguire tweeted: "Jeremy Paxman quitting Newsnight is like the ravens flying the Tower of London or the Barbary apes leaving Gibraltar." And the Daily Telegraph's Dan Hodges wrote that the "great lion sleeps tonight", adding that "the place people now go at 10.30pm to get their current affairs fix isn't the TV, but Twitter".

BJP's Narendra Modi elected new prime minister of India
Image copyright AP India's Prime Minister-elect, Narendra Modi, has been performing religious rituals in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi after his election landslide. Mr Modi offered prayers on the banks of the river Ganges after being greeted by jubilant supporters. Mr Modi, 63, also promised to clean up the Ganges, considered a sacred river by Hindus. He was elected to parliament from Varanasi as well as from another seat in his home state of Gujarat. Analysis Narendra Modi arrived to a hero's welcome in the Indian capital for the first time after leading his party to a historic win. Supporters lined the streets, showering him with flowers en route to BJP headquarters. A brass band kept pace with a company of bagpipers and supporters danced and sang. "He's coming, he'll be here very soon," one of them told exuberant supporters, while another begged people to get down from trees they had climbed to gain a vantage point. As they spotted the cavalcade, Mr Modi's supporters at party HQ drove themselves into a frenzy, almost knocking down the security barricades in the process.

Bank of England governor warns housing market is biggest threat to UK economy
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Bank of England chief Mark Carney says the housing market has the potential to wreck the recovery The governor of the Bank of England has given his strongest warning yet about the dangers to Britain's economy posed by the booming housing market. Mark Carney said the market represented the "biggest risk" to financial stability and the long-term recovery. He added there were deep structural problems which needed to be addressed. He told Sky News the fundamental problem was a shortage of homes - and the Bank of England had no solution to that. In an interview on the Murnaghan show, he said the Bank was "closely watching" rising property prices and the subsequent increase in large-value mortgages, which he warned could lead to a "debt overhang" which could destabilise the economy. 'Making progress' There are not sufficient houses built in the UK Mark Carney Profile: Mark Carney Mr Carney said: "When we look at domestic risk, the biggest risk to financial stability and therefore to the durability of the expansion [of the economy]; those risks centre in the housing market." He added: "There are not sufficient houses built in the UK. To go back to Canada, there are half as many people in Canada as in the UK, twice as many houses are built every year in Canada as in the UK and we can't influence that." Official government figures show the country began work on 133,650 homes in the year to March, a rise of 31% on the year before. A former government advisory body has said the UK needs to build almost 300,000 homes a year until 2031 to meet current demand. Prime Minister David Cameron, who was also interviewed by Murnaghan, admitted the government needed to build more houses and said Mr Carney was "absolutely right". He said: "The building of houses is going up. If you talk to any housing developer at the moment, or builder, they will tell you that the Help to Buy scheme... has been hugely helpful in bringing forward more development or house building." He told the BBC's Andrew Marr: "The big long-term problem is that we simply do not build enough homes in this country."

'Hunger Games' salute used to protest coup d'état in Thailand
As if it weren't enough that a military coup in Thailand has imposed martial law and curfews, took over the radio and television stations and has been arresting partisans of the old regime. Now citizens can be arrested for flashing the three-fingered salute from the Hunger Games movies. A spokesman for the military junta, Col. Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak, told the Associated Press "We know it comes from the movie, and let’s say it represents resistance against the authorities." An individual making the salute would likely have no problem, he said, "but if it is a political gathering of five people or more, then we will have to take some action," including arrest. Military coups have a long history Thailand - there have been 14 of them, plus some half-dozen attempted coups, since the nation abandoned absolute monarchy in 1932. "Each year, Thailand tends to experience at least one period of frenzied coup speculation," wrote Thailand scholar Nicholas Farrelly in the Australian Journal of International Affairs last year. "Coups clearly still play a major role in Thai mainstream politics." This coup, though, is generally seen as more severe than most. Begun on May 22, it is notable for the roundup of politicians, academics and "red shirt" supporters of former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, ousted by the courts on May 7, and her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thai newspapers have reported that curfews were lifted yesterday in major tourist areas such as beach resorts.

Queen's Speech sets out Coalition government's final year agenda
Deputy PM Nick Clegg says he agrees with Zac Goldsmith and other critics of his government's proposals to give people limited powers to kick out MPs. Mr Goldsmith, a Tory MP, said voters were being "duped" by the Recall Bill which proposed a Commons committee having power over the whole process. Mr Clegg said he had settled for a "modest" version because of "Conservative Party resistance". Mr Goldsmith accused Mr Clegg of "desperate backtracking". The Richmond Park MP said he wished it was true that the deputy PM was "at one" with him "but it is the opposite of the truth... Nick Clegg is the architect of the current Recall Bill". The bill was unveiled in the Queen's Speech after years of delays and wrangling between coalition ministers. The measure was promised in the coalition agreement between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems in 2010. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zac Goldsmith: "It's worse than meaningless, it's a pretence" Under the Recall of MPs Bill, constituents would be able to sack their MP if they are sentenced to up to 12 months in jail. MPs are already removed if they are jailed for more than a year. Voters could also trigger a by-election if the House of Commons resolves that an MP has engaged in "serious wrongdoing". A by-election would be forced if more than 10% of constituents signed a petition over an eight-week period after the Commons ruled an MP could face recall. The government said the move would give constituents a direct voice when MPs have behaved badly - but Mr Goldsmith said the final say would still rest with a committee of MPs, meaning it would not be true recall as it is understood in other countries, where any politician can be recalled if a certain proportion of their constituents sign a petition. Then most famous case of recall being used was in California in 2003, when more than the necessary 12% of voters signed a petition to cause a recall vote that led to Gray Davis being replaced by actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Conservatives win Newark by-election
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Conservative Robert Jenrick said he fought his campaign on local issues The Conservatives have won the Newark by-election, retaining the seat with a majority of more than 7,000. Candidate Robert Jenrick polled 17,431 votes, beating UKIP's Roger Helmer, who finished second with 10,028 votes. Labour's Michael Payne came third with 6,842 votes but it was a disastrous result for the Lib Dems, who were beaten into sixth place. Chancellor George Osborne said the victory was a "strong endorsement" of the Conservatives' economic plan. The resignation of Newark's former Conservative MP Patrick Mercer, who quit over a cash-for-questions scandal, had raised expectations in UKIP - on a high from their recent European election victory - that they could cause a major upset by winning their first seat at Westminster. But the Conservatives flooded the seat with MPs and activists in the run-up to polling day - with David Cameron visiting the Nottinghamshire market town four times - in their bid to retain what was, in theory, a safe seat. In the end, Mr Cameron's party won a relatively comfortable victory, although UKIP succeeded in more than halving the party's 16,000 majority that it gained at the 2010 General Election and increasing their share of the vote by 22.1%. In finishing third, Labour polled 17.68% of the vote, down 4.65% from the general election. Analysis Image copyright Getty Images BBC Political correspondent Alex Forsyth writes: After UKIP's success in the European elections, some feared the political earthquake the party had promised. The party failed to get its first MP elected to Westminster, but it did leave a dent in the Conservative majority, although not as much as Mr Farage had hoped - or predicted. David Cameron will use this by-election victory to say UKIP's bubble has burst and he has stopped the "people's army" in its tracks - but it took an army of his own to do it. David Cameron said it was a "very good" result for for the Conservatives but acknowledged the Tories needed to "work between now and the next election" to win back voters from UKIP.

Unite union tell UK Labour to offer EU referendum
Shadow chancellor rejects suggestion by Unite leader that party risks losing votes by not giving people a say on Europe Shadow chancellor Ed Balls last night said he disagreed with Unite's call for a referendum promise in the Labour manifesto, accusing the head of the country's biggest trade union of supporting a Tory policy that would be bad for jobs. The shadow chancellor dismissed a warning from Unite general secretary Len McCluskey that the party risked being "boxed in" at the 2015 general election unless it dropped its opposition to matching David Cameron's promise to allow voters a say. Delegates at the conference of Labour's biggest union affiliate approved a statement from Unite's executive urging Labour to "urgently reconsider" its approach to a referendum, and making it clear that the union would argue for a vote for Britain to stay in the EU. Asked on BBC2's Newsnight whether there was "no question that an incoming Labour government would ever offer an in/out referendum on Europe", Mr Balls replied: "That would be a silly thing for us to say." "We made a very clear commitment: if there is any proposal in the next parliament for a transfer of powers to Brussels we will have an in/out referendum. "We are not proposing a referendum now because we think to spend two or three years blighting investment and undermining our economy on the prospect of a referendum which David Cameron says he is going to have after he gets an unknown package of reforms would be bad for jobs and investment. "If Len McCluskey is supporting the David Cameron position, I disagree with Len McCluskey." McCluskey told the conference that "ducking this question is seen as part of Labour's commitment to business". I would not like to be Ed Miliband explaining why he is not joining other parties in offering the British people a vote on something that is clearly a growing source of public concern.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing 298
Foreign minister denies missile that shot down Malaysia Airlines jet over east of country came from Ukrainian military Ukraine's foreign minister says there is no chance that the missile apparently used to shoot down a Malaysia Airlines jet over the east of the country was of Ukrainian military origin. Pavlo Klimkin told the Guardian on Friday morning that the Ukrainian army did not have such missiles in the area, and said none had been seized by separatist fighters in recent weeks. "We are absolutely sure and we checked yesterday that no missiles have been taken from the Ukrainian army," said Klimkin. MH17 crashed near the village of Grabovo on Thursday killing all of its nearly 300 passengers and crew. Separatist fighters in the region have shot down a number of Ukrainian planes and helicopters in recent days, and there is circumstantial evidence pointing to the seizure of a Buk missile system from the Ukrainian army by rebels. A video has surfaced from several days ago in which a well-known Kremlin cheerleader, Sergei Kurginyan, said after a visit to Donetsk in recent days that the rebels had seized a Buk system. Kurginyan said in the video that specialists from Russia had travelled to the region to fix the missile system, "as a friendly gesture to a brotherly nation". Additionally, a news item on Russian state television from late June announced that the rebels had taken control of a Ukrainian Buk system. "Our military forces don't use any sort of anti-air missile in the region of anti-terror operation, so there could be no even theoretical possibility of taking this kind of missile," he told the Guardian. He suggested the missile system could have been smuggled into Ukraine from Russia: "In recent weeks we have had continuous inflow of mercenaries, money, weapons and heavy weaponry across the border, including tanks and Manpads [man-portable air-defence systems]," said Klimkin. He claimed that given the border was several hundred miles long, and in places "controlled by the terrorists", it was possible that a missile system could have been brought across the border without detection. Ukraine's foreign minister said he had spoken overnight to a number of his western counterparts, including the new UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, who offered British assistance and support.

Israel initiates ground maneuver in Gaza Strip
Families wept over bloodied corpses and medical workers rushed to keep up with the wounded Friday as Israeli forces hunted rocket launchers and tunnels that Palestinian militants use to strike Israel. Troops backed by tanks and artillery pressed deeper into the coastal enclave in a ground offensive launched Thursday after 10 days of aerial bombardments failed to halt the rocket fire raining down on Israel's cities and towns from Gaza, which has been controlled by Hamas since 2007. Israel has launched previous campaigns, including a major ground operation early in 2009. Each time, Hamas has quickly rebuilt its arsenal of rockets, which have grown more powerful and can now penetrate deep into Israeli territory. This incursion appeared more limited in scope, targeting a network of tunnels along the enclave's northern, eastern and southern frontiers that militants use to smuggle weapons and fighters into Israel. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters he had instructed the military to prepare for the possibility of a “considerable expansion of the ground operation.” “We chose to embark on this operation after exhausting the other options and with the understanding that without the operation, we could pay a much higher price,” Netanyahu said as he headed into a meeting of his Security Cabinet. Video L.A. Times photographer describes scene in Gaza City Related video: Los Angeles Times photographer Carolyn Cole describes the scene in Gaza City after heavy shelling and missile attacks. The country's Iron Dome antimissile system, built with U.S. assistance, has helped keep Israeli casualties to a minimum. One Israeli was killed by shelling from Gaza, and an Israeli soldier was killed during the ground operation. The cause of the military death was under investigation, but Israeli news reports said that friendly fire was suspected. Nearly 300 Palestinians have been killed, most of them civilians, by Israeli airstrikes and ground attacks, according to Gaza medical officials quoted by the Maan news agency.

Thirteen Israeli soldiers, scores of Palestinians killed in deadly day of fighting in Gaza Strip
The Palestinian death toll in the conflict between Hamas and Israel reached 548 on Monday as officials said four were killed when a Gaza hospital was hit by Israeli fire. It followed the bloodiest day of the conflict so far on Sunday when at least 120 Palestinians were killed in Shujai'iya, a third of them women and children. Thirteen Israeli soldiers were also killed – two of them US citizens – in the heaviest loss of life for the Israeli military in years. Staff at the al-Asqa Martyrs hospital were said to be in shock that the building was hit. "People can't believe this is happening – that a medical hospital was shelled without the briefest warning. It was already full with patients," said Fikr Shalltoot, director of programmes at Medical Aid for Palestinians in Gaza city. Photograph: Mohammed Abed/AFP/Getty Images The US president, Barack Obama, has called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Israel continued its action on the Gaza City neighbourhood of Shujai'iya on Monday, where bombardment and fierce fighting on the ground the day before had left shattered streets littered with bodies. Twenty-five members of the same family were reported killed in an air strike in the south of Gaza, and a further 10 people were killed near Khan Younis.

The fighting in Gaza continues at a great cost to both sides
Gaza City (CNN) -- The death toll on both sides of the Gaza battle jumped Monday, as Palestinian officials reported scores more killed and Israel announced seven more soldiers died -- including several on Israeli soil. About 576 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza Health Ministry officials said. It's unknown how many were militants, but the United Nations has estimated that 70% are civilians. In total, 27 Israeli soldiers have died, including three believed killed by friendly fire. Two of the soldiers who died over the weekend were dual Israeli-American citizens: California native Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli, from South Padre Island, Texas, the U.S. State Department said. Israel's Iron Dome defense system helps protect its residents from missile attacks. Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni told CNN that the reports of hospital shelling are being questioned, "and we will make all the facts found public." "Civilian casualties are a tragic inevitability of the brutal and systematic exploitation of homes, hospitals and mosques in Gaza," the IDF said.

US major general killed, 15 others wounded in insider attack in Afghanistan
Story highlights Afghan Ministry of Defense names assailant as academy member named Rafiullah Army chief of staff confirms death of Maj. Gen. Harold Greene Afghan soldier believed to be shooter, says Pentagon spokesman Analyst: "It creates a crisis of confidence for the Afghans and for us" It was a brazen attack, resulting in the death of the most senior U.S. officer since 9/11, and officials have named the attacker as a member of Afghan's military. Maj. Gen. Harold Greene -- a longtime officer who was leading efforts to train soldiers in Afghanistan -- was killed Tuesday at a military training facility in Kabul. An ISAF official said that the group was standing outside, and the attacker, who has been identified by the Afghan Ministry of Defense as an academy member named Rafiullah, shot from inside a nearby building at a distance of about 100 yards. The assailant had served in the academy for two and a half years, Zahir Azimi, an Afghan Ministry of Defense spokesperson, told CNN. Pentagon officials went out of their way to say the shooting would not change the relationship between U.S. and Afghan forces. "I've seen no indication that there's a degradation of trust between coalition members and their Afghan counterparts," Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters Tuesday.

Nigerian military launch counter-attack as Boko Haram insurgency believed to spread to Cameroon
MAIDUGURI Nigeria Nigeria's military fought gun battles with Boko Haram Islamists in two key northeastern towns on Friday, after the militants killed dozens of people and drove soldiers out of Gwoza town two days ago, security sources and the military said. On Friday the military launched strikes to push the rebels out of Gwoza, the security sources said, and the garrison town of Damboa, which the militants sacked a month ago. Both towns lie on roads linking Nigeria to Cameroon and Chad. The military has struggled to stamp out the highly mobile, combat-hardened fighters of Boko Haram, which wants to carve an Islamic state out of religiously mixed Nigeria. The group is seen as the main security threat to Africa's biggest economy and leading energy producer. "The special operation which began early in the week is meant to restore law and order to the area and apprehend all terrorists who have been operating in the locality," police spokesman Frank Mba announced on his website. Large sections of remote northeastern Borno state are under siege by the militants, who have killed more than 2,000 people this year - mostly civilians - and displaced hundreds of thousands more, rights groups say. Witnesses and two security sources said heavily armed Boko Haram fighters stormed Gwoza, which lies in a rugged hilly area seen as a Boko Haram stronghold, on Wednesday. Resident Abdullahi Abubakar said the insurgents sprayed the town with automatic gunfire, burning houses and overrunning the palace of its traditional ruler, the Emir of Gwoza. A security source said at least 30 bodies had been counted, with many more in the bush. "I could see the Boko Haram boys roaming the streets of Gwoza on motorbikes shouting 'Allahu Akbar' (God is Great), trying to shoot at us as we fled to the hill," Abubakar said by telephone.

WHO declares Ebola outbreak an international emergency
Image copyright EPA Image caption Many in Liberia say the government's response to the crisis has been inadequate Liberia's information minister has admitted that the country's health care system has been overwhelmed by the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. Lewis Brown told the BBC the system had been "overtaxed" by the outbreak, but that authorities were doing their best in the face of an unprecedented crisis. The medical charity MSF said officials underestimated the outbreak and that the health system was "falling apart". Nearly 1,000 people have died and 1,800 have become infected in West Africa. The Ebola outbreak - the worst ever - is centred on Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, but has spread to other countries in recent months. Mr Lewis told the BBC that the outbreak was affecting Liberia's most populated areas, and that people there were "in denial". "There are religious practices and beliefs, long-held traditional values that are being challenged by the procedures... to cure or at least prevent the spread of disease," he said. He said Liberia's health care system was "not the best in the wold", but rejected accusations that it had not responded quickly enough. "The bottom line is we are at the frontline of a deadly outbreak," Mr Lewis said. Image copyright EPA Image caption The outbreak has killed almost 1,000 people Earlier, the co-ordinator for Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) in Liberia, Lindis Hurum, told the BBC: "Our capacity is stretched beyond anything that we ever done before in regards to Ebola response."

REUTERS/Azad Lashkari Kurdish men display weapons for sale at an arms market in Arbil, capital of the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq, August 17, 2014. REUTERS/Azad Lashkari DOHUK Iraq Kurdish fighters pushed to retake Iraq's largest dam on Sunday and the United States conducted a second day of air strikes in the area in a drive to reverse gains by Islamic State insurgents who have overrun much of the country's north. Islamic State militants have seized several towns and oilfields as well as the Mosul Dam in recent weeks, possibly giving them the ability to flood cities or cut off water and electricity supplies. Asked about a Kurdish push to dislodge the Sunni fundamentalist militants on Sunday, a Kurdish official said the dam had not been retaken but "most of the surrounding area" had been seized. The United States said it conducted 14 air strikes on Sunday against Islamic State fighters near the dam. U.S. Central Command said the latest strikes destroyed three armed vehicles, a vehicle-mounted anti-aircraft and an emplacement of the Islamic State as well as one of the militants' checkpoints. The strikes followed nine U.S. air strikes on Saturday near the dam and the Kurdish capital, Arbil. The U.S. air strike campaign against the Islamic State militants began earlier this month in the first direct U.S. military action in Iraq since the end of 2011, when Washington completed the withdrawal of its troops from the country. Islamic State militants have told residents in the area of the Mosul Dam to leave, according to an engineer who works at the site. The engineer said the militants told him they were planting roadside bombs along roads leading in and out of the facility, possibly in fear of an attack by Kurdish fighters. Witnesses said Kurdish forces had recaptured the mainly Christian towns of Batmaiya and Telasqaf, 30 km (18 miles) from Mosul, the closest they have come to the city since Islamic State insurgents drove government forces out in June.

Taliban attacks in numbers amidst Afghani political stalemate
Some 700 Taliban rebels battle Afghan forces near Kabul as military's capacity to deal with security is tested. Hundreds of Taliban fighters are battling Afghan security forces in Logar, a key province near the capital Kabul, local officials say. Rebels have this summer mounted increasingly intense assaults across several provinces, involving hundreds of fighters, as the country braces for the withdrawal of foreign combat troops after 13 years. "There are some 700 of them and they are fighting Afghan forces for territorial control," Niaz Mohammad Amiri, the provincial governor of Logar province, told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday. The Taliban have dug in at Logar, about an hour's drive south of the capital, and nearby Wardak province to the west, in recent years. They have used the provinces - gateways to the capital - as launchpads for hit-and-run attacks and suicide bombings in Kabul. We have already taken over many security outposts and killed many Afghan forces. The main roads into the capital are all tightly controlled, but the rebels have been able to breach the checkpoints and staged dozens of attacks, killing scores of civilians and soldiers in the city of about five million this year. We have enough forces to deal with it," Esaaqzai said. "The area is under siege and we have already taken over many security outposts and killed many Afghan forces," he said. Meanwhile, provincial government spokesperson Den Mohammad Darwish told Al Jazeera that more than 100 Taliban fighters launched an attack in Narkh district this morning.

Four arrested after building spire in Moscow painted in Ukrainian colors
Two men and two women are facing vandalism charges in Russia after they scaled a famous Stalin-era skyscraper in Moscow and painted its pinnacle in Ukrainian colours. Police arrested the four after the stunt, in which a blue and yellow Ukrainian flag was also planted on top of the spire in an apparent protest at Moscow’s support of separatists fighting government troops in eastern Ukraine. If prosecuted and found guilty they could face up to three years in prison. Images of the painted Soviet star, which is embossed with a hammer and sickle and surrounded by a wreath, spread quickly across social media on Wednesday. The ensemble sits atop a 577ft apartment block on the Kotelnicheskaya embankment of the Moscow River, which is one of seven prominent Stalin-era high-rises in the Russian capital. The Kotelnicheskaya Embankment building in Moscow (AP) "I like very much the fact that, on the eve of celebrating the Ukrainian flag, one of Moscow’s highest buildings was painted in our colours," he said, with a smile.

A city official said the painters had scaled the 32-storey building overnight and then used climbing equipment to reach its spire.

US government to investigate paramilitary policing
Obama orders review of police use of military hardware following Ferguson riots Posted US president Barack Obama has ordered an investigation into whether it is "appropriate" for the military to sell battle-grade hardware to local police, a senior US official says. The order follows widespread criticism of local authorities' use of military gear in Ferguson, Missouri after the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer. Images of police wielding military-style guns and armour during clashes with protesters have shocked many American lawmakers and civil rights groups. The official said Mr Obama "has directed a review of federal programs and funding that enable state and local law enforcement to purchase military equipment". The review will consider "whether these programs are appropriate", whether training with the equipment is sufficient, and whether there is enough federal oversight of the gear's use. The investigation will be headed by "White House staff including the Domestic Policy Council, the National Security Council [and] the Office of Management and Budget", the official said. US weapons makers have been eyeing what they call "adjacent" markets for years, keen to drum up fresh demand for products initially developed for the military, and recently, to offset declines in US and European military spending. Meanwhile, demonstrators in Ferguson have marked two weeks since Mr Brown's death, holding quieter protests as supporters of the officer rallied separately, calling the shooting justified. Mr Brown's funeral, set to take place Monday, is likely to be a focal point for more demonstrations by angry protesters demanding that Darren Wilson, the policeman who pulled the shot the teenager at least six times, face justice.

Islamic State capture Syrian airbase
Hundreds reportedly killed as Islamic State fighters and regime troops fight for control of military base in Raqqa. Islamic State fighters and Syrian regime troops have clashed in fierce battles that reportedly cost hundreds of lives over the Tabqa military air base, the last stronghold of the Syrian army in Raqqa province. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Sunday afternoon that fighters were in control of the base but that clashes were still taking place. Live Box 2012108933861442 Syrian state media later reported that its forces, backed by warplanes, were attacking the rebels after leaving the area and regrouping. State television said army troops were launching "precision strikes" against "terrorist groups in the area, inflicting heavy losses". The air base is one of the most significant government military facilities in the area, containing several warplane squadrons, helicopters, tanks, artillery and ammunition. Hundreds killed The Observatory said at least 346 Islamic State fighters were killed and more than 170 members of government forces had died since Tuesday in the fight over Tabqa base, making it one of the deadliest confrontations between the two groups since the start of Syria's war in 2011. Rami Abdel Rahman, director of the Britain-based Observatory, said the fighters had also seized several checkpoints, hanging up at one the head of a soldier who had been killed in the fighting and decapitated. The battle for Tabqa began earlier this month, with the Islamic State launching its first major assault against the airport on Tuesday. It is the last army stronghold in the Raqqa, after fighters captured Brigade 93 and Division 17 in the northern province, killing dozens of soldiers, many of whom were beheaded. Raqqa province has become the stronghold of the Islamic State, which controls the provincial capital and has declared an Islamic "caliphate" in territory it holds in Syria and Iraq. The group initially fought alongside Syrian opposition groups, but its abuses sparked a backlash from rebels who pushed it out of parts of northern Syria.

US says Egypt and UAE responsible for air attacks on Tripoli

REUTERS/Stringer WASHINGTON The U.S. military believes the governments of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were responsible for a recent series of airstrikes on Islamist factions within Libya, a Pentagon spokesman said on Tuesday. Rear Admiral John Kirby, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, declined to give details of why the Obama administration believed those two countries conducted the mysterious strikes. Three years after rebels toppled longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is sinking deeper into chaos as armed factions battle in various cities and two rival legislatures compete for power. The United Arab Emirates and Egypt have carried out a series of air strikes in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, marking an escalation in the war among Libya’s rival militias that has driven diplomats from the country, according to US officials. The Obama administration did not know about the military intervention, although the US was aware that action by Arab states might come as the crisis worsened, said an official. The air strikes appear to be because of the growing influence and power of Islamist militias. The region’s monarchies and dictatorships are alarmed about Islamist gains from Libya to Syria and Iraq. The air strikes may signal a new willingness by some Arab states to take a more direct military role in the region. Various groups in Libya have been battling for control of Tripoli airport, and the strikes may have been a failed attempt to keep it from falling to extremist groups. Washington has long been worried about a proxy war in Libya, with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE backing more secular militias against Islamist forces supported by Qatar.

REUTERS/Jim Bourg KABUL Afghanistan's disputed presidential election veered further off course on Wednesday after both candidates withdrew their observers from a U.N.-supervised audit of votes that was meant to resolve the crisis. The crisis over the outcome of the vote has raised the spectre of instability, turmoil and perhaps even another round of fighting in a country already battling a potent Taliban insurgency. The audit was part of a U.S.-brokered deal to defuse escalating tension between rivals Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, who have both claimed victory in the ballot intended to mark the country's first democratic transfer of power. "We boycotted the audit process today because it is worthless for us. Let them carry on," Fazel Ahmad Manawi, Abdullah's chief auditor, told Reuters early on Wednesday. A few hours later, the United Nations asked Ghani's team to withdraw its observers in the interests of fairness and it had agreed, according to a team member, who said the withdrawal was unfair but prudent. "Today we requested the team of Dr. Ghani to review whether they should participate actively in the process," U.N. deputy chief Nicholas Haysom told reporters on Wednesday. "Underlying this request was a realization that the audit must not only have integrity, it must be seen to be even-handed by all Afghans," he said. After a pause on Wednesday morning, the audit resumed in the afternoon, Haysom said, adding he did not expect significant further delays as the audit proceeded without the physical presence of representatives from candidates' teams.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov KIEV Ukraine's military said on Monday its forces were battling a Russian tank battalion for control of a vital airport in the east of the country as President Petro Poroshenko accused Moscow of "direct and open aggression" against his country. Ukrainian coastguards meanwhile searched for two seamen missing after one of their patrol boats was sunk in the Sea of Azov by artillery fire from pro-Russian separatists on the shore. Eight other seamen survived Sunday's attack and were being treated for wounds and burns, a border guard official said. Several hundred Ukrainian forces are bogged down near Ilovaysk, east of the region's main city of Donetsk, and have been trying to break out of encirclement by Russian-backed separatists for several days. Poroshenko, speaking at a military academy in Kiev, said Russia's direct involvement in the war against the separatists in eastern Ukraine had tipped the balance on the battlefield and was the main reason for recent reversals. This has changed the situation in the zone of conflict in a radical way," he said. Last week separatists who Kiev says were backed by a Russian armoured column took the town of Novoazovsk in the southeast and are now threatening the strategic port city of Mariupol. Despite growing concerns, Kiev's military has imposed an information clampdown on what is happening in Ilovaysk until its forces have been successfully withdrawn. But Anton Gerashchenko, an interior ministry adviser, told Ukraine TV's 112 channel: "The tragedy near Ilovaysk became possible after (Russian President Vladimir) Putin brought regular troops into Ukraine."

Australia and Afghanistan to be represented at NATO summit
Foreign minister Julie Bishop says Australia will maintain autonomy in future Nato-led operations Australia is set to boost ties with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), the world’s most powerful political and military grouping. Foreign minister Julie Bishop says Australia will accept a formal invitation to become an enhanced partner when she and defence minister David Johnston attend the Nato leaders’ summit in Wales this week. Bishop says it is a rare honour for Australia and the Australian Defence Force. Australia’s relationship with Nato strengthened substantially over the past decade due to participation in Nato’s longest mission, the Isaf (International Security Assistance Force) mission in Afghanistan. “Australia has proven itself time and again to be a reliable and capable partner,” she said. Bishop says Australia will maintain autonomy in deciding the extent and character of involvement in future Nato-led operations. REUTERS/Larry Downing SYDNEY Australia is set to step up its partnership with NATO, its foreign minister said on Tuesday, as the country pursues a bigger role in global crises from Iraq and Syria to Ukraine. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who is due to host Russian President Vladimir Putin and other world leaders at a G20 summit in November, has used a number of recent speeches to signal a more muscular approach to foreign policy. Although Australia is not a NATO member, its troops fought alongside the coalition in Iraq and Afghanistan, which Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has called the basis for an expanded partnership in current and future conflicts. "Tomorrow the defence minister and I will travel to Wales to attend the NATO summit and I can confirm that Australia will be accepting a formal invitation to become what is called an enhanced partner," Bishop told parliament. Australia on Monday unveiled fresh sanctions against Russia over what Abbott called its "bullying" of neighbouring Ukraine, where the Kremlin is accused of backing pro-Russian insurgent groups battling the government in Kiev.

NATO leaders meet for two day summit in Wales
US secretary of state John Kerry rules out committing 'boots on the ground' at meeting of 10 nations on sidelines of Nato summit Barack Obama has called Islamic State (Isis) a "savage organisation" that must be destroyed as the US announced the formation of a "core coalition" to combat militants in Iraq, but warned it might take two or three years to squeeze the jihadis from the region. Speaking at the Nato summit in Wales, the US president said the organisation's members unanimously agreed on the need for immediate action against Isis militants because they pose a threat to members of the alliance. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said a new 10-nation grouping would concentrate on strengthening the forces in Iraq who were fighting against Isis, but said intervention would not extend to western powers sending in troops. "We need to attack them in ways that prevent them from taking over territory, to bolster the Iraqi security forces and others in the region who are prepared to take them on, without committing troops of our own," Kerry said. "Obviously I think that's a red line for everybody here: no boots on the ground." He said the grouping should come up with firm plans - and greater support from regional powers - by the time the UN general assembly meets for its annual session later this month. Significantly, the group does not include any Arab nation and only one of Iraq's six neighbours. Obama said the international coalition needed to go beyond western countries and include Sunni majority states, in order to reject the kind of nihilism that Isis projects.

Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announce second pregnancy
Prince George has already earned the nickname "Republican slayer," so perhaps it comes as little surprise that the second child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge is already being touted — months before birth — for his or her potential as a political symbol. Within hours of word spreading Monday that Prince William and Kate are expecting a brother or sister for 13-month-old George, the U.K. media were pondering what it could all mean for the upcoming Scottish independence vote. Prince William talks to schoolchildren during a visit in Oxford, England, on Sept. 8, the same day it was announced he and his wife, Kate, are expecting their second child. (Lefteris Pitarakis/Associated Press) "What's interesting is that on the day of the announcement, the upcoming royal baby has already assumed political significance," says Carolyn Harris, a Toronto-based royal historian and blogger. The Scottish referendum is just over a week away, and media speculation was swirling Monday "that enthusiasm about a new royal baby might help keep the United Kingdom together," Harris says. And it's rampant speculation: Even the Guardian newspaper, which has been known to give online readers the chance to opt out of royal coverage with one click, had a poll asking if word of a baby on the way "is the news the No campaign desperately needs?" The announcement of the pending birth seems to have been spurred by Kate's acute morning sickness, and the questions that would have arisen over her absence at a planned event Monday in Oxford. But others took a contrary view about the timing of the announcement in light of the political question looming over Scotland and suggestions that the Queen — the great-grandmother-in-waiting — is quite concerned that Scots may vote to leave the 307-year-old union. "There are those cynics, of course, who say 'What timing,'" royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams told CBC News Network. "The Royal Family are symbols of togetherness and unity and those who are wavering as to how to vote — and as you know the polls have got so close — they might think again and vote to keep the union if and when they've given it the thought after this very happy, and may I say timely, news." (Phil Noble/Reuters) If the next royal baby does carry some serious political clout, he or she will follow in the footsteps of George, who as a chubby-cheeked nine-month-old charmed adoring fans Down Under earlier this year.

REUTERS/Brendan Smialowski/Pool BAGHDAD U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday endorsed Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's plans to mend Baghdad's relations with Sunnis and Kurds, and said Iraq was a partner in the fight against Islamic State militants. Kerry, on a tour of the Middle East to build military, political and financial support to defeat the militants controlling parts of Iraq and Syria, said: "We all have an interest in supporting the new government of Iraq." "The coalition that is at the heart of our global strategy I assure you will continue to grow and deepen in the days ahead ... because the United States and the world will simply not stand by to watch as ISIL's evil spreads." Now the Iraqi parliament has approved a new cabinet with new leaders, with representation from all Iraqi communities, it’s full steam ahead." Kerry's visit comes hours before a speech in which Obama will try to rally Americans behind another war in a region he has long sought to leave, backed by what Washington hopes will be a coalition of NATO and Gulf Arab allies committed to a campaign that could stretch beyond the end of Obama’s term in 2016. "When the world hears from President Obama this evening, he will lay out with great specificity each component of a broad strategy of how to deal with ISIL," Kerry said. Kerry told Abadi he was encouraged by his plans for "reconstituting" the military and his commitment to political reforms reaching out to all of Iraq's religious and ethnic communities. Abadi formed his government on Monday in what was billed as a break from the more abrasive style of his predecessor Nuri al-Maliki, whose policies were blamed by many Iraqis for fuelling sectarianism and pushing the country to the brink of collapse.

Northern Irish politician Reverend Ian Paisley dies aged 88
Unionist leader who led opposition to compromise with IRA in Northern Ireland before entering government with Sinn Féin had been ill for some time The former leader of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) Dr Ian Paisley has died aged 88, his widow said. The firebrand preacher-turned-politician died on Friday morning, according to Eileen Paisley, a fellow member of the House of Lords. She said the family was heartbroken by the death of a figure who dominated Ulster Unionist politics for nearly six decades. In a statement released by the Paisley family at lunchtime on Friday, she said: "My beloved husband, Ian, entered his eternal rest this morning. We loved him and he adored us, and our earthly lives are forever changed." Paisley, or Lord Bannside as he was known in his latter years, embarked on a remarkable political journey that started with him opposing mild reforms to the unionist-dominated Northern Ireland state in the late 1950s and early 60s to sharing power with his one-time mortal enemies Sinn Féin in the 21st century.

But after fulfilling his dream in 2005 of becoming the dominant force in unionism, Paisley finally agreed to share power with Sinn Féin, the party he vowed to smash in the 1980s.

At a news conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping, India's PM Narendra Modi said "peace on the border" was important for progress. Talks came as India accused China of fresh territorial incursions in Ladakh. China is one of India's top trading partners but they vie for regional influence and dispute their border. Mr Modi and Mr Xi made separate statements at the end of their talks in Delhi on Thursday. Under the investment plans, China pledged to: Help bring India's ageing railway system railway system up-to-date with high-speed links and upgraded railway stations. Give more market access to India to products, including pharmaceuticals and farm products. Both sides also focussed on increasing co-operation in trade, space exploration and civil nuclear energy. Mr Modi called for an early settlement on the disputed common border between the two countries and said the "true potential of our relations" would be realised when there was "peace in our relations and in the borders".

Jerry Brown wins fourth term as California governor
Forty years after vaulting onto the national stage as California’s young and quixotic new governor, Edmund G. “Jerry” Brown Jr. won a historic fourth term Tuesday as the seasoned elder who led the state’s recovery from near fiscal disaster, according to the Associated Press. The 76-year-old governor’s reelection came as two fellow Democrats won second terms: Lt. Gov. The early reminders of Democrats' strength in California contrasted with Republican gains in a national midterm election largely defined by the unpopularity of President Obama. In Sacramento on Tuesday night, Brown alluded to the Republicans' capture of the U.S. Senate as he pledged to stay the course with an agenda of fiscal restraint. "In the rest of the country, they're going in a slightly different direction," the governor, accompanied by his wife, Anne Gust Brown, told reporters on a sidewalk outside the historic Governor's Mansion. "In California, we are going to go in, I think, a very progressive but fiscally responsible direction." A big uncertainty was whether the foul national climate for Democrats, combined with a relatively dull ballot in California, would deny the party a two-thirds legislative supermajority that would effectively consign Republicans to irrelevance in Sacramento. The Field Poll projected a record-low turnout of 46% of the state’s nearly 18 million voters, with key Democratic groups sitting out the election more than others: Latinos, women, young voters and residents of Los Angeles County. See more videos Sharon Pruhs, 76, the first voter in line Tuesday at a polling place in Highland Park, captured the lack of enthusiasm as she explained why she backed Brown and other incumbents. “As far as I’m concerned, they’re doing an OK job,” she said.

Philae space probe lands on comet
London (CNN) The comet probe Philae may have bounced when it landed, the European Space Agency said Wednesday. It is the first time a soft landing has been achieved on a comet -- but there was a hitch. Comet 67P has a very weak gravity, so anchoring harpoons were designed to shoot into the comet to fix the spacecraft to the surface. They failed to fire and Philae is not firmly secure, ESA says. Philae lander manager Stephan Ulamec said the probe may have lifted off again and turned. "So maybe we didn't land once -- we landed twice," he told a news conference. "Did we land in a soft sandbox or is there something else happening? We don't fully understand what happened," he said. Ulamec said scientists remain upbeat as they are still receiving data from the spacecraft and they hope to learn more Thursday. Later, it tweeted again: "I'm on the surface but my harpoons did not fire." #CometLanding — Philae Lander (@Philae2014) November 12, 2014 Led by ESA with a consortium of partners including NASA, scientists on the Rosetta comet-chasing mission hope to learn more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the solar wind -- high energy particles blasted into space by the sun.

Senate publish report on CIA torture and misinformation
A long-awaited Senate report concludes that the CIA repeatedly misled the public, Congress and the White House about the agency’s aggressive questioning of detainees — including waterboarding, confinement in small spaces and shackling in stress positions — after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, minimizing the severity of the interrogations and exaggerating the usefulness of the information produced, including its role in setting in motion the U.S. raid that killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The Senate Intelligence Committee report finds that the “Enhanced Interrogation Techniques” program escaped effective scrutiny by outsiders long after its inception in 2002, with CIA records showing that President George W. Bush was never briefed by the agency on specific techniques such as waterboarding until 2006. Top Bush administration officials such as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell were not told of the practices until September 2003. Story Continued Below The congressional review also says that the CIA’s actual tactics often went far beyond the terms laid out in Justice Department legal opinions, subjecting detainees to prolonged interrogation under a combination of harsh techniques and ignoring safeguards set forth in the legal memos such as ensuring that interrogators were well-trained and had high-level approvals before using the unusually aggressive tactics. President Barack Obama issued a statement that stopped short of completely endorsing the report’s conclusions, but he reiterated his opposition to the Bush-era interrogation practices. ( Also on POLITICO: Obama's long arc on torture) “The report documents a troubling program involving enhanced interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects in secret facilities outside the United States, and it reinforces my long-held view that these harsh methods were not only inconsistent with our values as a nation, they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our national security interests,” Obama said. “These techniques did significant damage to America’s standing in the world and made it harder to pursue our interests with allies and partners.” Obama was silent on the issues of whether the CIA misled outsiders about the program and about whether it produced important intelligence but he emphasized that he banned the harsh techniques soon after he took office “Rather than another reason to refight old arguments, I hope that today’s report can help us leave these techniques where they belong — in the past,” he said. Alleged Al Qaeda organizer Abu Zubaydah was interrogated continuously for 17 consecutive days, being subjected to 183 waterboarding sessions and confinement in stress positions.

AirAsia jet vanishes over Indonesia, 162 missing
Searchers "currently suspect" that the AirAsia jetliner that disappeared Sunday morning over the Java Sea is on the bottom of the ocean, the head of the lead agency in the operation said today. "We currently suspect that plane is located on the ocean floor," Bambang Soelistyo, the head of Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency said. If the plane is found on the ocean floor, there would be a challenge in getting the plane to the surface because they do not have the "submersible" equipment, Soelistyo said. The plane's Emergency Locator Transmitter should function automatically and send warning signals, but no signal has been detected by control centers in Indonesia or in neighboring countries, Soelistyo said. Soelistyo confirmed that Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency is spearheading the search effort. The AirAsia jet lost contact with air traffic control over the Java Sea during a flight to Singapore Sunday morning, shortly after the pilots requested a change of flight plan because of weather. The Australian Defence Force deployed a Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion Maritime Patrol Aircraft to assist in the search, the Australian Department of Defense announced. Ships engaged in the search and rescue effort reached the area where the plane was believed to be lost around Belitung Island at approximately 6:49 a.m., a spokeswoman for the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency said. Darkness and bad weather had forced the suspension of the search about 5:30 p.m. local time Sunday evening, said Indonesian transport officials. Flight QZ8501, an Airbus A320-200, lost contact with air traffic control in Jakarta at 6:17 a.m. Sunday local time near Belitung Island, Indonesia, after the flight left Surabaya, Indonesian Air Transport Director Djoko Murjatmodjo said during a news conference Sunday. "We are deeply shocked and saddened by this incident," said Sunu Widyatmoko, CEO of AirAsia Indonesia.

Four of the magazine's well-known cartoonists, including its editor, were among those killed, as well as two police officers. A major police operation is under way to find three gunmen who fled by car. President Francois Hollande said there was no doubt it had been a terrorist attack "of exceptional barbarity". It is believed to be the deadliest attack in France since 1961, when right-wingers who wanted to keep Algeria French bombed a train, killing 28 people. The masked attackers opened fire with assault rifles in the office and exchanged shots with police in the street outside before escaping by car. They later abandoned the car in Rue de Meaux, northern Paris, where they hijacked a second car. Death threats Witnesses said they heard the gunmen shouting "We have avenged the Prophet Muhammad" and "God is Great" in Arabic ("Allahu Akbar").

John Boehner re-elected as US House Speaker despite conservative challenge
John Boehner dished out a little payback, kicking two House Republicans off the influential Rules Committee and stopping a third from sponsoring a bill after they voted against his re-election for speaker. The returning Republican members of the rules panel were announced late Tuesday after the election for the chamber’s top post, in which 24 of Boehner’s fellow party members didn’t vote for him. Absent from the list: Florida Representatives Daniel Webster, who voted for himself for speaker, and Rich Nugent, who also voted for Webster. Boehner confirmed today that the two “weren’t put back on the committee immediately.” Speaking to reporters after House Republicans’ weekly private meeting, he said they are “going to have a family conversation, which we had this morning, about bringing our team together.” Webster and Nugent, who served on the Rules Committee in the last Congress, were on the list to be reappointed until they voted for Webster for speaker, according to a House leadership aide who asked anonymity to provide details of private discussions. Nugent said today he might be returned to the Rules panel. “I’m not on Rules, I will tell you that,” Nugent said. I carried a lot of water on the Rules Committee, took a lot of tough votes.” Sponsoring Bill Unlike Nugent, Webster said he wasn’t particularly interested in winning back a seat on the committee. “Do you see people running to get on it?” he said with a laugh. Representative Randy Weber, a Texas Republican, said Boehner won’t let him sponsor a bill headed for House floor consideration because he voted for Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas for speaker. Not ’Self-Serving’ “Making decisions for everybody is what the Rules Committee does,” he said.

Sri Lanka to investigate alleged coup attempt by outgoing president
Sri Lanka's newly elected president Mithripala Sirisena waves at media as he leaves the election commission in Colombo January 9, 2015. REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte COLOMBO Sri Lanka's new government promised a tolerant era of harmony and political freedom after years of mounting repression under a decade-old administration that unraveled in electoral defeat this week. In a speech on Sunday, President Maithripala Sirisena vowed to end corruption and nepotism that marred the reputation of his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa, who stepped down on Friday after his shock election loss.Speaking from the highland jungle city of Kandy, the seat of Sri Lanka's last Sinhalese kingdom, Sirisena asked for continued support of religious minorities who helped him win the election. "While protecting the country's main religion Buddhism, we also protect the rights and freedom of Hindu, Muslim, and Catholic people in practicing their religion and create consensus among them to build up this country," he told a large crowd. Sirisena's speech came as the country prepares to receive Pope Francis, who is expected to deliver a message of inter-faith dialogue on a trip starting on Tuesday. Rajapaksa became a hero to many for ending Sri Lanka's 26 year civil war with a crushing victory over Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009. But critics accused him of crimes at the brutal end of the war and he also oversaw censorship and persecution of minorities, political rivals and journalists. He ignored pressure to address rights issues and ensure media freedom even after a U.S.-backed United Nations resolution in March urged the country to prosecute war criminals. Sirisena, who was acting defense minister under Rajapaksa in the final stages of the war and only defected to the opposition in November, is unlikely to accept a U.N. war crimes probe. "I will take all the steps to eliminate corruption, loopholes, and bribes completely from this country," he said, adding that he would make the police force politically neutral.

Millions march in France and around the world in support of Charlie Hebdo
(CNN) At least 3.7 million people, including world leaders, marched in anti-terrorism rallies in Paris and elsewhere in France on Sunday, French officials said, calling the massive gathering in the nation's capital the largest in France's history. The day was emotional and peaceful, a gesture of unity just days after Islamic extremists slaughtered 17 people. The day also brought together an unlikely duo at the rally: Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A photographer captured Merkel leaning her head gently on Hollande's shoulder. At times, today's #ParisMarch feels like a family funeral, full of sadness, unity & tender moments like this pic.twitter.com/LP1iqyPfQ0 The rally began with a march through Paris streets at 3 p.m., but a massive group of people stayed into the night. One man in the crowd said the French people must not "give in to fear." Others carried signs that echoed the now-famous phrase that honored slain journalists at the magazine Charlie Hebdo, "Je suis Charlie." Zineb El Rhazoui, a journalist at the magazine, talked about the magazine's financial struggles and the difficulty of working under constant threats: "I am very happy for all this help, but for us, it was a heavy price to pay, and it is too much. "It took 12 deaths for us to finally be a little bit understood after we have been hated and booed by everybody." For everyone, no matter their race, class or ethnic background, signs that said "We are all French" were held up with pride.

Greek singer Demis Roussos dies aged 68
Greek singer Demis Roussos, who sold more than 60 million records throughout the world, died on January 25 2015 in an Athens hospital at the age of 68. The Egyptian-born singer, who became popular in the Sixties and Seventies, had been in the private hospital with an undisclosed illness for some time. Artemios Roussos was born in Alexandria on June 15, 1945 to a Greek father who took the family back to Greece in 1961, following the effects of the Suez Crisis in the mid-Fifties. Demis started his musical career as a cabaret musician, having learned guitar, trumpet and piano in school. Roussos went on to become a global superstar with his solo hits Forever and Ever, Mr Reason, Goodbye My Love, Goodbye, Velvet Mornings, Lovely Lady Of Arcadia and Quand je t'aime. His theatrical figure, with a flowing dark beard, intense dark eyes and long hair thinning on top, became one of the musical faces of the Seventies. Roussos was caught up in one of the major news events of the Eighties when on June 14 1985, while he was among 153 people travelling from Athens to Rome, his TWA Flight 847 was hijacked by two Shiite Muslim militiamen. He was released unharmed five days later, and at a press conference thanked his captors for giving him a birthday cake. Roussos had long struggled with his weight (at one time he was 319 pounds/145 kilograms), and in latter years suffered ill-health that kept him chair-bound.

Gas explosion flattens Mexico City maternity hospital
(CNN) A gas truck driver and two assistants were arrested Friday in connection with a deadly gas explosion that leveled part of a maternity hospital in Mexico City, killing at least three people and injuring dozens, authorities said. The blast occurred at about 7 a.m. Thursday with more than 100 people inside Cuajimalpa Maternal Hospital -- minutes after a hose burst on a truck supplying gas to the building. Rescuers rushed from the rubble with babies in their arms. The truck operator was identified as Julio César Martínez and his two assistants as Carlos Chavez and Salvador Alatorre, according to Rodolfo Rios Garza, a local attorney. Two of men in custody are hospitalized, and a third, with less serious injuries, was checked at a hospital. Ivonne Lugo Durantes told CNNMexico she spent 10 minutes trapped under rubble before rescuers reached her. As she described what was happening, he heard people in the background screaming for help. It was a nightmare," she said, describing how hospital workers tried to rescue babies from a nursery as flames engulfed the building.

South African apartheid assassin Eugene de Kock granted parole
Eugene de Kock, the man known as “Prime Evil” for leading an apartheid death squad that killed and tortured scores of people, will be released from prison, South Africa’s justice minister said on Friday. Michael Masutha said he took the decision to grant de Kock parole after consultation with the families of his victims. “In the interest of reconciliation and nation building, I have placed Mr de Kock on parole,” Mr Masutha said, adding that the date and nature of his release would be kept secret. De Kock, 66, was sentenced in 1996 to two life sentences for six murders and an additional 212 years for charges ranging from attempted murder to kidnapping and fraud. His testimony to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission about the activities of his death squad shocked his fellow countrymen by its graphic nature. The decision to release de Kock was met with mixed reaction in South Africa, which is still largely divided along racial and socio-economic lines 20 years after the end of apartheid, and where his name still embodies the visceral cruelty of the old system. Jane Quin, the sister of Jacqui Quin, whose death in Lesotho in 1985 was ordered by de Kock, said it was a “complete travesty” and his debt to society was “not paid”. “I feel terribly disappointed,” she said. “He should have served his full sentence.” Madeleine Fullard, who leads the National Prosecuting Authority’s Missing Persons Task Team, said de Kock’s release meant he could help them find more bodies. “He has already assisted in the locating of two bodies but his key role has been to introduce us to other former security police who can assist with finding others,” she said. His release may help us speed up the process.” Asked if de Kock had appeared repentant when the two met at the grave of an ANC activist, she said: “He certainly feels lives were wasted for no reason.

Fire ravages large academic library in Moscow
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Library Director Yuri Pivovarov: "They saved the books" A fire has destroyed parts of one of Russia's largest public libraries, containing more than 14 million items. The blaze began late on Friday at the Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences in a south-western district of the capital, Moscow. The roof collapsed but the library's rare medieval Slavic texts appear undamaged. The institute's director Yuri Pivovarov said firefighters had done "everything possible" to save the texts. "What is important is that they saved the books, the books did not suffer," he said. But Vladimir Fortov, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said around 15% of the library's items were damaged, comparing it to a cultural Chernobyl, referring to the 1986 nuclear power plant accident in Ukraine. "It's a major loss for science. This is the largest collection of its kind in the world, probably equivalent to the (United States) Library of Congress," he was quoted in Russian media as saying. The cause of the blaze is unclear, but one source told the RIA Novosti news agency that an electrical short-circuit was the leading line of inquiry. Over 200 firefighters worked at the scene to douse the blaze but could not prevent a section of roof collapsing before the fire was contained shortly after midnight.

Hard drugs temporarily legal in Ireland due to constitutional loophole
Twitter erupted in confusion today, after a stranger-than-fiction legal case saw over 100 drugs including ecstasy, ketamine and magic mushrooms become legal in Ireland for one night only. Following a decision by the Court of Appeal to challenge the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and strike down legislation banning the possession of the substances, the Irish parliament is scrabbling to rush through emergency laws overnight to shut down the loophole. A man prosecuted for possessing methylethcathinone in 2012 launched the case, and denied criminal charges of supplying the substance and argued the regulations were unconstitutional. The substance also known as 4-mec or snow blow is one of around 100 brought under a blanket ban in Ireland four years ago, which forced head shops around the country out of business overnight. Drug addiction, overdoses, and a very brief history of Heroin    14 show all Drug addiction, overdoses, and a very brief history of Heroin             1/14 Heroin – the chemical name for which is diacetylmorphine – was originally synthesized by British chemist C.R.Alder Wright (pictured overleaf) in 1874, by adding two acetyl groups to the molecule morphine, which is naturally found in the opium poppy. 2/14 Bayer, the German pharmaceutical company behind Alka-Seltzer and Aspirin, bought the rights to diacetylmorphine, marketing it under the name “Heroin” in 1895 because early testers said that it made them feel “heroisch” or “heroic”. It was originally sold as an over-the-counter cough suppressant that didn’t have problematic side effects, like addiction (the irony) - while alternative treatments morphine and codeine did. This was before they realised that, when taken into the body, it actually converts into morphine, and is ferociously addictive. Thus defeating the object and defining what was to become a historically embarrassing moment for the company in later years. 4/14 By 1899 Bayer was producing a ton of Heroin and exporting the drug to 23 countries, while free samples sent to doctors and studies appeared in medical journals. The company wisely released Aspirin this year, which would go on to become one of the most popular and widely used pain relief drugs in the world. 6/14 As Heroin dependency became a torrent and overdoses began to be reported, Heroin was made illegal to obtain without a prescription from a doctor in the US in 1914.

BBC suspend presenter Jeremy Clarkson over 'fracas' with producer
In the end it wasn’t Jeremy Clarkson’s racist, homophobic or sexist comments, but a “fracas” with a colleague that became the final straw for the BBC, long urged to punish its highest-paid star. A tight-lipped corporation said on Tuesday it had suspended the controversial Top Gear presenter pending an investigation into his “fracas with a BBC producer” and, for the first time, it pulled the show from its schedule for the next two Sundays. Perhaps ominously for Clarkson, the statement said “no one else has been suspended”. Amid allegations that the incident involved Clarkson throwing a punch at a male producer, there was some doubt over when the last three episodes of the current series would be broadcast. The Radio Times reported that the penultimate episode of the series, due to air on 22 March, had been replaced by a documentary about the Caribbean. According to the Daily Mirror the producer involved in the alleged bust-up, said to have taken place after filming in Newcastle, was named Oisin Tymon, aged 36. Meanwhile an online petition calling for the 54-year-old’s reinstatement soared past 130,000 signatures. The Mirror reported the “fracas” was over a lack of catering, with the paper quoting a source as saying: “They came to the end of filming after a long day and Jeremy discovered that no food had been laid on.” The presenter then “snapped”, the source added. But according to the Sun newspaper, Clarkson said: “I’m having a nice cold pint and waiting for this to blow over.” After learning about the “fracas”, senior BBC bosses – understood to include the director general, Tony Hall, and head of television, Danny Cohen – made the decision to suspend the presenter. Although there had been little response to the incident from Clarkson, whose manager and personal assistant refused to return calls on Tuesday evening, the presenter did reply on Twitter to his on-screen partners, Richard Hammond and James May.

Suicide bombers attack mosques in Sanaa, Yemen
At least 137 people killed and 345 injured as three blasts target two mosques in central Sanaa. Suicide bombers have attacked two mosques in the Yemeni capital during the rush for Friday prayers, killing 137 people and injuring 345 others, sources told Al Jazeera. Three blasts were heard in two central mosques used by Houthi Shia Muslims, sources said. A report on the Houthi-funded Al-Masirah TV channel said the bombers attacked the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques during midday prayers on Friday. According to witnesses, one of the suicide bombers detonated his explosives inside the Badr mosque, causing panic as dozens of worshippers rushed toward the outside gates. A second bomber then attacked amid the panicked crowds trying to escape. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) armed group, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attacks on Twitter. It threatened that these attacks were "only a part of the coming flood". However, Al Jazeera's Rosiland Jordan said that intelligence experts believe ISIL's claim was questionable, saying they suspect either al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) or anti-Houthi fighters were behind the attacks. Nadwa Dawsari, a conflict analyst, said that it is "highly unlikely" that ISIL carried out the attack, and that it was politically motivated. "I really don't buy the ISIL propaganda [...] Yemen doesn't have the grounds for ISIL, at least not yet. I think these attacks were politically motivated and whoever ordered them want people to believe its ISIL to achieve political goals".

Utah reinstates firing squad for death penalty
Activists point out state is bucking national trend of moving away from death penalty and say it should be following suit ‘not trying to fix the unfixable’ Human rights campaigners have condemned Utah’s decision to reinstate the firing squad as a viable form of capital punishment as “backward” and “brutalizing”. State governor Gary Herbert described the execution method as “a little bit gruesome” as he was signing a new law on Monday to allow it in cases where authorities are unable to administer a lethal injection. Utah had previously allowed death by firing squad as an unusual option that condemned prisoners could choose, but it will now use it as a compulsory fallback provision when the state has difficulty buying the drugs needed for lethal injection, because of supplier boycotts. “The Utah legislature should be expending its energies on abolishing the death penalty, not trying to fix the unfixable,” said Rob Freer, a US researcher with Amnesty International. He called the law “just the latest attempt by one of the more diehard death penalty states to keep alive a punishment it should have killed off long ago”. Freer pointed out that Utah was bucking the trend in the US where, since 2007, six states have abolished the death penalty and three more have declared a moratorium on executions. “Whether by shooting, lethal injection, hanging, asphyxiation or electrocution, the death penalty is a cruel, brutalizing and outdated punishment that is a symptom of violence, not a solution to it,” Freer added. “We believe all current methods of capital punishment violate the eighth amendment to the US constitution that outlaws cruel and unusual punishment, but this particular method, firing squad, seems very barbaric and something more associated with war,” said Karen McCreary, executive director of the ACLU of Utah, who testified to the state legislature against the adoption of the method. Utah’s new law allows the state to use a firing squad only if the lethal injection drugs are unavailable 30 days before an execution is scheduled to take place. “Those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state,” said Marty Carpenter, spokesman for Herbert. “We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty, and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued. However, when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant, enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch.” The statement emphasised that lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in Utah. At a press conference last week, Herbert told reporters that he preferred the lethal injection method, but said “we need to have a fallback”.

US Senator Harry Reid announces he will not seek re-election
Washington (CNN) Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said Friday he won't seek reelection in 2016, and endorsed New York Sen. Charles Schumer as his successor for his leadership post. He said in a video posted on Twitter and YouTube that the bruises were "nothing," but added that "this accident has caused us for the first time to have a little bit of downtime ... time to ponder and to think." President Barack Obama praised Reid on Friday, calling into an NPR interview that the Nevada senator was giving to say that Reid was "one of my best partners and best friends." "Harry is unique and he's got that curmudgeonly charm that is hard to replace," Obama told Nevada Public Radio. But the good thing is that I'm going to leave this place at the same time." Reid was a top GOP target and expecting a fierce reelection fight, and he says in the video that he feels it would be "inappropriate" for him to "soak up all those resources" while Democrats have a real shot at taking back the Senate. "The decision I made has absolutely nothing to do with my injury, and it has nothing to do with my being majority leader, and it certainly has nothing to do with my ability to be reelected, because the path to reelection is much easier than it probably has been any time that I've run for reelection," he said in his video announcing his retirement. A member of Reid's staff tells CNN that the senator made the decision to retire with his family around Christmas, but told his staff that he wanted two months or so to sit on it before announcing it. This aide says Reid has been telling people in private meetings that it's not so much about how he feels physically, which he says is great — the decision was based on how he would feel in eight years, which remains an open question.

RGP said officers were alerted to the incident at 11:35 local time (10:35 BST) after a member of staff from the apartment letting agency called at the property. "They got no answer from within but noticed that the house was locked from inside and that sent a few alarm bells ringing and they decided to call the police," a spokesman said. "At the moment what we are doing is trying to get as much background information from both the Spanish and the UK sides of the family." He added the family had only been in Gibraltar for a few days.

Gun control campaigner Sarah Brady dies aged 73
Brady, who became involved in campaigning after her husband was shot in the head in the assassination attempt on President Reagan, has died of pneumonia Sarah Kemp Brady, who became an activist for gun control after her husband was shot in the head in the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, has died. Brady, 73, died in a retirement community in Alexandria, Virginia on Friday after battling pneumonia, family members said in an email. Brady’s husband, former White House press secretary James Brady, died on 4 August, also at the age of 73. Four years later, Sarah Brady became involved in gun control. “Sarah courageously stepped up after Jim was shot to prevent others from enduring what our family has gone through, and her work has saved countless lives,” the family’s statement said. “Sarah was a voice of strength, love and encouragement, and she inspired others, showing that one person could make a difference and change the world — which she did.” Dan Gross, president of Brady Campaign, called Sarah Brady “its guiding light”. “There are countless people walking around today who would not be were it not for Sarah Brady’s remarkable resilience, compassion,” Gross said. In a statement emailed by the Reagan Foundation, she wrote: “Just over 34 years ago, we shared an experience that bonded us for life, as we comforted each other in a tiny, windowless office at the George Washington University hospital emergency room, while awaiting word about whether our husbands would survive the horrific gunshots that had brought them there.” But that wasn't why his wife, Sarah, became a warrior in a daunting political fight. During a visit to her husband's hometown in Illinois in the summer of 1985, a friend gave Brady and her then-6-year-old son, Scott, a ride in his truck.

Labour grabs poll lead in UK General Election campaign
Half of the UK workforce would be given three days’ paid leave each year to volunteer, under Conservative plans unveiled on Friday. Every public sector worker and anyone working in a company with at least 250 employees – more than 15 million people in total - would be entitled to the volunteering leave, David Cameron is expected to announce. The Prime Minister will say the pledge is “clearest demonstration of the Big Society in action”. Currently full-time UK workers are entitled to 28 days’ paid leave a year, including bank holidays. Workers could use the paid leave to carry out charity work or other activities such as serving as a school governor, under the plans, which would create up to an extra 360 million volunteering hours. David Cameron said: “This election is about building a better future for our children and grandchildren. But Conservatives know the society we build on top of that is just as important too. It’s good for our economy, as it will help create a better, more motivated workforce. And it’s good for our society too, as it will strengthen communities and the bonds between us. “This is the clearest demonstration of the Big Society in action – and I’m proud it’s a Conservative Government that will deliver it.” The Big Society was one of Mr Cameron's flagship ideas to empower local communities, but has been criticised for lack of substance. A series of high profile business figures welcomed the new plans for paid volunteering leave.

UK Independence Party reject leader's resignation
I’m proud that Ukip fought the most positive election campaign of all the parties up until May 7th. We had a message, “Believe in Britain” that we know resonated with more than four million people across this country. Contrast that to the other parties, who used scare tactics about our NHS, about the Scottish Nationalists, and about Britain’s membership of the European Union. These are the points I had to consider today, when Ukip’s National Executive Committee met and discussed my resignation. I had promised in my book, the Purple Revolution , that if I lost in the South Thanet constituency, I would stand down as Ukip leader. This might have accounted for how much negativity the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, and the trade unions threw at me in that seat over the past few months. It was only about 20 minutes after the results in South Thanet had come in, that I stood on the cliffs outside the Botany Bay Hotel, surrounded by the nation’s media, and confirmed that I would be handing my resignation to the National Executive Committee today. What followed was something that had crossed my mind, but that I had never truly expected. UKIP’s NEC overwhelmingly refused my resignation, citing the party membership support as a reason for which I should stay on. I was left in a situation that made it clear; there was only one person the NEC wanted for the job, and the party membership was in support. So, I breathed deep, and thought for as long as I possibly had, given the meeting was ongoing, and still is, at my time of writing this.

Jim Murphy announces resignation as Scottish Labour Party leader
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jim Murphy says he will stand down as leader in June Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is to resign next month, he has announced. Mr Murphy said he would tender his resignation alongside a plan to reform the party. He lost his seat in last week's general election as the SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats, leaving Labour with a single MP in Scotland. Mr Murphy said he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in next year's election. Instead, he said it was time to "do something else" and that he believed the party would continue to be divided if he remained as leader. His deputy, Kezia Dugdale MSP, will become acting leader until a permanent successor is found. 'Divide the party' Mr Murphy had faced calls to resign from several MSPs, trade unions and former MPs in the wake of his party's near wipeout at the general election. He insisted he had decided to stand down ahead of the national executive voting by 17-14 in favour of him staying in the job. Speaking at a media conference after the national executive meeting, he said: "It is clear that a small minority who didn't accept my election as leader of the Scottish Labour Party just five months ago won't accept the vote of the executive today and that will continue to divide the party. "Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago."

Citizenship of Australian terrorists overseas under question
Government promises laws to strip citizenship from dual-nationality terrorists within weeks, amid debate within Cabinet Updated The Federal Government will legislate "within weeks" to strip dual-nationality terrorists of their Australian citizenship, but the Prime Minister says Australia has "no intention" of applying similar moves to Australians with no other citizenship. The new laws will apply to dual-national Australian citizens who fight with or support terrorist groups at home or abroad. "As flagged by me in my national security statement in February, we will be legislating within a few weeks to strip dual citizens involved in terrorism of their Australian citizenship," Tony Abbott announced this afternoon. Under the proposal, the immigration minister will have the power to remove a dual-national's Australian citizenship but it will subject to judicial review and oversight from the Federal Court. "I want to stress we will be ensuring that as far as we can humanly make it, no-one becomes stateless, and any decision by the minister to strip someone of their citizenship, to strip a dual national of Australian citizenship, will be subject to due judicial review," Mr Abbott said. The ABC has confirmed there was a robust discussion in Cabinet over the proposal that an Australian citizen, who has no other citizenship, might have it withdrawn. Mr Abbott and Immigration Minister Peter Dutton were described as "gung ho" regarding the idea Mr Dutton be given the power to withdraw citizenship from someone "suspected" of being a terrorist. The concern expressed by several ministers was that the proposal did not have sufficient due process for withdrawing such a substantial right. Asked about the issue, Mr Abbott said he was "open to all mechanisms which are consistent with a free and fair and tolerant society that will help this Government to keep Australians as safe as we possibly can".

Chile knock out defending champions Uruguay from Copa America 2015
Chile have never won the Copa America tournament Hosts Chile moved into the Copa America semi-finals as Mauricio Isla's late winner knocked nine-man holders Uruguay out of the tournament. Chile dominated a bruising contest, Eduardo Vargas and Arturo Vidal both going close before Edinson Cavani was sent off for a second yellow card. Uruguay held out until the 82nd minute when Isla fired home from 16 yards. In the closing moments of an ugly game Uruguay defender Jorge Fucile was red-carded for a second caution. Juventus defender Mauricio Isla's goal was only his third for Chile Chile will now face the winners of Friday's match between Bolivia and Peru (00:30 BST) for a place in the final. Having been shown a yellow card for confronting a linesman, the 28-year-old Paris St-Germain forward was ordered off after TV pictures appeared to show Gonzalo Jara putting a hand on his buttocks. Defender Jara theatrically fell to the ground in response to a raised hand from Cavani, whose father was involved in a fatal car crash in Uruguay this week. The match was then halted for several minutes after Uruguay's players surrounded the referee and linesman, and officials and players from both sides scuffled on the field. Chile, who dominated the match with 80% possession, have never won the Copa America since its inception in 1916. Chile dominated possession throughout and had eight shots alone in the first half The game descended into a bad tempered affair with scuffles between both sets of players breaking out at regular intervals

US Supreme Court declares same-sex marriage legal
Facebook has launched a tool that lets users show their support of marriage equality. Facebook’s “Celebrate Pride” tool was announced by co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. The tool was launched shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is now considered a fundamental constitutional right guaranteed under the 14th Amendment. By visiting the “Celebrate Pride” tool on Facebook, you will see a preview of your profile picture with a rainbow filter. If you click “use as profile picture,” then your existing profile photo will be uploaded with the rainbow filter that is similar to Zuckerberg’s photo above. "I’m so happy for all of my friends and everyone in our community who can finally celebrate their love and be recognized as equal couples under the law," said Zuckerberg in a Facebook post. "We still have much more to do to achieve full equality for everyone in our community, but we are moving in the right direction." Facebook is not the only technology company that showed its support for marriage equality. Those companies insisted that the lack of federal recognition of same sex marriages negatively affects company morale and makes tax benefits complicated. Here is a tweet that Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote following the Supreme Court ruling: Today marks a victory for equality, perseverance and love.

'Terror' shooting wounds three on international train in Belgium
One serves in the Air Force, another recently served in Afghanistan in the National Guard, another is studying physical therapy in Sacramento — and all three Americans are being hailed as heroes for tackling and disarming a gunman they happened to encounter on a high-speed Amsterdam-Paris train. Air Force serviceman Spencer Stone remained hospitalized Saturday after being stabbed, though the Pentagon said the injury was not life-threatening. Another passenger was wounded by a handgun in the attack Friday night, according to a police union official. It's unclear whether there was a political motive to the gunman's actions. French authorities are questioning the attacker, identified by police as a 26-year-old of Moroccan origin, and are expected to speak to at least one of the Americans on Saturday about what happened. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, speaking in the northern French city of Arras where the train was diverted, said the Americans "were particularly courageous and showed great bravery in very difficult circumstances," and that "without their sangfroid we could have been confronted with a terrible drama." French authorities are on heightened alert after Islamic extremist attacks in January left 20 people dead, including the three gunmen. In June, a lone attacker claiming allegiance to Islamic radicals beheaded his employer and set off an explosion at an American-owned factory in France, raising concerns about other scattered, hard-to-predict attacks. Anthony Sadler, a senior at Sacramento State University, was traveling with childhood friends Stone, of Carmichael, California, and Alek Skarlatos, a National Guardsman from Roseburg, Oregon, when they heard a gunshot and breaking glass. Sadler told The Associated Press that they saw a train employee sprint down the aisle followed by a gunman with an automatic rifle. U.S. citizens called 'courageous' in French train shooting France's Interior Minister says the country's anti-terrorism prosecutor is investigating a shooting that left three people wounded on a train between Paris and Amsterdam, in which two U.S. citizens helped disarm the attacker.

IndyCar driver Justin Wilson dies aged 37
CORRECTION/CLARIFICATION: The sentence that begins, “Eight-time NHRA Top Fuel champion Tony Schumacher was the first driver to use a canopy…” was missing details. The sentence should have clarified that Schumacher was the first driver to use the canopy designed by Aerodine Composites Group that was approved by the NHRA in 2012. LONG POND, Pa. — The incident that left Justin Wilson in a coma brought a renewed push for canopies over the exposed cockpits of Indy cars. Minutes after Wilson was struck on the helmet by what appeared to be the nose cone of Sage Karam’s car during the late stages of Sunday’s Verizon IndyCar Series ABC Supply 500 at Pocono Raceway, Ryan Hunter-Reay addressed the subject in a subdued winner’s press conference. WILSON: In coma after Pocono crash “These cars are inherently dangerous with the open cockpit like that, head exposed,” Hunter-Reay said. We’ve seen some concept renderings of something that resemble a canopy — not a full jet fighter canopy, but something that can give us a little protection but keep the tradition of the sport.” Canopies — plastic enclosures over open cockpits — have been proposed before, most recently after a Formula 1 crash in October 2014 that left Jules Bianchi in a coma for nine months — he died in July — and after a piece of debris struck James Hinchcliffe’s helmet during the Indianapolis Grand Prix in May 2014. CANOPIES: Open-wheel racing series discussing options for use Wilson remained in a coma in critical condition at Lehigh Valley Health Network Cedar Crest Hospital in Allentown, Pa., with what IndyCar officials described as a severe head injury. Hunter-Reay said he was told Wilson was unconscious and not responding when rescue workers reached him immediately after the incident. “There’s nothing that I remember,” Hinchcliffe told USA TODAY Sports in October. The first thing I started talking about over the radio was wanting to get my helmet off, but I don’t remember that.” JAMES: Drivers try to cope with Wilson trauma The primary pushback against canopies is the possibility that movement and vision could be restricted.

Austrian police find dozens dead inside lorry
Up to 50 people, presumed to be asylum-seekers, have been found dead in the back of a lorry in Austria. Officials referred to the dead as migrants, and local media reports suggested they died of "suffocation" after being trapped in the lorry's trailer. A police manhunt has been launched to find the driver, who is suspected of smuggling the victims into the country. The bodies were found in the back of a refrigerated food delivery truck, which had been parked on the hard shoulder of the A4 road, Austria's "Eastern Motorway", near the town of Parndorf. A spokesperson for the Austrian interior ministry confirmed to the Reuters news agency that the tractor trailer had been found, but was unable to provide a definitive death toll. "Unfortunately there are many dead people in there," he said.

Cairo court retrial: Al Jazeera journalists sentenced to three years’ jail
Cairo (CNN) An Egyptian court on Saturday sentenced three Al Jazeera journalists to three years in prison after a lengthy retrial. Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were present for the proceedings, with the latter given an additional six months in prison and a fine of 5,000 Egyptian pounds ($640.) Australian Al Jazeera journalist Peter Greste, who was deported from Egypt in February 2015 , was sentenced in absentia. The journalists were charged with aiding a terrorist organization, a reference to the Muslim Brotherhood, which was outlawed in Egypt after the army overthrew President Mohamed Morsy amid mass protests against his rule in 2013. The court confirmed over 13 sessions that the defendants are not journalists and worked without a broadcast license, Judge Hassan Farid said. "They broadcast video footage that contained false news and aired it after editing it on Al Jazeera with the aim of harming the country," he said. JUST WATCHED Journalist Peter Greste: 'I can't go back' to Egypt Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Journalist Peter Greste: 'I can't go back' to Egypt 03:38 Al Jazeera Media Network's acting director general Mostefa Souag condemned the verdict, saying it "defies logic and common sense" and follows a heavily politicized and unfair trial process. It is a dark day for the Egyptian judiciary; rather than defend liberties and a free and fair media they have compromised their independence for political reasons." All three were convicted last year on charges that included conspiring with the Brotherhood, spreading false news and endangering national security, but they have maintained their innocence.

US adds 173,000 jobs in August; unemployment rate drops to seven year low
WASHINGTON - The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a seven-year low in August as employers added a modest 173,000 jobs, a key piece of evidence for the Federal Reserve in deciding whether to raise interest rates from record lows later this month. The Labor Department says the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent from 5.3 percent, the lowest since April 2008. Hiring in August was the lowest in five months, but the government revised up the June and July job growth by a combined 44,000. From June through August, the economy generated a solid 221,000 jobs a month, up from an average of 189,000 in March through May. Over the last twelve months, higher hourly earnings and a modest uptick in average hours worked pushed weekly earnings up by 2.5 percent. Recent data suggests that gains may be accelerating, which -- if sustained -- would be a positive development for workers," Jim Baird, partner and chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors, wrote in a note after the release. Steady hiring could encourage the Fed to raise rates for the first time in a decade. Still, stock market turbulence, a persistently low inflation rate and a sharp slowdown in China could complicate its decision. Still, after three years of solid job growth that has put nearly 8 million Americans back to work, Fed officials are probably satisfied with the job market's progress. Americans could face higher costs for mortgages and other loans, though the increases could be modest and gradual.

Civilian government restored as Burkina Faso coup ends
Image copyright AFP Image caption Interim President Michael Kafando attended the first post-coup cabinet meeting A unit of guards that carried out a coup in Burkina Faso last week before handing back power is to be disbanded. Interim President Michel Kafando was formally reinstated on Wednesday after an intervention from the army and several West African leaders. Coup leader Gen Gilbert Diendere admitted the putsch had been "the biggest mistake". "We knew the people were not in favour of it," he said. At least 10 people were killed and more than 100 injured in clashes during the take over. The decision to disband the presidential guard (RSP) was taken at the first full meeting of the government since Mr Kafando's reinstatement. They also dismissed the minister in charge of security and established a commission to identify those behind the coup. Prime Minister Yacouba Isaac Zida had warned that "those who will have to answer to justice will do so". The RSP - a unit of 1,200 well-armed and well-trained men - is loyal to Blaise Compaore, the country's long-time ruler who was ousted in a popular uprising last year. A week later, when it became clear they did not enjoy popular support and after a threat from the regular army to step down or be ousted by force, the RSP withdrew. If there is one thing that Burkina Faso has proved, it is that the country has an almost unlimited capacity to confound the predictions of even the most seasoned observers.

NASA announces water on Mars
Researchers say discovery of stains from summertime flows down cliffs and crater walls increases chance of finding life on red planet Liquid water runs down canyons and crater walls over the summer months on Mars, according to researchers who say the discovery raises the chances of being home to some form of life. The trickles leave long, dark stains on the Martian terrain that can reach hundreds of metres downhill in the warmer months, before they dry up in the autumn as surface temperatures drop. Images taken from the Mars orbit show cliffs, and the steep walls of valleys and craters, streaked with summertime flows that in the most active spots combine to form intricate fan-like patterns. Scientists are unsure where the water comes from, but it may rise up from underground ice or salty aquifers, or condense out of the thin Martian atmosphere. Mars find suggests our solar system is awash with life | Letters Read more “There is liquid water today on the surface of Mars,” Michael Meyer, the lead scientist on Nasa’s Mars exploration programme, told the Guardian. “Because of this, we suspect that it is at least possible to have a habitable environment today.” A visual guide to water on Mars Read more The water flows could point Nasa and other space agencies towards the most promising sites to find life on Mars, and to landing spots for future human missions where water can be collected from a natural supply. “Mars is not the dry, arid planet that we thought of in the past,” said Nasa’s Jim Green. “Liquid water has been found on Mars.” Some of the earliest missions to Mars revealed a planet with a watery past. Nearly a decade ago, Nasa’s Mars Global Surveyor took pictures of what appeared to be water bursting through a gully wall and flowing around boulders and other rocky debris.

The blaze took hold at the Colectiv club on Friday night, causing a stampede for the exit. Emergency response chief Raed Arafat said 155 people were being treated in hospitals in the Romanian capital. The fire is believed to have been caused by fireworks that were let off inside the club. "The only information we have is that fireworks were used in the club and after that the tragedy happened. Of course, this is under investigation," Mr Arafat told the BBC.

Volkswagen emissions scandal may affect thousands more cars
Image copyright Getty Images Shares in VW have dropped after it reported "irregularities" in carbon dioxide emissions levels, which could affect about 800,000 cars in Europe. An internal investigation by the firm into diesel emissions revealed that CO2 emissions and fuel consumption were understated during standards tests. VW said it concerned mainly diesel but also some petrol models and could affect VW, Skoda, Audi and Seat cars. It comes weeks after VW was accused of cheating nitrogen oxide level tests. Cars with 1.4, 1.6 and 2.0 litre motors are thought to be releasing more of the greenhouse gas, CO2, than previous tests had shown. VW has already put aside €6.7bn (£4.7bn) to meet the cost of recalling 11m diesel vehicles worldwide that were fitted with so called "defeat devices" that circumvented tests for emissions of nitrogen oxides. Image copyright Getty Images VW shares fall The scandal was revealed in September by US regulators who said the software detected when vehicles were undergoing emissions tests and changed the way they operated. On Monday US authorities also accused VW of fitting nitrogen oxide defeat devices on its larger 3.0 litre diesel engines used in luxury sport utility vehicles for Porsche, Audi and VW. VW has denied those particular charges made by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Porsche also denied the allegations but its North American division has announced it is discontinuing sales of Porsche Cayenne diesel sport utility vehicles until further notice. On the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, shares in VW were down by more than 4% in afternoon trading. Yesterday, it faced new accusations of distorted emissions tests from American regulators (which it rejects); today it announced its own investigations have uncovered "irregularities" in a completely different part of the testing and approval process.

Romanian Prime Minister resigns after nightclub fire
More than 30,000 people demonstrate in Bucharest and other cities to demand profound change to end corruption. Thousands of Romanians have taken to the streets of the capital for a second night to call for end to corruption despite the resignation of the country's prime minister. Prime Minister Victor Ponta quit earlier on Wednesday after mass protests triggered by a night club fire that killed 32 people. More than 30,000 people demonstrated in Bucharest and other major cities to demand a "profound change" in the government, AFP news agency reported. Wednesday's turnout was even bigger than one the previous evening when some 20,000 demonstrators massed in Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of government, calling for Ponta's resignation and that of his interior minister, Gabriel Oprea. Protesters said the government's resignation should be just the beginning of reforming a political class and public administration widely seen as corrupt. "We came here first of all to fight against corruption, people who are corrupt and the system which defends corrupt people. If in 1989 (anti-Communist revolution) people fought for liberty, in 2015 we are fighting for justice," said protester, Hans. "People want a change in the system, half measures will no longer work," Marius Matache, a musician taking part in the march, told AFP. Ponta, prime minister since 2012, had been under pressure to quit weeks before the blaze, after going on trial in September on charges of fraud, tax evasion and money laundering.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton NEW YORK A female officer in the Air Force, who was one of the first openly gay service members to get married, was identified on Tuesday as being among six U.S. troops killed by a suicide bomber near Bagram air base in Afghanistan. Air Force Major Adrianna Vorderbruggen is the first openly gay woman to be killed in action, the Daily Beast news website reported, citing a Department of Defense official. "We do find comfort in knowing that Heather and Jacob are no longer in the shadows and will be extended the rights and protections due any American military family as they move through this incredibly difficult period in their lives," said the posting from Military Partners and Families Coalition. Bagram, around 40 km (25 miles) north of Kabul, is one of the main bases for the remaining 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, after international troops ended combat operations last year. The victims included New York City Detective Joseph Lemm, a 15-year veteran of the NYPD who also volunteered in the U.S. Air National Guard and was on his third deployment to war zones. "Detective Joseph Lemm epitomized the selflessness we can only strive for: putting his country and city first," New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said in a statement. Local media in Statesboro, Georgia, identified a third victim as serviceman Chester McBride Jr., who was remembered by the principal of Statesboro High School as "a young man of high character with a great smile."

UK's Financial Conduct Authority drop inquiry into culture of banking
Image copyright Getty Images The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has shelved plans for an inquiry into the culture, pay and behaviour of staff in banking. The FCA had planned to look at whether pay, promotion or other incentives had contributed to scandals involving banks in the UK and abroad. The shadow chancellor said it was a "huge blow to customers and taxpayers". The Treasury denies involvement in the decision - which some commentators have suggested was politically motivated. The FCA said it had decided a "traditional thematic review" would not help it achieve its "desired outcomes", promising instead to encourage the "delivery of cultural change". Mark Garnier MP, a Conservative member of the Treasury Select Committee said he was "disappointed" by the decision. Banks around the world have faced huge fines from regulators for their involvement in numerous scandals. In May the news agency Reuters calculated that 20 global banks had paid £152bn in fines and compensation to customers since the 2008 financial crisis. 'Costly mistake' Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the decision by the FCA was "shocking" and could prove a "dangerous and costly mistake". He said: "This will be a huge blow to customers and taxpayers who are all still paying the price for the failed culture in the banking sector that's been widely attributed to be among the main causes of the crash and the scandals over Libor and price-fixing." Mr McDonnell added it was "worrying" that the FCA was replacing the review and replacing it with a "potentially watered-down version", when there could potentially still be "cultural mispractice" in banking. He said Chancellor George Osborne could not "stay silent on this issue" and called for him to use his influence to keep the review going. 'Shift in tone' The decision to drop the inquiry comes six months after FCA boss Martin Wheatley - who was originally hired because of his reputation as a tough regulator - was effectively sacked by Mr Osborne following two tumultuous years in the role. Many in the City had found Mr Wheatley's approach too combative and raised concerns about some of the language he used in reference to the banking industry.

US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies, aged 79
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has died at the age of 79, leaving the nation's highest court split between Republican and Democratic appointees, and sparking a partisan battle over whether President Barack Obama should nominate a replacement in a presidential election year. "On behalf of the Court and retired Justices, I am saddened to report that our colleague Justice Antonin Scalia has passed away," Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement late Saturday afternoon. "He was an extraordinary individual and jurist, admired and treasured by his colleagues. His passing is a great loss to the Court and the country he so loyally served. Story Continued Below The statement did not indicate the cause of death, but several news outlets reported that he died of natural causes while a guest at a resort in Marfa, Texas. Local media reported that Scalia attended a reception Friday night but did not appear for breakfast. Scalia, widely regarded as the intellectual leader of the court's conservative wing, was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to the Supreme Court in 1986. He went on to have one of the most noteworthy careers of any justice, speaking out forcefully from the bench and in speeches around the country for his belief that the Constitution must be interpreted based on the original intent of the framers. Obama, in an evening appearance, praised Scalia as one of the nation's most consequential jurists and said he shared the grief felt by Scalia's wife, Maureen, and their nine children and many grandchildren. He said that now is the time to mourn, but that he intended to fulfill his constitutional duty to nominate a replacement. But Obama is expected to face fierce — if not insurmountable — resistance in the Senate to any nominee that he might put forth, especially given the heightened political conversation around the presidential election.

Italian writer Umberto Eco dies, age 84
The revered literary critic, author and essayist – most famous for 1980 novel The Name of the Rose – had been suffering from cancer The celebrated Italian intellectual Umberto Eco, who shot to fame with his 1980 novel The Name of the Rose, has been remembered as a master of Italian culture after his death at the age of 84. Eco died on Friday night after suffering from cancer, prompting tributes to pour in for the esteemed writer. He was “an extraordinary example of a European intellectual, combining unique intelligence of the past with a limitless capacity to anticipate the future”, said Italy’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi. “It’s an enormous loss for culture, which will miss his writing and voice, his sharp and lively thought, and his humanity,” Renzi told the Ansa news agency. Italy’s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, said Eco remained youthful until his last day. Leading daily Corriere della Sera called Eco “the writer who changed Italian culture”, while newspaper La Stampa described a country in mourning for the author’s death. Through Eco’s academic writings and his bestselling books, he became a respected intellectual voice both in Italy and abroad. Internationally, he remains best known for his bestseller The Name of the Rose, a medieval detective novel set in an Italian abbey, which follows Brother William of Baskerville as he investigates a series of suspicious deaths. The work secured Eco’s international reputation and he went on to pen a number of other novels, including Foucault’s Pendulum in 1988. His most recent work, Numero Zero, was published last year and centres on a new newspaper in Milan funded by a meddling tycoon. “It’s only publishers and some journalists who believe that people want simple things.

No-one has admitted carrying out the attack, the latest in recent months. The Turkish government has blamed Kurdish militants for previous attacks and has retaliated against them. Saturday's attack on Istiklal Street in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, occurred at about 11:00 local time (09:00 GMT). Uwes Shehadeh was some 500m (1,640ft) away when he heard "a horrific and horrible noise". "People didn't know what was going on. Everyone was screaming and running away," he told the BBC. "Istanbul is on high alert and people are very worried as to what will happen next." Two Irish citizens and one person each from Germany, Iceland, Dubai and Iran were also injured.

Football legend Johan Cruyff dies at 68 due to cancer
Work on Barcelona’s new stadium is due to begin in two years with Nou Camp Nou the current working title. After the death of the most important figure in the club’s history on Thursday, already there were supporters calling for his name to be immortalised in the naming of the new ground. Estadi Johan Cruyff would be a fitting homage to the father of the modern Barça. When the Dutchman took over as manager in 1990, Barcelona had only ever won the Primera Division 10 times in its history and were six European Cups adrift of Real Madrid, having never lifted the biggest prize in club football. With Cruyff in charge they won the next four La Liga titles and beat Sampdoria at Wembley in 1992 to win their first European Cup. His team-talk ahead of that 1992 European Cup final win remains the unwritten first commandment at the football club – “Salid y disfrutad” (Go out and enjoy yourselves), he told his players. His successors in the technical area are spared much of existential style crisis of other managers at other clubs because at Barça there is only one way to play, one non-negotiable philosophy. Right from his first appearance in a 4-0 home win over Granada in 1973, in which he made the first goal and scored twice. “The thing about great teams,” he once said, defining his belief in always playing off the front foot, “is that they start games with the score at 0-0, thinking they have lost two points and they have to go looking for them.” He also said: “It’s braver to have a style and stick to it than to win a title.” Having a style and sticking to it – his style – has often been what has brought the club titles. He also gave them a dogged determination and a belief that they could take on the might of Europe that they lacked before he turned up with his three European Cup-winners’ medals from his days at Ajax.

Italian parliament votes to back same-sex civil unions
Politicians vote 369-193 in favour of vote of confidence in government over heavily disputed bill, heralding its final approval Italy’s parliament has backed the introduction of same-sex civil unions in a long-awaited decision that has been hailed as a civil rights landmark. Before the approval by MPs on Wednesday, Italy had been the last major western country not to legally recognise same-sex relationships. However, the legislation was criticised for not providing full equality for gay couples, particularly in terms of adoption rights. The bill was expected to be voted through later on Wednesday. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, called the confidence vote to prevent potential last-minute blocking or delaying amendments by opponents of the legislation, who include rebels in his Democratic party as well as the Catholic right. Before the vote, Renzi wrote on his Facebook page: “Today is a day of celebration for so many people. It was no longer acceptable to have any more delays after years of failed attempts.” The government used the same confidence vote tactic to ensure that the bill was approved by the senate of the republic, the upper house, in February, but only after the original text had been diluted in order to appease opponents threatening to scupper it altogether. A draft article that would have granted gay couples the right to adopt their partners’ biological children was dropped. While adoption has not been ruled out, family judges will decide on a case-by-case basis. Claudio Rossi Marcelli, a commentator for Internazionale magazine, who lives with his husband and children in Denmark, said: “For Italian homosexuals and all those who support civil rights, it’s a bittersweet victory.” Gabriele Piazzoni, the national secretary of equality organisation Arcigay, said in a statement: “The glass is half full. The text contains the recognition and protection many gays and lesbians have been waiting for all their lives ... [but] everything this law has failed to guarantee leaves a bitter taste.” Several previous attempts to legalise civil unions in Italy have foundered, often due to opposition orchestrated by the Catholic church.

At a news conference on Tuesday afternoon with Mr. Lavrov, Mr. Kerry rejected a suggestion that, in dealing with Mr. Assad, he was operating without the kind of leverage he had in Vienna last year during the Iran nuclear negotiations — when American sanctions and sabotage of the Iranian program created the pressure that led to a deal. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Mr. Kerry — who White House aides say has complained in Situation Room meetings about the lack of clout to force Mr. Assad to make good on his commitments — argued that the Syrian leader would be making a mistake to believe he would pay no price for refusing to cooperate. “If President Assad has come to a conclusion there’s no Plan B,” he said, referring to more coercive action to force him to comply, “then he’s come to a conclusion that is totally without any foundation whatsoever and even dangerous.” Mr. Kerry added later that Mr. Assad “should never make a miscalculation about President Obama’s determination to do what is right at any given moment of time, where he believes that he has to make that decision.” Mr. Assad, he said, has “flagrantly violated” the United Nations resolution calling for a nationwide cease-fire and allowing humanitarian assistance.

On the campaign trail in the USA, May 2016
Bernie Sanders is upset that a union representative he nominated for the platform drafting committee wasn't approved. | Getty Sanders accuses DNC of keeping labor union representation off platform committee Sen. Bernie Sanders lobbed another shot at the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday, charging that chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is keeping labor union members off the DNC's platform drafting committee. "What we heard from the DNC was they did not want representatives of labor unions on the platform drafting committee. To the best of my knowledge," Sanders said in Spreckels, California, during a news conference on fracking. The drafting committee, however, does have labor representation. Paul Booth of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union was on the list of names Hillary Clinton's campaign submitted and the DNC approved. But another union representative — RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, the largest union of nurses in the country, which supports Sanders — was submitted by the Sanders camp to be included on the committee, but Wasserman Schultz didn’t approve her for the panel. DeMoro said Sanders called her personally to ask if he could nominate her to the powerful committee. “Bernie called me and told me that he needed somebody who was a very strong voice for Medicare for all and labor on the DNC [drafting committee] and he thought I would be very vocal,” DeMoro told POLITICO. "Bernie told me it was very important to him that I would agree to do this.” DeMoro agreed to be nominated and said she didn't hear anything until the DNC publicly announced its names for the platform committee, which didn't include her. She said she was intentionally kept off the committee by the DNC. “I was not surprised whatsoever that Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton would keep me off the drafting committee because not only would we have participated, we would have fought for our positions.” A DNC convention official stressed that labor would be represented at the convention. "Labor is an historic bedrock of the Democratic party and we are thrilled to have many labor leaders on the platform committee as well as a labor policy representative on the drafting committee," DNC spokeswoman April Mellody said in a statement.

Suicide bombers attack Istanbul's Ataturk airport
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan says attack in which 42 died should be turning point in global fight against terrorism Turkey has declared a day of national mourning after more than 40 people were killed in suicide attacks on Istanbul’s main airport, the deadliest and most high-profile in a string of killings and explosions that have shaken the country this year. The violence has crippled Turkey’s tourism industry and threatens its ambitions as a global hub, as the violence in neighbouring Syria increasingly spills over into a country that once promoted itself as a stable base in a restive region. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan blamed Islamic State for the late-night attack on one of the busiest air travel hubs in the world, and called on the international community to make the attack a turning point in the global fight against terrorism. At least three people with guns and suicide vests targeted the arrivals and departures areas, where they sprayed travellers with bullets and then detonated their explosives in a rampage that lasted just a few minutes but killed dozens and injured more than 250 others. The official death toll rose to 42 on Wednesday night, according to the Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu, which reported that an injured woman had died in hospital. Police sources quoted in the Turkish media said the attackers had rented a flat in the Aksaray area of Istanbul and taken a taxi at 8.45pm local time to Atatürk airport. The driver described the attackers as calm and not at all stressed. “When the terrorists couldn’t pass the regular security system, when they couldn’t pass the scanners, police and security controls, they returned and took their weapons out of their suitcases and opened fire at random at the security check,” said prime minister Binali Yildirim. Two Turkish officials told Associated Press that one of the three attackers entered the lower-level arrivals hall, opened fire, and then detonated his explosive. The third man waited outside and detonated his explosives as terrified passengers flooded out of the airport, the officials said.

Holocaust survivor and Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel dies aged 87
(CNN) Elie Wiesel , a Holocaust survivor and author who fought for peace, human rights and simple human decency, has died at the age of 87, a spokesman for Israel's Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, said Saturday. His family said he died peacefully Saturday after a long illness. "My husband was a fighter. He fought for the memory of the 6 million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, and he fought for Israel. He waged countless battles for innocent victims regardless of ethnicity or creed," his widow, Marion, said in a statement released by the writer's foundation. Wiesel, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, recounted his family being sent to the Nazi concentration camps in his first book, "Night," which was published in France in 1958. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lauded Wiesel as a "master of words." In the darkness of the Holocaust in which our brothers and sisters -- 6 million -- were murdered, Elie Wiesel was a ray of light and greatness of humanity who believed in the good in man," Netanyahu said. "I was privileged to know Elie and to learn so much from him." The future writer was later moved and ultimately freed from the Buchenwald camp in 1945. Of his relatives, only two of his sisters survived. Wiesel told CNN last year that Auschwitz was "to this day, a source of shock and astonishment." Wiesel survived because an older Jew told him to tell the Nazis he was 18, old enough to work.

Key points: Permanent Court of Arbitration found China breached Philippines' sovereign rights by claiming South China Sea Labor's Stephen Conroy describes China's actions as "aggressive and at-times bullying" Senator Conroy also pushed for Australia to carry out Freedom of Navigation operations Overnight an international court in The Hague ruled China has no historic title over the waters of the South China Sea, in a non-enforceable ruling dismissed as a "farce" by the government in Beijing. "China's been engaged in an aggressive and at-times bullying performance, and has now been called out by the international court," Senator Conroy told Radio National this morning. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has warned China that it must heed the ruling handed down in The Hague, saying that "to ignore it would be serious international transgression, there would be strong reputational costs". She said Australia would continue to exercise its right to Freedom of Navigation in the region, but would not confirm whether Australia would conduct patrols within 12 nautical miles of China's artificial islands. "Australia will continue to exercise our international law rights to Freedom of Navigation and overflight, and support the right of others to do so," she said. A principle of customary international law that allows any sovereign state to challenge territorial claims on the world's oceans and airspace The US Freedom of Navigation (FON) program has been running since 1979, including operations in the South China Sea Australia has been urged to run its own FON operations within 12 nautical miles of China's artificial islands in the area But Senator Conroy said he had personally questioned Defence officials through the Senate estimates process and they had made it clear they were not authorised to engage in Freedom of Navigation exercises. "The Government is continuing to pretend to the Australian people that it has an ongoing program of what is referred to as Freedom of Navigation operations in and around the South China Sea," he said. "Australia should authorise its forces to both sail and fly over the areas of the South China Sea." Professor Rothwell said the Chinese Government's reaction to last night's non-binding ruling had been "fierce", but said it was difficult to anticipate what action it would take in the longer term.

British rail minister Claire Perry steps down
Image copyright PA The government's rail minister has resigned - just after telling MPs she did not believe quitting would help resolve problems with train services in London and south-east England. The Department for Transport confirmed Claire Perry had quit, but did not give reasons for her departure. On Wednesday she said the chaos on Southern routes "feels like a failure". There has been mounting anger from commuters after repeated cancellations and late-running services. Passengers have held protests as services have been hit by industrial action and high levels of staff sickness, while the company has attempted to ease the problem by cutting 341 trains a day. She said: "At the moment I do not have the levers to pull to take the franchise back. I don't like failure, I don't fail at stuff in my life, this feels like a failure." Claire Perry stands down after a week in which she said she was ‘often ashamed to be the rail minister’ The rail minister Claire Perry, who has been the public face of the government during the outcry over Southern railway’s failures, has resigned.

ARM to be bought by SoftBank
The chief executive of SoftBank has said his £24.3bn takeover of ARM Holdings is a “big bet” on the UK thriving outside of the EU, as he pledged to put Britain’s biggest technology company at the centre of the next computing age. Masayoshi Son denied that the Japanese acquisition of the Cambridge based microchip designer had been an opportunistic swoop enabled by the falling pound, as he pledged to hire thousands of engineers in the UK. ARM, which designs the microchips used in the iPhone as well as in millions of other smartphones, tablets and other computer electronics, announced on Monday morning that it had agreed to the shock £17-a-share takeover, which will be put to investors in the coming months. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Softbank chief executive Masayoshi Son says the ARM purchase is a long-term investment UK technology firm ARM Holdings is to be bought by Japan's Softbank for £24bn ($32bn) it confirmed on Monday. The board of ARM is expected to recommend shareholders accept the offer - which is around a 43% premium on its closing market value of £16.8bn on Friday. The Cambridge-based firm designs microchips used in most smartphones, including Apple's and Samsung's. ARM, which was founded in 1990, employs more than 3,000 people. Shares in the UK technology firm surged by 45% at the open of the London Stock Exchange to 1,742.85p per share, adding £7.56bn to ARM's market value. Japanese entrepreneur ARM said it would keep its headquarters in Cambridge and that it would at least double the number of its staff over the next five years. The new deal will be funded by Softbank's own cash reserves and a long term loan from Japan's Mizuho Bank. Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent: Image copyright Getty Images It's hard to exaggerate just how important ARM is to the UK tech sector - and the shock many are feeling this morning at the news that it is about to lose its independence.

Jeff Overs/Courtesy of the BBC/Handout via REUTERS LONDON The race for control of Britain's Labour Party narrowed on Tuesday as lawmaker Angela Eagle withdrew, leaving incumbent Jeremy Corbyn up against a challenger promising a second Brexit referendum. Labour's left wing and its more moderate factions have been locked in a power struggle ever since Britain voted to leave the European Union on June 23, with critics saying Corbyn had not worked hard enough to prevent the Leave camp's victory. Eagle, formerly the party's top business spokesperson, withdrew from the leadership contest after private tallies showed she had received less support than rival Owen Smith at the halfway stage in the nominating process. "It is in the best interests of the Labour Party that we now come together so we can have one candidate," she told reporters. That leaves Corbyn, who has lost the support of most elected Labour members of parliament but remains popular with activists, up against Smith, his former work and pensions policy chief. Corbyn's rivals are concerned his left-wing agenda cannot win a national election and his style will not give Labour a strong enough voice in Britain's upcoming Brexit negotiations.

United States launch air strikes against Islamic State in Libya
The US military launched the first of what is expected to be a sustained series of air strikes in Libya targeting Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's stronghold of Sirte. Strikes were authorised by President Barack Obama after being requested by the United Nations-backed government in Libya. The last US bombing in Libya was in February and the intervention marked its first to support Libyan forces in their battle against Isil in Sirte. It was likely to mark the start of a more intense US involvement in Libya, opening a new and more persistent front against Isil. Isil seized Sirte last year, making it their most important base outside Syria and Iraq, but they are now besieged in a few square miles in the centre. They hold several strategically important sites including the university, the main hospital and the Ouagadougou conference hall, where they are believed to have stockpiled large amounts of ammunition. A Pentagon spokesman said the Isil vehicles were targeted with "precision strikes" and there would be more to come. He said no ground troops would be deployed. The spokesman said: "Additional US strikes will continue to target Isil in Sirte to enable the Government of National Accord to make a decisive, strategic advance." Fayez Seraj, the prime minister, speaking on Libyan television, said: "The first air strikes were carried out at specific locations in Sirte today causing severe losses to enemy ranks."

Paralympics bans Russian athletes from Rio Games after doping scandal
Rio will host the 15th edition of the summer Paralympic Games Russian athletes have been banned from competing at the Rio 2016 Paralympics following the country's doping scandal. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) had opened suspension proceedings following the McLaren report, and has now confirmed the ban. That report, published last month, detailed a state-sponsored doping programme operated by Russia. The Russian Paralympic Committee is to appeal against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In contrast to the IPC, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) chose not to hand Russia a blanket ban from the Olympic Games. The Rio 2016 Paralympics begin in 31 days' time, on 7 September, and 267 Russian athletes across 18 sports will now miss the Games. "The anti-doping system in Russia is broken, corrupted and entirely compromised," said IPC president Sir Philip Craven at a news conference on Sunday. "The Russian Paralympic Committee are unable to ensure compliance with and enforcement of the IPC anti-doping code and the world anti-doping code within their own national jurisdiction and they can not fulfil its fundamental obligation as an IPC member. "As a result, the Russian Paralympic Committee is suspended with immediate effect." Russian Paralympic Committee member Evgeniy Bukharov told BBC World Service: "I'm disappointed and really shocked. The IOC decided to stay for the rights of the clean athletes and only to fight against the athletes who are involved in doping. Craven's damning words "Tragically this situation is not about athletes cheating a system, but about a state-run system that is cheating the athletes.

Labour Party UK members win right to vote in leadership contest
Image copyright PA Image caption The leadership contest is a two-way fight between Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith Labour is challenging a High Court ruling giving recent members a vote in its leadership contest, with the appeal hearing expected on Thursday. The party lost a legal challenge to its rules banning anyone who joined as a member after 12 January from taking part unless they paid an extra £25. The party said it would defend the right of its governing NEC "to uphold the rule book". The court's decision, handed down on Monday, could add between 126,592 and 150,000 people to the list of those eligible to vote in the contest - according to different estimates. The ruling is thought likely to benefit leader Jeremy Corbyn over challenger Owen Smith, who earlier branded Mr Corbyn "useless" and said he had "fractured" the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn, speaking in Bristol, where he is attending a campaign rally, said: "The judge seemed very clear that his decision was all members of the party should have a right to vote in the leadership contest. A Labour spokesman said: "The Procedures Committee of the NEC has decided that the Labour Party will appeal [against] this ruling in order to defend the NEC's right, as Labour's governing body, to uphold the rule book, including the use of freeze dates." Mr Smith is calling for the leadership contest - due to end on 24 September - to be extended "so that all members have the opportunity to engage with Jeremy and me before making their choice".

Mr Smith said it was up to the NEC to decide whether to appeal and it was not right for Mr McDonnell, or himself, to "interfere" in its decisions. But he added: "Whatever the rules are I am just going to play by them and continue to make my case and at the end of this I am confident that I can persuade the Labour Party that I am the right man to lead us."

 Donald Trump doesn’t seem too keen on his three upcoming debates against Hillary Clinton. (AFP PHOTO/Getty Images) Donald Trump complained Friday that Hillary Clinton and her fellow Democrats were rigging this fall’s presidential debates by scheduling them alongside NFL games. That claim was easy to disprove — the debate schedule was determined almost a year ago by a private group made up of both Democrats and Republicans. On Saturday, Trump doubled down on his grievance. In an interview with ABC’s “This Week,” the GOP presidential hopeful said the NFL voiced its dismay about the conflicting primetime slots in a letter to Trump. “I’ll tell you what I don’t like,” Trump told George Stephanopoulos. '” Just one problem with that: The NFL says it never sent him a letter. CNN’s Brian Stelter approached the league about the matter and got this response: Top @NFL spokesman tells me: "While we'd obviously wish the debate commission could find another night, we did not send a letter to Trump." — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) July 30, 2016 The Republican nominee, in a tweet Friday night, complained that the first two debates — slated for Sept. 26 and Oct. 9, a Monday and a Sunday, respectively — fell into the same time slots as primetime football.

Ukrainian troops on Crimean border on high alert after rising tension with Russia
Russia and Ukraine stepped up security on the de facto border between Crimea and mainland Ukraine on Thursday, a day after Moscow accused Kiev of planning terror attacks on the peninsula. The alleged incidents, which have raised tensions over Crimea to the highest level since Russia annexed the region from Ukraine in 2014, took place over the weekend. Russia’s FSB security service claims to have detained a Ukrainian terror cell with 20 homemade explosive devices inside Crimea, and repelled fire from across the border in a separate incident. The FSB said one of its officers and a Russian soldier died during the clashes. “We obviously will not let such things slide by,” Putin said. On Thursday, Putin met his security council, and the group discussed “additional measures for ensuring security for citizens and essential infrastructure in Crimea”, according to a Kremlin statement. The statement added: “Scenarios were carefully considered for anti-terrorist security measures at the land border, in the waters and in the airspace of Crimea.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, at his security council meeting in the Kremlin, Moscow, on Thursday.

The US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, wrote on Twitter: “Russia has a record of frequently levying false accusations at Ukraine to deflect attention from its own illegal actions.” Russia seized Crimea in 2014, after the Maidan revolution in Kiev led to the country’s then president, Viktor Yanukovych, fleeing. The annexation, carried out by Russian soldiers wearing unmarked uniforms, led to western sanctions against Russia. Further sanctions were later introduced over Russian support for rebels in east Ukraine.

California releases search warrant for Wells Fargo bank on identity theft
WASHINGTON The California Attorney General's Office has launched a criminal investigation into Wells Fargo (WFC.N) over allegations it opened millions of unauthorized customer accounts and credit cards, according to a seizure warrant seen by Reuters. Attorney General Kamala Harris authorized a seizure warrant against the bank that seeks customer records and other documents, saying there is probable cause to believe the bank committed felonies. The probe marks the latest setback for the bank in a growing scandal that led to the abrupt retirement of its chief executive officer, monetary penalties, compensation clawbacks, lost business and damage to its reputation. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk did not immediately provide a comment in response to requests from Reuters, but was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying the bank is "cooperating in providing the requested information." A spokeswoman for the California Department of Justice said she could not comment on the probe. The bank's downward spiral kicked into high gear last month. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators ordered the United States' third-largest bank by assets to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle civil charges that its branch staff created as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge in order to meet internal sales targets. The CFPB said that high pressure sales tactics and financial incentives fueled the fraud, which was largely carried out by low-level branch employees. Observers have widely criticized his performance, with many saying he appeared ill-prepared to deal with tough questioning by lawmakers including Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called for his resignation and accused him of him "gutless" leadership. In September a source told Reuters that federal prosecutors are also looking into the matter. An affidavit filed by Special Agent Supervisor James Hirt with the California Department of Justice reveals that interviews with possible victims of the fraud have already started.

Judge jails 'monstrous' London serial killer Stephen Port
Judge says he accepts intention of chef, who murdered four men, was to cause serious harm rather than death The serial killer Stephen Port has been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison for the murder of four young gay men he drugged and raped before dumping their bodies near his east London flat. The 41-year-old chef, who had a fetish for sex with unconscious boyish-looking men, was convicted on Wednesday of the murders of Anthony Walgate, a 23-year-old fashion student from Hull, Gabriel Kovari, 22, originally from Slovakia, Daniel Whitworth, 21, a chef from Kent, and Jack Taylor, 25, a forklift driver from Dagenham. Sentencing Port to a whole-life order, Mr Justice Openshaw said: “I accept his intention was only to cause really serious harm rather than cause death but he must have known and foreseen there was a high risk of death, the more so after the death of Anthony Walgate, the first victim.”  He said: “The murders were committed as part of a persistent course of conduct of the defendant surreptitiously drugging these young men so that he could penetrate them while they were unconscious. “A significant degree of planning went into obtaining the drugs in advance and in luring the victims to his flat. Having killed them by administering an overdose, he dragged them out into the street in one case, or took them to the churchyard in the other cases, and abandoned their bodies in a manner which robbed them of their dignity, and thereby greatly increased the distress of their loving families.” The judge said: “I have no doubt that the seriousness of the offending is so exceptionally high that the whole-life order is justified; indeed it is required. The sentence therefore upon the counts of murder is a sentence of life imprisonment. The result is a whole-life sentence and the defendant will die in prison.” There were loud cheers and applause from family members in court, while someone in the public gallery shouted out: “I hope you die a long, slow death, you piece of shit.” DCI Tim Duffield, senior investigating officer from the Met’s homicide and major crime command, said: “These evil crimes have left entire families, a community and a nation in shock.” He said Port was one of the most dangerous individuals he had encountered in almost 28 years of policing and that a full-life term in prison was the only appropriate punishment in the circumstances. Outside court, Taylor’s sister Donna said: “We finally have justice for Jack and the other boys. Port was convicted of 22 offences against 11 men, including drugging and sex offences against seven men who survived their encounters with him. Despite striking similarities between the four murders, which were carried out over 15 months, the Metropolitan police failed to link them until the family of Taylor, his final victim, forced them to re-examine all the deaths.

On the campaign trail in the USA, October 2016
(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images) In a normal election, the past four days for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign would be somewhere between “really, really bad” and “just plain disastrous.” On Monday — 15 days before the election — came the news that the average premium for those on the federal market in Obamacare would rise 25 percent in 2017 and that 1 in 5 people in the federal marketplace would have only one option to “choose” from in terms of coverage plans. For a candidate like Clinton, who has linked much of her candidacy to the policies of the Obama administration, that's a very bad thing. On Thursday — just 12 days before the election — the WikiLeaks hack of top Clinton aides' emails produced a 13-page memo from Doug Band, a close adviser to former president Bill Clinton, that outlines — in no uncertain terms — how Band used the former president's stature (and the chance to spend time with him) to leverage donations to the Clinton Foundation. Write WaPo's Roz Helderman and Tom Hamburger: Band detailed a circle of enrichment in which he raised money for the Clinton Foundation from top-tier corporations such as Dow Chemical and Coca-Cola that were clients of his firm, Teneo, while pressing many of those same donors to provide personal income to the former president. The memo, made public Wednesday by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, lays out the aggressive strategy behind lining up the consulting contracts and paid speaking engagements for Bill Clinton that added tens of millions of dollars to the family’s fortune, including during the years that Hillary Clinton led the State Department. It describes how Band helped run what he called “Bill Clinton Inc.,” obtaining “in-kind services for the President and his family — for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like.” That. It looks and feels like trading access to the former president for donations to the Clinton Foundation. Which isn't illegal but sure suggests that the hard line the Clinton campaign has tried to draw between the Clinton Foundation and the Clintons is much more like a semipermeable membrane. A memo written by a former top aide to Bill Clinton in 2011 shows how the same organizations donating to the Clinton charity were also paying him speaking fees. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) The story is bad not only because it, well, looks bad but also because it reinforces so many of the negative things that the average person already thinks about the Clintons.

Gambian President Yahya Jammeh concedes electoral defeat

Yahya Jammeh, an authoritarian president who ruled for 22 years, has confirmed he will step down. "I will help him work towards the transition," Mr Jammeh said on state TV on Friday evening, after speaking to the president-elect by telephone. Mr Barrow, 51, who has never held political office, won Thursday's election with 45.5% of the vote. Hundreds of Gambians took to the streets to celebrate one of the biggest election upsets West Africa has ever seen. Mr Jammeh, also 51, took power in a bloodless coup in 1994 and has ruled the country with an iron fist ever since. President Jammeh took 36.7% of the vote, while a third party candidate, Mama Kandeh, won just 17.8%. President Jammeh has congratulated the property developer and vowed not to contest the results after deciding "that I should take the backseat". I'm excited that we win (sic) this election and from now hope starts," Mr Barrow told the BBC's Umaru Fofana, adding that he was disappointed not to have won by a larger margin. Born in 1965 near the eastern market town of Basse, Mr Barrow moved to London in the 2000s where he reportedly used to work as a security guard at an Argos catalogue store. He returned to The Gambia in 2006 to set up his own property company, which he still runs today. Mr Barrow, who is leading an opposition coalition of seven parties, has promised to revive the country's struggling economy, look at imposing a two-term presidential limit and introduce a three-year transitional government.

Plane carrying 92 crashes into Black Sea near Sochi
Kremlin says technical malfunction is likely cause of crash into Black Sea of Tu-154 carrying choir, with no survivors Vladimir Putin has ordered an investigation after a Russian military plane carrying 92 people, including dozens of Red Army choristers, crashed into the Black Sea on its way to Syria. The Tupolev Tu-154 plane was carrying musicians from the famous Alexandrov military choir, as well as dancers, musicians and journalists, to a new year concert for troops in Syria. In a statement, the Kremlin said that Putin expressed his “deepest condolences to the families and friends of those killed in the crash”. He also ordered the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, to form a state commission to investigate the crash. Russian agencies said all possible reasons for the crash were being examined, but investigators believed terrorism was unlikely. Russia’s RIA news agency, citing an unidentified security source, said preliminary data indicated the plane had crashed because of a technical malfunction, Reuters reported. A total of 84 passengers and eight crew were on board when the plane dropped off radar shortly after take-off at 5.40am local time (0240 GMT) from Adler airport in Sochi, southern Russia.

Actress and singer Debbie Reynolds dies, one day after daughter's death
Debbie Reynolds’ life was the stuff of movie legend, from her start as an ingenue playing opposite Gene Kelly in the classic 1952 musical “Singin’ in the Rain,” to her part in one of Hollywood’s most notorious scandals. And her death Wednesday at the age of 84 had the kind of tragic story line Hollywood made famous, coming only one day after her daughter, Carrie Fisher, died at the age of 60. Reynolds’ son, Todd, told media outlets that his mother was under stress over the death of her daughter and suffered a stroke at her home at about noon. Reynolds told him she missed her daughter and wanted to be with her. Fisher, a well-known actress and author in her own right, died four days after suffering a cardiac incident on a flight from London back to Los Angeles. "Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter," she wrote. Love Carries Mother.” Reynolds’ singing and dancing in “Singin’ in the Rain” and other musicals and frothy entertainment turned her into America’s Sweetheart and a potent box office star for years. And like the stalwart heroines she played, Reynolds never quit. From 1950 to 1967, she appeared in more than 30 movie musicals and light comedies, receiving her lone Oscar nomination for playing the title character in 1964’s “The Unsinkable Molly Brown.” Many critics considered it her most memorable early role, and it was a favorite — Reynolds related to a woman with tremendous zest for life. Off-screen, she starred in the real-life role of the wronged woman in a love triangle that many in the late 1950s considered at the time the Hollywood scandal of the century.

"Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!" Obama on Thursday ordered the expulsion of the Russians and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over their involvement in hacking political groups in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. "We will not expel anyone," Putin said in a statement, adding that Russia reserved the right to retaliate. "Further steps towards the restoration of Russian-American relations will be built on the basis of the policy which the administration of President D. Trump will carry out," he said. In a separate development, a code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by the Obama administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont electric utility, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing unnamed U.S. officials. The Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations of the utility, the officials told the Post, but penetration of the nation's electrical grid is significant because it represents a potentially serious vulnerability. Trump has repeatedly praised Putin and nominated people seen as friendly toward Moscow to senior administration posts, but it is unclear whether he would seek to roll back Obama's actions, which mark a post-Cold War low in U.S.-Russian ties.

U.S. President Obama's farewell address focuses on accomplishment
Barack Obama rose to power as the country's first African American president with message of hope and boundless optimism for the future. "If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible...who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer," he told crowds in Chicago in 2008 after winning the election. In all the years since he never wavered from his mission to help foster in America what he once called the "renewal of morality". Unlike Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton and so many others before him, this is a president unblemished by scandal. The president acted presidential even behind closed doors: even his closest aides fail to recall moments when Mr Obama gave way to roiling anger. Emotions have rarely muddled the academic rigor of his mind. White House staffers have nicknamed him the 'Colombo president', after the famous television detective who always catches the killer with his questions.

At least 26 killed in another Brazil prison riot
Brazil's President Michel Temer, gestures during an interview with Reuters at his office in Brasilia, Brazil, January 16, 2017. REUTERS/Adriano Machado BRASILIA Brazil aims to build nearly 30 prisons over the next year to ease chronic overcrowding in its penitentiary system as part of a package of emergency measures to tackle a wave of deadly prison riots, President Michel Temer said on Monday. In an interview with Reuters, Temer said Brazil's federal government would build five maximum security prisons to house the most violent convicts, often members of rival drug gangs whose turf war has plunged the prison system into crisis over the past two weeks. At least 140 inmates have been killed since the start of the year in riots at poorly staffed prisons run by cash-strapped state governments. Many of those killed had their heads cut off and were badly mutilated or burned. Brazil's penitentiary system, the fourth largest in the world, is home to more than 620,000 convicts and is running more than 50 percent over capacity. "We want to expedite the construction of these prisons because it would take two or three years using traditional methods," Temer told Reuters. "By using pre-fabricated buildings - which has already been done in Espirito Santo state - perhaps we can build all of these prisons in one year." Brazil's prisons are largely controlled by gangs, with drugs, guns and all manner of contraband entering regularly, authorities acknowledge. This year's intense violence is the result of a split between Brazil's most powerful drug gang, the First Capital Command (PCC), and its main rival, the Red Command. For more than two decades the two gangs maintained an uneasy working relationship, ensuring that a steady flow of drugs and arms easily made its way over Brazil's porous borders with the world's biggest cocaine-producing nations.

Obama commutes whistleblower's sentence: Chelsea Manning to walk free in 120 days
The whistleblower, who has been imprisoned for six years for leaking state secrets, is now set to go free on 17 May Chelsea Manning, the US army soldier who became one of the most prominent whistleblowers of modern times when she exposed the nature of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan, and who then went on to pay the price with a 35-year military prison sentence, is to be freed in May as a gift of Barack Obama in his final days as president. In the most audacious – and contentious – commutation decision to come from Obama yet, the sitting president used his constitutional power just three days before he leaves the White House to give Manning her freedom. Manning, a transgender woman, will walk from a male military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, on 17 May, almost seven years to the day since she was arrested at a base outside Baghdad for offences relating to the leaking of a vast treasure trove of US state secrets to the website WikiLeaks. | Chelsea Manning Read more Nancy Hollander, Manning’s lawyer, spoke to the Guardian before she had even had the chance to pass on to the soldier the news of her release. “Oh my God!” was Hollander’s instant response to the news which she had just heard from the White House counsel. “I cannot believe it – in 120 days she will be free and it will all be over. It’s incredible.”  Manning, 29, is a former intelligence analyst in Iraq who was sentenced in 2013 after a military court convicted her of passing more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to WikiLeaks. On a call with reporters, a White House official said repeatedly that the president believed Manning’s crimes were “serious” and “harmful to national security” but refused to label her a “traitor”. Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said: “Chelsea Manning exposed serious abuses, and as a result her own human rights have been violated by the US government for years.

Women's March becomes largest protest in U.S. history
The Women's Marches which took place across the United States to protest Donald Trump's inauguration may have been the largest – and most peaceful – day of protest in US history. Somewhere between 3.3 million and 4.6 million marchers made their presence known across the United States, yet no arrests were reported at the largest protests across the nation in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., New York, Chicago or Seattle. That's according to political scientists from the Universities of Connecticut and Denver, who are compiling a mammoth spreadsheet listing march turnouts from the roughly half a million that demonstrated in Washington to the single protester who picketed Show Low, Arizona. The largest single demo was in Los Angeles, where as many as 750,000 women thronged the streets. Meanwhile, sister protests across the globe attracted nearly 300,000 more attendees. Here's how the Women's March compares to some of history's largest protests (some in one city, some in thousands: some in Washington, some worldwide: some peaceful, some not): Estimating crowd size is always difficult: where several different figures are available, the chart above takes an average. Their released figure of 400,000 was far lower than Farrakhan and other organisers had hoped for, and lower than the eventual total of around 837,000 arrived at by independent researchers. It was seen as an attempt to censor the impact of the march, and lead to a bitter row which overshadowed the demo itself. Iraq War protests in 2003 hold the record for the largest demonstration both in a single city and across the globe: 3,000,000 are said to have marched in Rome, which has also been a flashpoint for labour demonstrations on a similar scale.

Anti-abortion March for Life draws thousands in Washington, D.C.
Abortion opponents met Friday for their 44th annual march in Washington with reasons for buoyant optimism: Republican control on Capitol Hill and a newly inaugurated president who appears intent on proving his later-in-life embrace of their cause. On Monday, President Trump reinstated a ban on funding international organizations that provide abortion services or related counseling, reversing President Obama’s action eight years earlier. Next Thursday, he is expected to announce an anti-abortion jurist to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. “I’m very optimistic that things are going to go well for the pro-life movement and unborn children,” said Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee. “I think this has been a fantastic first week for the administration.” Vice President Mike Pence, who on Friday became the highest-ranking elected official ever to appear at the march, told tens of thousands gathered near the Washington Monument that the administration will push for a permanent ban on taxpayer money for organizations involved in abortion. Thousands of marchers carried signs demanding that Planned Parenthood be stripped of federal funds, although under current law it is not allowed to use federal money for abortion services. “Life is winning in America, and today is a celebration of that progress,” Pence said. “The truth is being told, compassion is overcoming convenience and hope is defeating despair. In a word, life is winning in America because of all of you.” As with many other issues, Trump’s election upended expectations, turning what anti-abortion advocates feared would have been another term in the wilderness under Hillary Clinton into a new opportunity. ... We have to be prepared for the fact that they’ve got all the pieces in place to do real damage.” Trump makes for an odd savior for abortion opponents, given that in 1999 he described himself in a television interview as “very pro-choice” despite hating abortion. As late as 2000 he reiterated that position, but by 2011 was describing himself as opposing abortion except in cases of rape, incest or threat to the life of the woman.

Travel to U.S. resumes after federal judge blocks executive order
The legal maneuvering led Mr. Trump to lash out at Judge James Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle throughout the day, prompting criticism that the president had failed to respect the judicial branch and its power to check on his authority. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a Twitter post on Saturday, Mr. Trump wrote, “The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!” The Justice Department’s filing sought to have the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit block the Seattle judge’s decision and asked that the lower court’s ruling be stayed pending the appeal. Video In its argument for an appeal, the Justice Department had said the president had an “unreviewable authority” to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners. It said the ruling by Judge Robart was too broad, “untethered” to the claims of the State of Washington, and in conflict with a ruling by another federal district judge, in Boston, who had upheld the order. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Ninth Circuit court moved quickly to reject the administration’s appeal, a measure of the urgency and intense interest in the case. Blocking the order, it concluded, “immediately harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the President, based on his national security judgment.” Judge Robart, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, declared in his ruling on Friday that “there’s no support” for the administration’s argument that “we have to protect the U.S. from individuals” from the affected countries. Video His ruling also barred the administration from enforcing its limits on accepting refugees. A State Department official said the extended time frame accounted for the fact that some refugees will have to make difficult journeys back to airports from refugee camps.

REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah WASHINGTON/DUBAI Yemen said on Wednesday it had not suspended counter-terrorism operations with the U.S. government, despite controversy over a U.S. commando raid on al Qaeda militants in which several civilians were also killed. The raid in al-Bayda province, approved by new U.S. President Donald Trump, resulted in a gun battle that left one Navy SEAL dead and an American aircraft a charred wreck. Yemeni officials told Reuters that Sanaa had not withdrawn its permission for the United States to carry out special operations ground missions but had made clear their "reservations" about the last operation. A statement by the Yemeni embassy in Washington said the government "stresses that it has not suspended any programs with regards to counterterrorism operations in Yemen with the United States Government". The Yemeni government "reiterates its firm position that any counterterrorism operations carried out in Yemen should continue to be in consultation with Yemeni authorities and have precautionary measures to prevent civilian casualties." Yemeni President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi has met with the U.S. ambassador to Yemen and "made clear his reservations about the problems with the last operation," a senior Yemeni official told Reuters. Senator John McCain criticized the operation, telling NBC news on Tuesday: "When you lose a $75 million airplane and, more importantly, an American life is lost … I don't believe you can call it a success." The Yemeni government has supported a U.S. campaign against the country's powerful al Qaeda branch for more than a decade.

Adele and David Bowie each win five Grammys
Though he was denied album of the year, which went to Adele for “25,” Chance the Rapper made Grammy history Sunday. The 23-year-old South Side artist beat out his primary inspiration, Kanye West, and Drake for best best rap album for “Coloring Book,” and also won best new artist. He praised his parents, Chicago and his keyboardist-producer Peter Cottontale and manager Patrick Corcoran, the core of his homegrown musical mini-empire. Chance’s first Grammy, for best rap performance (“No Problem”), broke an invisible barrier. The rapper has never sold a single piece of recorded music, instead making his music available for free streaming on-line while developing a worldwide following. Recordings that were not commercially sold were previously banned from Grammy consideration, but the academy relaxed its eligibility standards last year, paving the way for Chance’s victory. See more videos Chance also solidified the bond between 20th Century Chicago gospel and 21st Century Chicago hip-hop in a fervent performance with a white-robed choir. Adele also won for song and record of the year (“Hello”) among her five Grammys. But even she seemed surprised to best Beyonce for album of the year. Beyonce’s “Lemonade” “was monumental,” she said.

Malaysian authorities arrest fourth suspect in killing of Kim Jong Nam, half-brother of North Korean leader
Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) Authorities have arrested a fourth suspect in the mysterious death of the half brother of North Korea's leader. He is one of four people detained in the death of Kim Jong Nam , the estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The victim was on his way to catch a flight Monday morning to see his family in Macau when he died. Police say they believe he was sprayed with poison as he waited to board the flight at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. In addition to the North Korean man, an Indonesian woman, a Malaysian man and another woman carrying Vietnamese identification have been arrested. 'She was used' The Indonesian woman, identified as Siti Aishah, thought she was participating in a television prank show when she squirted liquid in the victim's face, Indonesian police said. Aishah said she was "not aware it was an assassination attempt by alleged foreign agents," Indonesian police chief Tito Karnavian told reporters in Aceh Province. She said she had sprayed others in a similar manner "three to four times (before)." However, Karnavian told journalists, in this case, "there was allegedly a dangerous substance in the sprayer." 02:42 Aishah said "she was given a few dollars for the job," Karnavian said. "She was used but she didn't know what it was for."

Invited or not, news outlets criticize White House decision to pick and choose their peers
The White House has blocked several major news outlets from covering its daily press briefing without any explanation. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Friday hand-selected news outlets to participate in an off-camera “gaggle” with reporters inside his West Wing office instead of the James S Brady Press Briefing Room. The news outlets blocked from the press briefing include organisations that President Trump has criticised by name. CNN, BBC, The New York Times, LA Times, New York Daily News, BuzzFeed, The Hill, and the Daily Mail were among the news outlets barred from the gathering. Instead, the press secretary hand-picked news outlets including Breitbart News, One America News Network and The Washington Times, all news organisations with far-right leanings. Other major outlets approved included ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, Reuters and Bloomberg. “Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties,” Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, said in a statement. Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest.” BuzzFeed’s editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, also responded to his outlet being barred from the briefing: “While we strongly object to the White House’s apparent attempt to punish news outlets whose coverage it does not like, we won’t let these latest antics distract us from the work of continuing to cover this administration fairly and aggressively.” And the BBC's Washington bureau chief, Paul Danahar, said: “We understand there may be occasions when, due to space or circumstances, the White House restricts press events to the established pool. “However, what happened today did not fit into that pattern. "The BBC has a representative at every daily White House briefing so we are not clear why we were barred from today's.

Siti Aisyah, an Indonesian, and Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam, were detained after closed circuit television showed them accosting Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 13. Police say the women rubbed a highly toxic VX nerve agent on Kim's face before running away. He died on the way to a hospital less than 20 minutes later. Malaysia's Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali told CNN the women will be officially charged on Wednesday. Intentional murder is punishable by a mandatory death sentence in Malaysia. Aisyah has denied she killed Kim on purpose, telling Indonesian officials she believed she was working on a prank show and was smearing Kim's face with baby oil.

Travel ban 2.0 exempts Iraqis, U.S. permanent residents
Washington (CNN) US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order Monday that bans immigration from six Muslim-majority countries, dropping Iraq from January's previous order, and reinstates a temporary blanket ban on all refugees. The new travel ban comes six weeks after Trump's original executive order caused chaos at airports nationwide before it was blocked by federal courts. It removes out language in the original order that indefinitely banned Syrian refugees and called for prioritizing the admission of refugees who are religious minorities in their home countries. That provision drew criticism of a religious test for entry and would have prioritized Christians over Muslims fleeing war-torn countries in the Middle East. The new ban, which takes effect March 16, also explicitly exempts citizens of the six banned countries who are legal US permanent residents or have valid visas to enter the US -- including those whose visas were revoked during the original implementation of the ban, senior administration officials said. "We cannot compromise our nation's security by allowing visitors entry when their own governments are unable or unwilling to provide the information we need to vet them responsibly, or when those governments actively support terrorism," Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday. The new measures will block citizens of Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from obtaining visas for at least 90 days. The order also suspends admission of refugees into the US for 120 days, directing US officials to improve vetting measures for a program that is already widely regarded as extremely stringent. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Iraq's removal from the list came after an intense review from the State Department to improve vetting of Iraqi citizens in collaboration with the Iraqi government, though he did not specify how vetting had been improved.

Wikileaks publishes files on CIA hacking abilities
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The CIA has not said if the claims are true Wikileaks has published details of what it says are wide-ranging hacking tools used by the CIA. The alleged cyber-weapons are said to include malware that targets Windows, Android, iOS, OSX and Linux computers as well as internet routers. Some of the software is reported to have been developed in-house, but the UK's MI5 agency is said to have helped build a spyware attack for Samsung TVs. A spokesman for the CIA would not confirm the details. "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents," he said. Wikileaks said that its source had shared the details with it to prompt a debate into whether the CIA's hacking capabilities had exceeded its mandated powers. Embarrassment factor - Analysis by BBC's security correspondent Gordon Corera These latest leaks - which appear to give details of highly sensitive technical methods - will be a huge problem for the CIA. There is the embarrassment factor - that an agency whose job is to steal other people's secrets has not been able to keep their own. Because many of the initial documents point to capabilities targeting consumer devices, the hardest questions may revolve around what is known as the "equities" problem. This is when you find a vulnerability in a piece of technology how do you balance the benefit to the public of telling the manufacturer so they can close it and improve everyone's security with the benefit to the spy agency of leaving it in place so they can exploit it to collect intelligence. The NSA has already faced questions about whether it has this balance right when many of its secrets were revealed by Edward Snowden, and now it may be the CIA's turn.

UK chancellor raises national insurance payments for self employed in new budget
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The changes are expected to raise £145m a year by 2021-22 Chancellor Philip Hammond has increased National Insurance bills for self-employed people in his first Budget - leading to accusations he has broken a manifesto pledge not to raise taxes. There was also £2bn for social care services in England, and help for firms hit by business rate rises. On the economy he said growth was expected to be higher - and borrowing lower - than forecast in November. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was "a Budget of utter complacency". Mr Hammond said there had been a "dramatic increase" in the number of people working as self-employed - and that the reason for doing so should not be "differences in tax treatment". The disparity between the rates paid by the self-employed and employees "undermines the fairness of our tax system", he said. Class 4 National Insurance contributions will go up to 10% from 9% and to 11% in April 2019, Mr Hammond told MPs. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chief Secretary to the Treasury tells The World at One the "majority" of the self-employed will see a tax reduction On its own, the change announced in the Budget would affect 2.5 million people. But a separate category of National Insurance payments, Class 2, are already due to be abolished from 2018, and Mr Hammond said that taken together the two changes meant NI payments for a self-employed person would be on average 60p a week higher. The Treasury later said that 1.6 million people would, on average, pay £240 more a year and no-one earning less than £16,250 would be worse off. Mr Hammond said the different National Insurance rates had traditionally reflected a disparity in pension and benefit entitlement between self-employed people and those in employment. But he said these had now been "very substantially reduced", and that the government would also consult on addressing disparities in relation to parental benefits.

Six aid workers dead in ambush in South Sudan

The "heinous murder" occurred on Saturday, said Eugene Owusu, the UN's humanitarian chief in South Sudan. The UN did not say who the victims were or what aid agency they worked for. They were traveling between Juba, the capital, and the town of Pibor. At least 79 aid workers have been killed in South Sudan since the conflict started in December 2013, the UN says. "These attacks against aid workers and aid assets are utterly reprehensible," said Mr Owusu. "They not only put the lives of aid workers at risk, they also threaten the lives of thousands of South Sudanese who rely on our assistance for their survival." He called on "all those in positions of power" to stop such attacks and end "the impunity that has prevailed". On 10 March, local staff of an international aid organisation were detained by armed rebels during fighting in Mayendit town for four days before being released.

Impeached South Korean president Park Geun-hye arrested
Park Geun-hye: South Korea's former president arrested over corruption allegations Updated South Korea's disgraced former president Park Geun-hye — the country's first democratically elected leader to be thrown out of office — has been arrested over high-profile corruption allegations of bribery and abuse of power. Key points: Ms Park has been taken to a detention facility and faces over 10 years in prison Her ousting leaves behind a political vacuum amid rising tensions with North Korea The scandal has also landed the head of the Samsung Group in detention and on trial A convoy of vehicles, including a black sedan carrying Ms Park, entered a detention facility near Seoul after the Seoul Central District Court granted prosecutors' request to arrest her. Many Park supporters waved national flags and shouted "president" as the car entered the facility. Ms Park can be held in a cell for up to 20 days while she is investigated over allegations that she colluded with a friend, Choi Soon-sil, to pressure big businesses to contribute to now-defunct foundations set up to back her policy initiatives. A judge at the Seoul Central District Court said in a statement that "the cause and the need for the warrant are recognised as the main charges against her have been verified and as evidence could be destroyed". Ms Park gave about eight hours of testimony at the same court on Thursday and was held at the prosecutors' office next door while the judge studied the evidence and arguments to decide on whether to issue the arrest warrant. On Thursday, Ms Park, 65, arrived expressionless at the court to plead her case that she should not be arrested or held while prosecutors investigate the scandal. Ms Park argues that she does not pose a flight risk and will not try to tamper with evidence She and Ms Choi have both denied any wrongdoing. Ms Park's removal from office capped months of paralysis and turmoil over the corruption scandal that also landed the head of the Samsung conglomerate in detention and on trial. Her impeachment this month has left a political vacuum, with only an interim president pending a May 9 election, at a time of rising tensions with North Korea over its weapons program and with China, which is angry over South Korea's decision to host a US anti-missile system. Ms Park may be given a bigger cell than other inmates in a Seoul detention facility, but she would be subject to the same rules on everything from meals to room inspections, former prosecution and correctional officials have said.

Celtic FC wins sixth consecutive Scottish Premiership title
Celtic wrapped up the league with eight games to spare Manager Brendan Rodgers said he is "very content" at Celtic after clinching the Premiership title in his debut season. "I couldn't think of a better place for me to be at this stage of my life," said the former Liverpool boss, 44. "Sometimes that ambition, you have to be careful, you have to really appreciate what you have. "The beauty of this group of players and how we're going forward is that they're only going to get better." Celtic remain unbeaten domestically, winning a sixth consecutive title with eight matches to spare, having won 28 from 30. Rodgers' side have been top of the table since their third weekend in the competition and wrapped it up with a thumping 5-0 win at Hearts on Sunday. The club still has a Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers to come as they chase a possible domestic treble. "We'll add to the squad, not very many, all I want to do is add quality. "I've only started in management really, I've had five jobs.

REUTERS/Ammar Abdullah BEIRUT A suspected Syrian government chemical attack killed scores of people, including children, in the northwestern province of Idlib on Tuesday, a monitoring group, medics and rescue workers in the rebel-held area said. The U.S. government believes the chemical agent sarin was used in the attack, a U.S. government source said, adding it was "almost certainly" carried out by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian military denied responsibility and said it would never use chemical weapons, echoing denials it has made over the course of the more than six-year Syrian civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands, created the world's worst refugee crisis and drawn in nations such as Russia, Iran and the United States. If confirmed, the incident reported in the town of Khan Sheikhoun would be the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near Damascus in August 2013.

Theresa May calls for June general election
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The moment PM called for general election UK Prime Minister Theresa May has announced plans to call a snap general election on 8 June. She said Britain needed certainty, stability and strong leadership following the EU referendum. Explaining the decision, Mrs May said: "The country is coming together but Westminster is not." Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party wanted the election, calling it a chance to get a government that puts "the majority first". The prime minister will refuse to take part in televised leader debates ahead of the vote, Number 10 sources said. Mr Corbyn said Mrs May should not be "dodging" a head-to-head encounter, and the Lib Dems urged broadcasters to "empty-chair" the prime minister - hold a debate without her. A BBC spokesman said that it was too early to say whether the broadcaster would put in a bid to stage a debate. There will be a vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday to approve the election plan - the prime minister needs two thirds of MPs to vote in favour to bring forward the next scheduled election date of 2020. Explaining her change of heart on an early election, Mrs May said: "I have concluded the only way to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead is to hold this election." She accused Britain's other political parties of "game playing", adding that this risks "our ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn: "I want to lead a government that will transform this country" "I have only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion. Since I became prime minister I've said there should be no election until 2020, but now I have concluded that the only way to guarantee certainty and security for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions we must take."
