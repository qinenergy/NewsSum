British white paper on public health
From smoking bans to personal trainers, government unveils how it wants people to help themselves to live longer John Reid, the health secretary, yesterday championed personal choice over state dictation as he launched the government's wide-ranging blueprint for disease prevention ranging from smoking bans to personal health trainers, curbs on advertising junk food to children, and speedier access to sexual health clinics. The white paper on public health in England, Choosing Health, went further than some expected in restricting tobacco in public places - smoking at the bar will be illegal even in pubs where cigarettes are not banned - but the emphasis was on allowing individuals to make their own health choices, with NHS support where wanted. Food and advertising industries were also given the chance to respond to concerns about their part in tackling the obesity epidemic, while an industry-funded lobby group was left in control of health messages related to sensible drinking. The medical profession was disappointed but Mr Reid said: "In a free society, men and women ultimately have the right within the law to choose their own lifestyle, even when it may damage their own health. But people do not have the right to damage the health of others, or to impose an intolerable degree of inconvenience or nuisance to others. We therefore intend to shift the balance significantly in favour of smoke-free environments." Justifying his decision not to implement a total smoking ban in public places, he said: "I am not a medical officer. I'm a politician charged with maintaining a free democratic society ... A lot of effort is about making sure that people who cannot afford personal trainers and lifestyle gurus - all those whose needs have been ignored for 60 years - are going to get their needs met." He said about £1bn would be devoted to putting proposals into action and that could save £30bn in preventable ill health over the next few years. The mantra behind the white paper shifts public health approaches from "advice from on high to support from next door", and central to this is the appointment of NHS-accredited "health trainers" to whom people can turn for advice. These will at first be available only in the 20% of local primary care trusts with the worst healthy and deprivation profiles, but will later spread throughout England. There is also a bigger onus on employers to help reduce sickness absence that costs at least £11bn a year.

South American countries are creating the third bloc in the world The new South American Community of Nations was launched at a summit in the Peruvian city of Cuzco. Peruvian president Alejandro Toledo, said a new country was being born, which would one day have a common currency, parliament and passport. Members of the new community will start by phasing out tariffs. THE NEW BLOC Territory: 17,658,000 sq km Population: 361 million GDP: $973bn Exports: $181bn Unemployment: 12% (Can); 12.9% (Mercosur); 8.5% (Chile) Source: Can (2003) Mr Toledo said the new community would also help member nations "confront the challenges of globalisation so that it is fairer". "If in the past, geography divided us, today it unites us," Mr Toledo said. The move will create a market of 361 million people with a GDP of $973bn, exporting $181bn of goods and services. Stumbling blocs But the BBC's Hannah Hennessy in Cuzco says details and disputes must be resolved if the bloc is to live up to expectations. It is born from the convergence of the two main trade groups of the region - the Andean Community (Can) and Mercosur - as well as Chile, Surinam and Guyana. The Can was created 35 years ago, but it still has not decided on common tariffs for its members.

CBS fires four in fake Bush story fallout
Appoint a senior Standards and Practices Executive, reporting directly to the President of CBS News, who would review all investigative reporting, use of confidential sources and authentication of documents. Personnel should feel comfortable going to this person confidentially and without fear of reprisal, with questions or concerns about particular reports. Foster an atmosphere in which competitive pressure is not allowed to prompt airing of reports before all investigation and vetting is done. Allow senior management to know the names of confidential sources as well as all relevant background about the person needed to make news judgments. Appoint a separate team, led by someone not involved in the original reporting, to look into any news report that is challenged. In a memo to CBS News staff sent Monday afternoon, Heywood said it was a "difficult and important" day for CBS News. "It is an important day because it represents a unique opportunity for all of us at CBS News to learn from the mistakes surrounding the flawed 60 Minutes Wednesday segment and reaffirm our commitment to the American public to practice journalism of the highest standard,'' Heywood said. CBS News anchor Dan Rather announced in November that he is stepping down as anchor of The CBS Evening News in March, on the 24th anniversary of his first broadcast as anchor. Rather will remain with CBS News as a correspondent for 60 Minutes Sunday and 60 Minutes Wednesday. Fouremployees, including three executives, have been ousted for their role in preparing and reporting a disputed story about President Bush's National Guard service.The action was prompted by the report of an independent panel that concluded that CBS News failed to follow basic journalistic principles in the preparation and reporting of the piece. The panel also said CBS News had compounded that failure with a "rigid and blind" defense of thereport.Asked to resign were Senior Vice President Betsy West, who supervised CBS News primetime programs;Executive Producer Josh Howard; and Howard's deputy, Senior Broadcast Producer Mary Murphy. "The combination of a newmanagement team, great deference given to a highly respected producer and the network's news anchor, competitive pressures, and a zealous belief in the truth of the segment seem to have led many to disregard some fundamental journalistic principles," the report said.The piece was aired during a tight and hotly contested presidential race between Mr. Bush and Democratic challenger Sen. John Kerry.

Nepal's King names new cabinet
The King of Nepal seized power yesterday when he sacked the government, put senior politicians under house arrest, declared a state of emergency and put the army on the streets. King Gyanendra promised to restore democracy and order after nearly 10 years of civil war between Maoist rebels and government forces. Speaking before phone lines were cut, diplomats in Kathmandu said armoured vehicles were patrolling the streets. It is the second time in two years that King Gyanendra has dismissed the prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, and the fourth time he has sacked a prime minister in less than three years. Nepal has had no parliament since 2002. The monarch's statement promised to "restore democracy and law and order in the country in the next three years". He defended the suspension of democracy and citizens' rights in the "larger interest of the Nepalese general public", adding that he would chair the new administration. Political analysts said the king seemed to be trying to return to the days when his family ran the country as feudal autocrats and living Hindu gods, before democracy arrived in 1990. Supporters of the palace say he has become frustrated by politicians' ceaseless infighting. In taking power he has shelved several provisions of the constitution, including the freedoms of press, speech and expression, the freedom to assemble peacefully, the right to privacy, and the right not to be held in preventive detention. Amnesty International said it was alarmed that the emergency could be used to justify the disappearance and summary execution of human rights activists, a trend that had become an ugly feature of the fighting in recent months. Mr Deuba told the Associated Press that politicians would "oppose this step", which "directly violates the constitution and is against democracy".

Suspect in BTK killings arrested after 25 years in hiding
Dennis Rader is listed as a municipal worker in Park City Dennis Rader was arrested without incident in Park City on Friday and is now suspected of committing 10 murders, police in nearby Wichita said. Charges are yet to be brought in the case, which had been thought to consist of eight murders from 1974 to 1986. "The bottom line: BTK is arrested," Police Chief Norman Williams told a news conference where he was applauded. The suspect's DNA has been linked to at least one murder, officials said. Tips from public BTK resurfaced last year when a claim was made for an eighth victim. SUSPECTED BTK VICTIMS Marine Hedge, 53 Delores "Dee" Davis, 62 Joseph Otero, 38, his wife, Julie, 34, and their two children Kathryn Bright, 21 Shirley Vian, 24 Nancy Fox, 25 Vicki Wegerle, 28 (pictured) Killer's reign of terror The Wichita Eagle newspaper received a letter in March enclosing photos and a copy of a driver's licence of Vicki Wegerle, whose 1986 murder was never solved. Other letters to media and police followed, some including jewellery that police believed may have been taken from BTK victims. Tips from the public began to pour in and Kansas police took hundreds of DNA samples. Families of BTK victims and Kansas government officials also attended Saturday's news conference where the arrest was announced. Additional victims Chief Williams said that work on the case had brought the victim toll to 10. The two additional victims were named as Marine Hedge, 53, and Delores "Dee" Davis, 62. It had, he said, been a "long journey" and he put the arrest down to "diligence, tenacity, determination and just plain good police work". Most of the victims were women killed in their homes but the first murder attributed to the BTK killer was that of an entire family in January 1974: Joseph Otero, 38, his wife, Julie, 34, and their two children.

Green paper asks for the BBC's Board of Governors to be scrapped
The licence fee was "the fairest way to fund the BBC", Ms Jowell said The governors, whose dual role as regulator and cheerleader of the BBC has been criticised, would be replaced by a BBC Trust and an executive board. The proposals were announced by Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell with the publication of a Green Paper into the corporation's future. The licence fee would be kept for at least another 10 years, she said. The main plans in the Green Paper are: BBC governors to be abolished and a new trust established to "speak up" for the licence fee payer Licence fee to remain - but a review will examine other funding methods BBC told not to "play copycat" or "chase ratings for ratings sake" More programmes to be made by independent companies The governors' current role was "unsustainable" and lacked "clarity and accountability", Ms Jowell told the House of Commons. Instead, the BBC Trust would be the voice of the licence fee payer, make sure the corporation fulfilled its obligations and have powers to approve or veto budgets and strategies. Green Paper in full (1.275 MB) Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need to download Adobe Acrobat Reader. Download the reader here Explaining why she favoured keeping the licence fee, Ms Jowell said it retained "a high degree of public support". "And although not perfect, we believe it remains the fairest way to fund the BBC," she said. It would also examine whether public money, including licence fee funds, should be given to other broadcasters for public service activities.

Bolivian Congress refuse president's resignation
Carlos Mesa has approval ratings of above 50% He offered to stand down on Monday, amid nationwide protests that he said had left Bolivia "ungovernable". Bolivia's indigenous majority had staged a series of roadblocks and protests against his economic policies. The vote came after a day of talks between Mr Mesa and Bolivia's main political parties. Two of the three main blocs agreed to support him, but the BBC's Elliot Gotkine says the refusal of the main opposition party, MAS, to sign up to the agreement could yet complicate matters. "I am willing to keep working with Congress," Mr Mesa told legislators after the vote, in a speech outlining a national "social pact". "We have been given a new opportunity. Today we have managed to bring the country closer together President Carlos Mesa Bolivan press relieved In pictures: Protest history A referendum on regional autonomy and a constituent assembly to define a new constitution would also be established, he said. The president called for ordinary Bolivians to take to the streets to show their opposition to roadblocks and protests. Mr Mesa, a political independent, came to power in October 2003 when his predecessor, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, fled the country over nationwide protests in 2003 that left at least 60 people dead.

China enacts historic "anti-secession" law
Historic law enacted with popular support China enacted on Monday a law aimed at preventing Taiwan's secession from the country. It is hailed unanimously as a "powerful legal guarantee for peaceful national reunification" by lawmakers, government leaders and the general public. The NPC deputies, many beaming with smiles, applauded for nearly one minute upon the announcement of the vote outcome, broadcast live nationwide through state television, radio and major news websites. AM - Tuesday, 15 March , 2005 08:20:00 Reporter: John Shovelan TONY EASTLEY: China is becoming a growing diplomatic concern for the Bush administration. The White House says China's adoption of the "Anti-Secession" law to stop any move toward independence by Taiwan threatens regional peace. From Washington, John Shovelan reports the issue is one of several which will dominate the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's trip to China and the region this week. JOHN SHOVELAN: The passage of China's anti secession law, giving its military the legal basis to attack Taiwan if it moved toward independence occurred just a few days before the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrives in China on her first sweep though Asia. There's been little public focus on the US-Sino relationship post 9/11, but China's hardline stance on Taiwan has added aggravation to a growing list of issues between the US and the emerging Superpower. RICHARD BOUCHER: It runs counter to the relatively positive, the recent warming trends that we've seen in cross-strait relations. It only serves to harden positions. JOHN SHOVELAN: The White House today assured China that it intended to maintain its support for one China and wouldn't support any move toward independence by Taiwan. SCOTT MCCLELLAN: We do view the adoption of the anti-secession law as something that is unfortunate and not helpful to encouraging peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

Symbian licenses email technology from rival Microsoft
Symbian Ltd., maker of the top operating system for "smart" cell phones, is licensing e-mail technology from Microsoft Corp., an unexpected deal with a rival that may bolster Microsoft's bid to extend its dominance in computer software to mobile devices. The agreement will enable users of Symbian-based phones to automatically send and receive e-mail from accounts running on Microsoft's Exchange Server, a network platform popularly used by corporations to manage Microsoft's ubiquitous Outlook e-mail and calendar applications. Symbian, a joint venture formed by some of the world's best known phone makers, has emerged as the best-selling platform for advanced cell phones designed to double as both handheld computers and mobile entertainment centers. However, most of that success has come in European markets where lead investor Nokia Corp. is most influential. In North America and other markets, Symbian has gained only modest traction as compared with rival wireless platforms such as Palm and Windows Mobile from Microsoft. According to the research firm IDC, converged mobile devices accounted for only a few percent of the more than 600 million phones sold in 2004, but that number is expected to grow sharply this year.

Explosion at Texas refinery kills 14, injures more than 100
A massive explosion tore through America's third largest oil refinery last night, killing at least 14 people and leaving more than 100 injured. The blast happened at the western end of the BP plant in Texas City. The cause was unknown, although a BP spokeswoman said that terrorism was "not a primary focus of our investigation". Charles Gregory, who works at the refinery, said he and several colleagues were inside a trailer getting ready to clean the tank when the floor started rumbling. "After that is when it exploded," he said. Judith Mantrell, who was at home on Tiki Island about about five miles across Galveston Bay from the plant, said: "It was unbelievable, the flames shot more than 70 feet (21m) into the air." Ms Mantell, 62, told the Houston Chronicle there was a sharp and short boom that shook her home, rattled her windows and moved her truck inches across the ground. The explosion occurred in a part of the plant used to boost the octane level of gasoline. Daniel Horowitz, the director of public affairs for the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, confirmed last night that Federal investigators had been dispatched to the blast site. The plant, which is about 35 miles (56kms) south-east of Houston, sprawls across 1,200 acres (486 hectares) and has 30 refinery units.

Five dead, over 200 injured as looting continues in Bishkek
Opposition leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev emerged from the Parliament building Friday and said he has been named Kyrgyzstan's acting president and prime minister - a day after protesters drove President Askar Akayev's government from power and unleashed widespread looting. Both the United States and Russia have military bases near Bishkek, the capital of this strategically important Central Asian nation - sandwiched between China's northwest border and Russia's eastern border, with Afghanistan just one country away. Kyrgyzstan was annexed by Russia in 1864 and returned to independent status in 1991, with the breakup of the Soviet Union. The U.S. has 1,000 troops at its Krygyzstan base. Asked Thursday whether the situation poses a hazard to Americans, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said he does not believe U.S. forces will be harmed by the turmoil. In Washington Thursday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the upheaval in Kyrgyzstan could wind up a democratic success story if political change occurs without violence. We know where we want to go," Rice said. Russia meanwhile is saying it would not object if the ousted president, Akayev, wants to go to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin says the situation in Kyrgyzstan is the result of the authorities' weakness and the social and economic problems that had accumulated there. In Bishkek Friday, opposition leader Bakiyev addressed a crowd of about a thousand supporters in the city's central square, announcing his new status as the nation's acting leader and proclaiming: "Freedom has finally come to us." Bakiyev's appointment as acting president was endorsed by a newly restored parliament of lawmakers who held seats before the elections, which fueled protests against longtime leader Akayev and his government.

U.S. willing to sell F-16s to Pakistan, India
The United States has dramatically shifted its arms sale policy toward South Asian rivals India and Pakistan by announcing F-16 fighter jet sales for Pakistan on Friday. (Xinhua/AFP/File) WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhuanet) -- The United States has dramatically shifted its arms sale policy toward South Asian rivals India and Pakistan by announcing F-16 fighter jet sales for Pakistan on Friday. According to White House spokeswoman Dana Perino, US President George W. Bush, on vacation at his Texas ranch, spoke by phone on Friday with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to explain his decision to sell F-16s to Pakistan. During the telephone talks, Singh expressed India's "great disappointment" at the US decision, the Indian leader's spokesman Sanjaya Baru said. India has maintained that the sale of F-16s to Pakistan would pose a threat to the region's security environment. US government officials, however, argued that the sale will notchange the overall balance of power between Pakistan and India. US State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said on Friday that the F-16s to be sold to Pakistan would be newly built but the number was still "undetermined." A senior US government official said earlier that the initial plan is to sell 24 to Pakistan. US officials on Friday also indicated a willingness to sell multirole warplanes to India if New Delhi chooses to buy them fromthe United States. Pakistan has been frustrated for years in its desire to buy newF-16s for its air force, which already has 32 older model F-16s. The United States has dramatically shifted its arms sale policy toward South Asian rivals India and Pakistan by announcing F-16 fighter jet sales for Pakistan on Friday.

Doctor Who returns as UK Saturday night timeslot lord
The new Doctor Who is played by Christopher Eccleston The opening episode of the first full series since 1989 saw the Time Lord - played by Christopher Eccleston - meet his assistant Rose (Billie Piper). Written by Russell T Davies, it is the first of 13 new episodes of the drama, which was first screened in 1963. "We're pleased so many people sat down as a family to watch the return of the Doctor," a BBC spokesperson said. Unofficial overnight figures show the programme got an average of 9.9 million viewers - 43.2% of all viewers - with a peak of 10.5 million viewers, a 44.3% share of the audience. Warm reviews After saving Rose's life the Doctor blew up the department store in spectacular fashion - it was a pretty good beginning Sylvester McCoy Sylvester McCoy's review Doctor Who's comeback helped ramp up the usual Saturday ratings battle between BBC One and ITV1. An ITV spokesman said: "The audience for Ant and Dec was up on the show last Easter Saturday, which got 7.1 million viewers, so we have no complaints." Graham Norton's new ballroom dancing show, Strictly Dance Fever, went toe-to-toe with ITV1's Stars In Their Eyes Live Final - both shows appearing twice in the evening. Later in the evening, Strictly Dance Fever's results show had an average of 4.7 million viewers, peaking at 7.2 million. On ITV1, Stars In Their Eyes had an average of 5.5 million viewers, but peaked at 6.3 million. However, the Time Lord had Graham Norton breathing down his neck too, as a technical problem meant the sound from Strictly Dance Fever was briefly played over the opening scenes of Doctor Who.

UN Secretary General Annan cleared of influencing oil-for-food contracts by Volcker report
I have this morning received from Mr. Paul Volcker and his colleagues the second interim report of their independent inquiry into allegations concerning the United Nations oil-for-food programme in Iraq. As I had always hoped and firmly believed, the Inquiry has cleared me of any wrongdoing. On the key issue of the award of the contract to inspect humanitarian goods entering Iraq under the oil-for-food programme, the report states clearly that "there is no evidence that the selection of Cotecna in 1998 was subject to any affirmative or improper influence of the Secretary-General in the bidding or selection process." I will meet the press later today to make a fuller statement on the findings contained in the report, and to answer questions. The position of the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, was undermined yesterday after an independent inquiry into the oil-for-food scandal heavily criticised his son Kojo and a Swiss company. Although Mr Annan was personally cleared of improper influence in the awarding of a contract to the Swiss company Cotecna, the committee of inquiry's findings about his son left question marks about his stewardship of the UN, which has come under increasing pressure. At a press conference yesterday, the chairman of the inquiry committee, Paul Volcker, said an investigation the secretary general had initiated was "inadequate" and should have been referred to the UN's independent watchdog agency. "As I had always hoped and firmly believed, the inquiry has cleared me of any wrong doing," he said. Asked if he would resign, he replied: "Hell, no." But the secretary general, who is due to retire next year at the end of two terms, could now find it difficult to push through his reform programme, and to pacify his critics. Norm Coleman,a Republican senator, said yesterday: "His lack of leadership, combined with conflicts of interest and a lack of responsibility and accountability point to one, and only one, outcome: his resignation."

China responds to US plan for import quotas
Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, April 5, 2005; Page A15 The Bush administration took a giant step yesterday toward imposing new caps on imports of Chinese clothing, responding to complaints that China's export juggernaut is starting to dominate the worldwide apparel market since the system governing the global industry was changed on Jan. 1. A U.S. interagency panel said it will initiate proceedings to determine whether new limits should be slapped on imports from China of underwear, cotton trousers, and cotton knit shirts and blouses. In a statement, Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez said the administration is committed "to providing assistance to our domestic textile and apparel industry consistent with our international rights and obligations." The move makes it highly likely that a much-anticipated flood of Chinese clothing into the U.S. and world markets will be deferred for a while -- at least for this year, and possibly several more. At year-end 2004, a three-decade-old system of quotas on international textile and apparel shipments expired, arousing widespread predictions that China's enormously efficient and low-cost clothing makers would devastate rival producers once limits were eliminated on individual countries' shipments. But under the terms of its entry into the World Trade Organization, Beijing agreed to allow the United States and other nations to impose "safeguard" caps on imports of Chinese textiles and apparel in the event that such imports rose so quickly as to "disrupt" those markets. The safeguards can limit the annual growth in Chinese imports to as little as 7.5 percent, and they can be used until 2008. Yesterday's announcement came as a huge relief to the U.S. textile industry, which has already suffered massive job losses in recent years, in part because of competition from low-cost manufacturing countries. It has beseeched the administration to take action as quickly as possible against the new threat posed by the Chinese. The European Union, another major market for clothing, is considering similar measures. The U.S. textile industry filed petitions last year seeking safeguards in a number of clothing categories, but those petitions have been tied up in court because they were based only on the potential menace that Chinese imports posed rather than clear evidence of an import surge. Karl Spilhaus, president of the National Textile Association, said the administration's move "is very welcomed by American textile manufacturers who are struggling against a flood of imports from China."

51 suspects named by UN for war crimes in Darfur
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan(R) hands Luis Moreno Ocampo, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), a sealed envelop containing a list of 51 names of people blamed for war crimes in the conflict of Sudan's Darfur region. (Xinhua photo) ¡¡UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhuanet) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday handed Luis Moreno Ocampo, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), a sealed envelop containing a list of 51 names of people blamed for war crimes in the conflict of Sudan's Darfur region. "Now, we have a common task to end the culture of impunity," Ocampo said on receiving the list compiled by the UN-appointed International Commission of Inquiry five days after the Security Council voted to refer Darfur cases to the tribunal as recommendedby an international panel of inquiry into whether genocide had occurred in Darfur. "I will closely monitor ongoing crimes in Darfur as well as efforts to prevent and stop them," he added. Earlier Tuesday, the ICC, based in The Hague, received thousands of documents collected by the Commission, and Ocampo said he would analyze them and assess the crimes and the admissibility of the cases. Meanwhile in Khartoum, Sudan's capital, the UN mission reportedthat some of the tens of thousands of protesters attacked the perimeter fence of the UN Development Program compound. When that failed, they threw stones into it until a group of elders and community leaders passed a letter into the building for transmission to the Secretary-General. Boxes of documents have been delivered to the court Last week, the UN Security Council passed a resolution referring the situation in Darfur to the tribunal. But Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir says his country will refuse to co-operate with the court in The Hague.

Chinese rioters storm Japanese embassy in Beijing
Anti-Japanese protests have been building throughout the week The rallies follow a 10,000-strong march in the Chinese capital - the city's biggest protest since 1999. Protesters are angry at a new Japanese history textbook which they believe plays down Japan's wartime atrocities. Japan has protested to China after stone-throwing protesters attacked Japan's embassy in Beijing on Saturday. Japan's foreign minister is to visit China next week to discuss "a number of bilateral and international issues", a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry said. Security measures At least 3,000 people demonstrated at the Japanese consulate in the southern city of Guangzhou on Sunday, shouting for a boycott of Japanese goods and burning Japanese flags. Hong Kong cable television showed protesters with Chinese flags and banners reading "down with Japanese militarism". The ambassador, Wang Yi, said Beijing did not condone the protests. 'Whitewash' The protests were sparked by new Japanese schoolbooks, which many Chinese say whitewash Japan's occupation of much of China during the 1930s and early 1940s. Critics are angered that one of the books refers to the killing of more than 250,000 civilians by Japanese troops in the Chinese city of Nanjing in 1937 as an "incident", rather than the "massacre" it is known as elsewhere.

Lib Dems launch manifesto
Kennedy: Wants Iraq exit strategy The Lib Dems say replacing council tax with a new local income tax will make 15 million households better off. Mr Kennedy, returning after the birth of his son, also wants UK troops to leave Iraq by the end of the year. The Tories said a vote for the Lib Dems would mean higher taxes, while Labour said the Lib Dems' sums didn't add up. The Liberal Democrats have been the real opposition Charles Kennedy Lib Dem launch Taking charge again on Thursday, two days after his wife Sarah gave birth to their son Donald, Mr Kennedy said the manifesto was "based on fairness, based on opportunity". 'Dignity' He described the document as a "fully-costed and affordable programme to create a fair Britain". It offered "dignity for older people, real opportunity for our children and a fair deal for families", he said. The 20-page newspaper-style manifesto includes plans for a new 50% top tax rate on earnings over £100,000 to pay for its commitments. Download the reader here The party say the typical family will be £450 better off under the local income tax, with half of households paying less, 25% paying more and 25% paying the same. They claim six million pensioners would pay no local tax at all under the plans. But at the launch Mr Kennedy appeared confused about how much the tax would raise and who would end up paying more. There would also be a new "citizen's pension" so women would have an automatic right to a full state pension based on residence, not National Insurance contributions.

Immigration and asylum turn voters off UK Tories
Michael Howard declared yesterday that he would continue to be "vigilant" about immigration to ensure that race relations in Britain are not damaged by unease about the highly sensitive issue. Unbowed by harsh criticism from a television audience on Monday about his hardline stance, the Tory leader said that good community relations went "hand in hand" with firm controls on immigration. "If we are to continue to have good community relations in this country you have to be vigilant," Mr Howard said at the Conservatives' daily press conference. "And if people lose confidence in the system and believe it's out of control, I believe that breeds a sense of insecurity and that's damaging to good community relations." Immigration returned to the fore after Mr Howard came under fire on ITV's Ask the Leader programme and after the Guardian reported that frontbenchers had asked him to tone down his hardline policy. Mr Howard denied that such representations had been made. "No, we have had no such calls, neither to me nor to my office," he said. The Guardian understands, however, that a number of frontbenchers did contact a Howard aide to ask for a "broadening" of the party's election campaign. Mr Howard, who yesterday pledged to crack down on binge drinkers, will today attempt to show that he has a broad campaign by offering help to middle income earners. At his morning press conference the Conservative leader will pledge to scrap the council tax revaluation which is due to take place in 2007. This would save people in band D properties £270 a year. The announcement came amid a dawning realisation across the party that the Tories may be heading for another heavy defeat after a Populus poll in the Times showed that Labour has increased its lead from two to nine points. Few Tories believe that Mr Howard has made a strategic blunder in the way that William Hague alienated middle ground voters with his warning about Britain turning into a "foreign land". But there are fears that he has made tactical errors, such as concentrating too much on immigration and opening the party up to charges that its brief manifesto looks more like a list of grievances than a programme for government. David Curry, a supporter of the former chancellor Kenneth Clarke who resigned last year from Mr Howard's shadow cabinet, said he was pleased that the party was concentrating on the "real issues" of schools, hospitals, crime, tax and immigration.

Syria: Lebanon pullout is "full and complete", UN to verify
It is not yet clear whether Lebanon has full control of its territory In a report to the Security Council, he said he had received a letter from Syria saying full withdrawal was complete - claims the UN is examining. In September, the Security Council passed a resolution calling for foreign forces to be withdrawn from Lebanon. The council is due to discuss Mr Annan's report later in the week. A UN team has just gone to Lebanon to verify the withdrawal of all Syrian troops, military assets and intelligence. Southern control In his report on the implementation of the resolution, Mr Annan pointed out that other UN requirements had still not been met. SYRIA IN LEBANON Military intervention began in 1976 30,000 troops in Lebanon during 1980s, 14,000 by 2005 Syrian forces helped end Lebanese civil war in 1990 and maintain peace Calls for Syrian withdrawal increased in 2000 after Israeli pull-out from southern Lebanon UN resolution calling for foreign forces' withdrawal in Sept 2004 In pictures: Troops leave Mixed reaction from press Lebanese political reaction Mr Annan said several incidents had shown the government did not have full control of all its territory and he added there had been no change in the position of the militias and that armed vigilante groups were now being set up as well. The UN chief said that according to the Lebanese and Syrian governments assertions that Syrian military intelligence had taken up new positions south of Beirut were untrue. Mr Annan said Lebanon had reached a critical juncture and it was time for all parties to set aside the vestiges of the past. He called for free and fair elections to be held on schedule, warning any delay would threaten the security, stability and prosperity of the country. Damascus has denied any role in the death of Hariri, who was killed by a car bomb in Beirut, but the event prompted giant protests calling for the Syrians to go. Prominently seated in the audience was Syria's top intelligence chief in Lebanon, Maj. Gen. Rustom Ghazali, who is widely considered to have held the reins of Lebanese politics for years.

Galloway and Pasqua deny any wrongdoing on their part in the oil-for-food program
The vitriolic tone used by Mr. Galloway was rare for a witness in a Senate hearing. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Galloway, a maverick politician ousted from the Labor Party for his fervent opposition to the Iraq war and his blunt criticism of Prime Minister Tony Blair, did not deny that he had had contacts with Iraq but said that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had met more often with Saddam Hussein than he had. The subcommittee's chairman, Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota, seemed a bit taken aback by the intensity of Mr. Galloway's remarks, stumbling over some questions, or demanding "yes" or "no" answers, which the British lawmaker refused to give. Mr. Coleman, in an opening statement, repeated the panel's accusations against Mr. Galloway. In one transaction, Mr. Coleman said, surcharges of more than $300,000 were paid illegally to the Hussein regime as part of the covert arrangement. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Galloway called this "preposterous," adding, "I have never seen a barrel of oil, owned one, bought one, sold one, and neither has anybody on my behalf."

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Coleman later told reporters he did not consider Mr. Galloway "a credible witness." The United Nations program, which lasted from late 1996 to 2003, was meant to prevent Mr. Hussein from using oil profits for weaponry, while easing the sanctions imposed after the first Gulf War amid charges they had resulted in suffering for the Iraqi people. The unapologetic Mr. Galloway put a dramatic face on a scandal that has been largely bogged down in the arcane details of diverted oil shipments, translated documents, shadowy go-betweens and questionable payments. "The biggest sanctions busters were not me or Russian politicians or French politicians," he said, "the real sanctions busters were your own companies with the connivance of your own government."

BBC drops programmes as third of staff join strike
Striking employees picketed outside BBC Television Centre The BBC said 38% of staff due to work on Monday joined the walkout over plans to cut 3,780 jobs, though unions said they believed up to 55% had taken part. Hardest hit were live shows on BBC Radio 4, Five Live, the World Service and TV channels News 24 and BBC World. Unions threaten further strikes unless "meaningful negotiations" are offered. The strike has scuppered Radio 4's flagship shows including Today and PM and forced changes to BBC One's Breakfast and Chelsea Flower Show coverage. BBC SERVICES DISRUPTED Radio 4's Today, The World at One, PM and The World Tonight cancelled BBC One main 1300, 1800 and 2200 bulletins taken from News 24 Chelsea Flower Show coverage goes ahead but less done live BBC News 24, BBC World and Five Live cut down on live programming BBC News Interactive updated with reduced staffing The World Service, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland plus local stations also hit In pictures: BBC strike Broadcasting union Bectu said up to 15,000 of the 27,000-strong workforce were taking part. The job cuts and plans to privatise parts of the BBC were "savage" and would "decimate programmes [and] devalue the BBC", the unions said. But director general Mark Thompson said they were necessary to prepare the corporation for a hi-tech future and invest more in programmes. He said the service the corporation had been able to offer on Monday was "rather better than we thought". "Clearly we're sorry that some services have been affected and licence fee payers have received a less good service from the BBC than they would expect," he said. "[But] all of our networks are on the air, the disruption has been less than we thought and over 60% of staff have turned up for work as normal." Asked whether the BBC was prepared to negotiate, a corporation spokesperson said: "We would want to say we would want to sit down and talk with them." Bectu's BBC official Luke Crawley said: "The BBC must recognise that a negotiated outcome is the only sensible way to proceed."

Arkansas plans to end its series of April executions by putting to death on Thursday an inmate convicted of murdering a cheerleader and who escaped from prison and killed two other people before being captured again. Brazil's president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has come under growing fire with the emergence of a two-year-old videotape that shows a senior government official soliciting campaign contributions for two of the party's candidates and offering lucrative political favors in return. The official, Waldomiro Diniz, was fired last Friday, hours after the incriminating video appeared on the website of Epoca, a weekly newsmagazine. But the resulting scandal threatens to engulf the leftwing government led by the Workers' Party, which has always portrayed itself as the only clean force in the murky world of Brazilian politics. Mr da Silva is the founder of the party, and he ran three times for president as its candidate before winning in 2002. "Lula is confronting the most delicate moment of his administration," the daily Jornal do Brasil warned on Sunday. Opposition leaders have responded to the revelations by calling for a congressional investigation and demanding the immediate resignation of Jose Dirceu de Oliveira e Silva, the president's chief of staff and Mr Diniz's immediate superior. The Workers' Party president, Jose Genoino, has tried to distance the party from the scandal and the damage it has done by arguing that Mr Diniz was "not enrolled in the party."

Citizen groups ask Congress to file formal "Resolution of Inquiry" against Bush
CORRECTION APPENDED More than two weeks after its publication in London, a previously secret British government memorandum that reported in July 2002 that President Bush had decided to ''remove Saddam, through military action'' is still creating a stir among administration critics. They are portraying it as evidence that Mr. Bush was intent on war with Iraq earlier than the White House has acknowledged. Eighty-nine House Democrats wrote to the White House to ask whether the memorandum, first disclosed by The Sunday Times on May 1, accurately reported the administration's thinking at the time, eight months before the American-led invasion. The letter, drafted by Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said the British memorandum of July 23, 2002, if accurate, ''raises troubling new questions regarding the legal justifications for the war as well as the integrity of your own administration.'' It has long been known that American military planning for the Iraq war began as early as Nov. 21, 2001, after President Bush directed Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to begin a review of what would be required to oust Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader. By July 2002, the war planning was sufficiently advanced that newspaper accounts that month reported details of some of what was being considered. On Aug. 26, 2002, Vice President Dick Cheney appeared before the Veterans of Foreign Wars to warn that ''there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction'' and that ''there is no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends, our allies and against us.'' The White House has always insisted that Mr. Bush did not finally decide to carry out the invasion of March 2003 until after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell presented the administration's case to the United Nations Security Council, in a speech on Feb. 5, 2003, that relied heavily on claims, now discredited, that Iraq had illicit weapons and was supporting terrorism. But the British memorandum, which records the minutes of a meeting of Prime Minister Tony Blair's senior foreign policy advisers, does provide some contemporaneous validation for those accounts, though only through secondhand observations. Among other things, the memorandum reported that Sir Richard Dearlove, the chief of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, reporting back from talks in Washington, had told other senior British officials that President Bush ''wanted to remove'' Mr. Hussein, ''through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and W.M.D.,'' or weapons of mass destruction. ''But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy,'' Sir Richard was reported in the memorandum to have told his colleagues. One of them, Foreign Minister Jack Straw, was reported to have described the case for war as ''thin'' because ''Saddam was not threatening his neighbors and his W.M.D.

Exit poll: 55% of French voters say no to EU constitution
The "No" camp on both the right and the left is jubilant Almost 55% of people voted "No", with 45% in favour. Turnout was high, at about 70%. The vote could deal a fatal blow to the EU constitution, which needs to be ratified by all 25 member states.

Former FBI Second-In-Command says he was 'Deep Throat'
Deep Throat, the secret source whose insider guidance was vital to The Washington Post’s groundbreaking coverage of the Watergate scandal, was a pillar of the FBI named W. Mark Felt, The Post confirmed yesterday. As the bureau’s second- and third-ranking official during a period when the FBI was battling for its independence against the administration of President Richard M. Nixon, Felt had the means and the motive to help uncover the web of internal spies, secret surveillance, dirty tricks and coverups that led to Nixon’s unprecedented resignation on Aug. 9, 1974, and to prison sentences for some of Nixon’s highest-ranking aides. Felt’s identity as Washington’s most celebrated secret source had been an object of speculation for more than 30 years until yesterday, when his role was revealed by his family in a Vanity Fair magazine article. Even Nixon was caught on tape speculating that Felt was “an informer” as early as February 1973, at a time when Deep Throat was supplying confirmation and context for some of The Post’s most explosive Watergate stories. But Felt’s repeated denials, and the stalwart silence of the reporters he aided -- Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein -- kept the cloak of mystery drawn up around Deep Throat. In place of a name and a face, the source acquired a magic and a mystique. This image was rendered indelibly by the dramatic best-selling memoir Woodward and Bernstein published in 1974, “All the President’s Men.” Two years later, in a blockbuster movie of the same name, actor Hal Holbrook breathed whispery urgency into the suspenseful late-night encounters between Woodward and his source. For many Americans under 40, this is the most potent distillation of the complicated brew that was Watergate. “Mark Felt at that time was a dashing gray-haired figure,” Woodward recalled, and his experience as an anti-Nazi spy hunter early in his career at the FBI had endowed him with a whole bag of counterintelligence tricks. Felt dreamed up the signal by which Woodward would summon him to a meeting (a flowerpot innocuously displayed on the reporter’s balcony) and also hatched the countersign by which Felt could contact Woodward (a clock face inked on Page 20 of Woodward’s daily New York Times). “He knew he was taking a monumental risk,” said Woodward, now an assistant managing editor of The Post whose catalogue of prizewinning and best-selling work has been built on the sort of confidential relationships he maintained with Deep Throat. Felt also knew, by firsthand experience, that Nixon’s administration was willing to use wiretaps and break-ins to hunt down leakers, so no amount of caution was too great in his mind.

US Congress House panel OKs big cut in public broadcasting funds
agenda is to control public broadcasting or to defund it," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. "House Republicans have gutted funding for public broadcasting stations across the country." Advertisement Continue reading the main story The vote came as public stations and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are engaged in a debate over the editorial balance in programming and the independence of the stations. The head of the Republican-controlled corporation, Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, has pressed public broadcasting to correct what he and other conservatives consider liberal bias. That has prompted public broadcasting leaders -- including the chief executive of PBS -- to object that his actions pose a threat to editorial independence. Some public broadcasting officials have begun to express concern that the perception of political interference by the corporation would discourage individuals from making financial contributions to the stations. Mr. Tomlinson, meanwhile, has said that the perception that the stations are not balanced could prompt the Republican-controlled Congress to significantly reduce financing.

Mr. Tomlinson said in an interview in April that he had recommended that the board of the corporation appoint Patricia Harrison, a former co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee and assistant secretary of state, as the organization's next president.

Bomb blasts kill several in Iran
The bombs in Ahwaz exploded over a two-hour period Four blasts targeted public buildings in the south-western city of Ahwaz, killing at least eight people and wounding more than 70 others. Hours later, a bomb exploded in the capital Tehran, killing two people. Bombings have been rare in Iran since the war with Iraq ended in 1988. Ahwaz, which is close to the Iraq border, was the focus of unrest between Arabs and Persians in April, when several people were reportedly killed. Two went off near government offices and a fourth exploded near the home of a local state television executive. The interior ministry also confirmed that a bottle filled with explosives blew up in Vali Asr square in central Tehran, but there were no reports of casualties. A spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's top security decision-making body, blamed the attacks on separatist Arabs aided by members of the armed Iraq-based opposition group, the People's Mujahideen, and remnants of the Baath Party. The spokesman, Agha Mohammadi, told the BBC he was sure the Americans were behind the attacks and also suggested that Britain might be involved - but he gave no evidence to support his claims. "Whoever is responsible for this, the target of the blasts is to undermine Friday's presidential elections," said interior ministry spokesman Jahanbaksh Khanjani.

Michael Jackson found 'not guilty' on all counts
Jackson not guilty Jurors acquit pop star of all molestation charges   SANTA MARIA, California (CNN) -- A California jury has exonerated Michael Jackson of the child molestation, conspiracy and alcohol charges that could have sent him to prison for nearly 20 years. The jury deliberated about 32 hours throughout the course of seven days before reaching its decision. The clerk of court read the verdicts Monday in a packed courtroom while a large crowd of supporters waited outside. Jackson fans cheered, wept and hugged upon hearing the verdicts.

Prosecutors had charged the singer with four counts of lewd conduct with a child younger than 14; one count of attempted lewd conduct; four counts of administering alcohol to facilitate child molestation; and one count of conspiracy to commit child abduction, false imprisonment or extortion. Santa Barbara County District Attorney Thomas Sneddon sat grim-faced during the reading of the verdict and said later that he would accept the decision. "In 37 years [as a prosecutor], I've never quibbled with a jury's verdict, and I'm not going to start today," Sneddon said. Looking drawn and expressionless, Jackson did not address the throng before leaving the courthouse in a caravan of black sport utility vehicles. His lead defense attorney, Thomas Mesereau Jr., told reporters on his way out of the courthouse that "justice was done."

United States Supreme Court Justice O'Connor to retire
Justice O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the court, has been regarded as a centrist and "swing vote," as was Potter Stewart, the man she succeeded in 1981, after President Ronald Reagan nominated her. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, was just as warm as Senator Reid in his praise of Justice O'Connor - but blunter in threatening to resist a nominee he would find unpalatable. Mr. Kennedy called Justice O'Connor "a mainstream conservative" and "a wise judge who served the nation and the Constitution well." Mr. Bush's choice for a replacement, Senator Kennedy went on, "affects each and every American and has the potential to impact every facet of constitutional law and the freedoms this country was founded upon." "If the president abuses his power and nominates someone who threatens to roll back the rights and freedoms of the American people," Mr. Kennedy said, "then the American people will insist that we oppose that nominee, and we intend to do so."

Newspaper refuses to utilize leaked documents in article
The Nation Fearing Legal Battle, Ohio Newspaper Holds Stories On Wednesday, New York Times reporter Judith Miller was jailed for contempt of court after refusing to testify about a confidential source. "It was documentation that would have been illegal to share, so there wasn't any ambiguity about what we had," Clifton said. The Plain Dealer is trying to find a way to publish the stories without relying on the documents, editor Doug Clifton said. CLEVELAND — The Plain Dealer, Ohio's largest newspaper, is holding two investigative stories based on leaked documents because they could result in the type of court showdown that led to a New York Times reporter being jailed, the paper's editor said Friday. A prosecutor wants information from Miller as part of an investigation of how the name of an undercover CIA officer was leaked to a columnist. Clifton said the Plain Dealer had decided several weeks ago -- before Miller was imprisoned -- to withhold the stories because the leaked documents could result in subpoenas and court sanctions, including jail. Clifton wrote a column June 30 explaining to readers the importance of protecting sources, and how the public would suffer if reporters' ability to gather news is compromised. "I wanted the public to understand that this isn't an abstraction, that this is a real issue," he said Friday. "Things that are important for the public stand in jeopardy of not getting reported because of the state of the law." He said he has never withheld a story because of such concerns.

Wilson calls for Rove removal
Chief presidential adviser Karl Rove testified to a grand jury that he talked with two journalists before they divulged the identity of an undercover CIA officer but that he originally learned about the operative from the news media and not government sources, according to a person briefed on the testimony. The person, who works in the legal profession and spoke only on condition of anonymity because of grand jury secrecy, told The Associated Press that Rove testified last year that he remembers specifically being told by columnist Robert Novak that Valerie Plame, the wife of a harsh Iraq war critic, worked for the CIA. The conversation eventually turned to Plame’s husband, Joseph Wilson, a former ambassador who was strongly criticizing the Bush administration’s use of faulty intelligence to justify the war in Iraq, the person said. Rove testified that Novak told him he planned to report in a weekend column that Plame had worked for the CIA, and the circumstances on how her husband traveled to Africa to check bogus claims that Iraq was trying to buy nuclear materials in Niger, according to the source. Column triggers probe Novak’s column, citing two Bush administration officials, appeared six days later, touching off a political firestorm and leading to a federal criminal investigation into who leaked Plame’s undercover identity. Rove told the grand jury that by the time Novak had called him, he believes he had similar information about Wilson’s wife from another member of the news media but he could not recall which reporter had told him about it first, the person said. When Novak inquired about Wilson’s wife working for the CIA, Rove indicated he had heard something like that, according to the source’s recounting of the grand jury testimony. Rove told the grand jury that three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and — in an effort to discredit some of Wilson’s allegations — informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson’s wife worked for the CIA, though he never used her name, the source said. An e-mail Cooper recently provided the grand jury shows Cooper reported to his magazine bosses that Rove had described Wilson’s wife in a confidential conversation as someone who “apparently works” at the CIA. Robert Luskin, Rove’s attorney, said Thursday his client truthfully testified to the grand jury and expected to be exonerated. His wife’s “ability to do the job she’s been doing for close to 20 years ceased from the minute Novak’s article appeared; she ceased being a clandestine officer,” he said.

Possible 'mastermind' of London bombings captured in Egypt
The U.S.-trained chemist who police believe is the mastermind behind last week's London transit attacks has been captured, Egyptian and Western intelligence sources tell ABC News. Magdy Elnashar, 33, who authorities believe helped build the bombs, was taken into custody in suburban Cairo, Egypt. Elnashar had left England two weeks before the bombings, and British authorities had initiated a worldwide manhunt for him. Police say it was Elnashar who helped the bombers set up their bomb factory in Leeds. Elnashar's capture came as British authorities released the first surveillance photo of one of the bombers in the hours before the attacks. Hasib Hussain, 18, is seen carrying the backpack that exploded on a double-decker bus two-and-a-half hours later. Hussain was described by Britain's top police official as just a foot soldier. British authorities also identified a fourth bomber as a Jamaica-born man with a pregnant wife in England and a mother living in the United States. Officials in Cairo tell ABC News that state security officials have already begun to question him with British agents in attendance. Mr al-Nashar completed a chemistry PhD at Leeds University Magdi Mahmoud al-Nashar, 33, had not been seen by colleagues at Leeds University since early July.

Germany's July unemployment rate falls slightly
Unemployment will be a key issue in the forthcoming general election The number of people out of work dropped by 42,000 to 4.8 million, or 11.6% of the workforce, the Federal Labour Office said. But without seasonal adjustments, the jobless rate rose by 68,000 to 4.77 million, or 11.5% of the workforce. The figures come just two months ahead of a planned general election. The ranks of Germany's unemployed often swell in July, as school leavers and trainees who have finished their apprenticeships enter the jobs market. Companies are also often reluctant to take on new staff ahead of the summer holidays. Political battleground The key element for the economy is really the number of new jobs that are being created, and we haven't seen much progress on that front yet Carsten Klude, MM Warburg The fall in seasonally adjusted joblessness may point to a recovery in Germany's battered labour market, though economists greeted the figures with caution. Unemployment looks set to be a major issue in the forthcoming general election. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's ruling Social Democrat (SPD) coalition is preparing to face an electorate angry at recent record levels of post-war unemployment. Earlier this year, five million Germans were out of work. Opinion polls recently showed the SPD lagging behind the conservative opposition Christian Democrats by up to 17 percentage points. Analysts broadly welcomed the adjusted figures, but remained cautious about the general outlook for the German economy. "Perhaps the worst has passed," said Sandra Petcov, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. "Germany, among the eurozone area, appears to be gaining ground if you look at the most recent indications."

Sudan’s Vice President killed in helicopter crash
Southern Sudanese hoped John Garang would change their lives At least 20 people were reported dead in the clashes in the capital. Mr Garang, Sudan's newly appointed vice-president, died in a helicopter crash as he was returning from Uganda. He signed a deal to end 21 years of civil war in January and was sworn in as deputy leader three weeks ago. His former rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), has nominated deputy leader Salva Kiir as his successor and the next vice-president of Sudan. Eerie calm The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Khartoum says that in choosing Mr Kiir, the SPLM has sent a clear message that there will be no radical departure from the Garang era. US President George W Bush, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and others joined Mr Kiir in urging the Sudanese people to remain calm and continue to implement the peace agreement. Dr Garang was one of the most visionary and incisive revolutionary thinkers and nationalists Africa has ever produced President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda Obituary: John Garang In pictures: John Garang Reaction in quotes Our correspondent says gangs of youths from southern Sudan - Mr Garang's home - appeared on the streets, looting cars, throwing stones and smashing office windows.

However, shortly after an overnight curfew was imposed at 1800 (1500 GMT), there was an eerie calm on the streets, our correspondent reports. Mr Garang steered the SPLM rebels from the Christian and animist south through a war against the Islamic government in the north which left some 1.5m people dead.

"Peter, in addition to being an outstanding journalist, an outstanding leader, was also a very warm and decent man and a great friend and colleague to so many of us," Westin said. "We all got to see how professional he was on the air, and sometimes his urbanity could be mistaken for a certain distance. But for the moment, the finest tribute we can give is to continue to do the work he loved so much and inspired us to do."

Brazilian shot by police on London Underground was not acting suspiciously
Family representatives and campaigners for the Brazilian man shot dead on a London tube train are demanding to know how Scotland Yard allowed misleading information to circulate about his killing. In the wake of a leak last night from the independent report, which revealed eyewitnesses seeing Jean Charles de Menezes being held by police in his seat before being shot in the head, attention has now turned to the initial accounts of his death. These claimed he ran from police, vaulted a ticket barrier and was shot on the floor of the carriage. Helen Shaw, co-director of the deaths in custody campaign group Inquest, said today that differences between the accounts - including the disclosure that he was not, as previously claimed, wearing a bulky padded jacket - raised concerns about police conduct. "The public should be told why the Metropolitan police did not correct the misinformation about Mr de Menezes' clothing and actions once the facts became clear," she said. Asad Rehman, a spokesman for the De Menezes family campaign, said the position of Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, would no longer be tenable if "it is demonstrated that he wilfully misled the public, that he wilfully misled the family about the circumstances of Jean's death." A report in today's Financial Times said surveillance officers mistook him for Hussein Osman, the July 21 bomb plot suspect whose extradition to Britain was today approved by a court in Italy. Initial accounts suggested that Mr de Menezes had fled from armed officers by vaulting over barriers before stumbling on to an underground train, where the officers opened fire. One witness in the carriage, Mark Whitby, 47, whose account formed an important part of the subsequent reports, said he had seen a man who looked Pakistani "hotly pursued by what I knew to be three plain-clothes police officers". According to documents obtained by ITV News from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which is investigating the shooting, Mr de Menezes was filmed on CCTV cameras entering the station at a normal walking pace and even picking up a free copy of the Metro newspaper.

Among those hit were offices on Capitol Hill, which is in the midst of August recess, and media organizations, including CNN, ABC and The New York Times. Caterpillar Inc., in Peoria, Illinois, reportedly also had problems. A small number of computers in an administrative office at San Francisco International Airport also crashed, but they were not essential to the airport's operation, spokesman Mike McCarron said. The FBI said the computer problems did not appear to be part of any widespread attack. While the worm affects primarily Windows 2000, it also can affect some early versions of Microsoft XP, said Johannes Ullrich, chief technology officer of the Sans Institute, a network security firm based in Jacksonville, Florida. "Right now, we're mobilizing our two war rooms," she told CNN. "The key thing I want to stress for customers is making sure that they install security updates as quickly as possible," Wilson said. Although she said that the number of affected computers is unclear, most Windows 2000 customers are business users. And automatic security updates would have protected most home users, she said.

Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson calls for assassination of Venezuela's president
Mr Robertson caused controversy with the comments on his TV show, describing Mr Chavez as "a terrific danger". Venezuela's vice president accused Robertson of making "terrorist" remarks and said the US response would put its anti-terror policy to the test. The US State Department said the comments were "inappropriate" and did not reflect the policy of the US. 'Cheaper than war' Mr Robertson's remarks come amid tense diplomatic relations between Venezuela and Washington. You know, I don't know about this doctrine of assassination, but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it Pat Robertson President Chavez is a regular critic of the US, which regards Venezuela as a possible source of instability in the region. Mr Chavez has accused Washington of conspiring to topple his government and possibly backing plots to assassinate him. Mr Robertson, 75, said on Monday's edition of the 700 Club: "You know, I don't know about this doctrine of assassination, but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it. "It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war ... and I don't think any oil shipments will stop." Mr Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition of America and a former presidential candidate, accused the United States of failing to act when Mr Chavez was briefly overthrown in 2002. Venezuela is the fifth-largest oil exporter and a major supplier of oil to the United States.

Iberia burning: forest fires rage across Portugal
By Sam Wilson BBC News website  Arsonists may be motivated by excitement, revenge, or profit Both countries have arrested more than 100 people on suspicion of arson this summer. Many have been teenaged boys but some are firefighters themselves. More than 30 people have been killed by the blazes, while great swathes of countryside and scores of homes have been consumed. While lightning and other environmental factors are responsible for some fires, the majority are started by humans. 'Hero factor' Many are down to careless accidents - a discarded cigarette or neglected campfire - but a large number, according to experts, are started in cold blood. "Generally about 30% of human-caused wildfires are deliberately set," says Timothy Huff, a former FBI profiler specialising in arson, who has investigated hundreds of fires in California and elsewhere. The figures vary between areas, but Spain's Civil Guard believes at least 125 of the 829 fires it has investigated this summer were started deliberately. Investigators say developers may start fires to clear land The 33-year-old head of a Spanish fire fighting unit has been accused of setting about 15 fires in the Galicia region. A Spanish website reported that he was put under surveillance after expressing anger at not being assigned to a local brigade. Mr Huff lists six potential motives for arsonists: revenge, excitement, profit, vandalism, extremism, and to cover another crime. "Excitement is one of the big ones for wildfires," he tells the BBC News website. This covers not only teenaged boys, getting a thrill by watching a fire take hold and spread, but those motivated by the "hero factor" - people who want to be involved and to take the credit for fighting the blaze.

Chimpanzee genome sequenced
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 31 (Xinhuanet) -- A comprehensive comparison of the newly deciphered chimpanzee genome sequence and that of humans shows our closest living relatives share perfect identity with 96 percent of our DNA sequence, an international research consortium reported Wednesday. In a paper published in the Sept.1 issue of the journal Nature,the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, including 67 researchers from the United States, Israel, Italy, Germany and Spain, described the landmark study comparing the genome of the chimp with that of human. "As our closest living evolutionary relatives, chimpanzees are especially suited to teach us about ourselves," said Robert Waterston, chair of the Department of Genome Sciences of the University of Washington School of Medicine. "We still do not have in our hands the answer to a most fundamental question: What makes us human? The DNA sequence that can be directly compared between the two genomes is almost 99 percent identical. When DNA insertions and deletions are taken into account, humans and chimpsstill share 96 percent of their sequence, the researchers found. The researchers indicated the rapid evolution of these genes may have contributed to the special characteristics of primates, but further studies are needed to explore the possibilities.

It is not clear when or where the tape was filmed. Muslim groups and relatives of the victims of the bombings have expressed outrage at the message. On the tape the bomber said: "Our words are dead until we give them life with our blood. "I and thousands like me have forsaken everything for what we believe." He said the public was responsible for the atrocities perpetuated against his "people" across the world because it supported democratically elected governments who carried them out. "Until we feel security, you will be our targets," he said. "Until you stop the bombing, gassing, imprisonment and torture of my people we will not stop this fight.

Federal response to Katrina a "national disgrace"
The mayor of New Orleans issued "a desperate SOS" yesterday as the effort to evacuate thousands of people still trapped in the flooded city was hindered by mob violence and gunfire. The appeal came as angry crowds clashed with police, and the city's police chief warned that storm victims were being raped and beaten on the streets. National guardsmen were moving into New Orleans in armoured vehicles to re-establish order and help the evacuation. But reports from the city described desperate scenes in the Superdome stadium and the city convention centre, where tens of thousands were awaiting evacuation, with fights breaking out, rubbish catching fire and dead bodies left uncollected. According to the police chief, Eddie Compass, an angry mob drove back 88 officers who were sent to restore order. "We have individuals who are getting raped, we have individuals who are getting beaten," he said. Hurricane Katrina, which struck America's Gulf coast on Monday, and the subsequent flooding of New Orleans, is believed by officials to have taken thousands of lives. Aid officials said helicopter missions to evacuate patients from New Orleans hospitals had been suspended because some helicopters had come under fire, possibly from armed civilians angry they were not being rescued. According to a New Orleans report, a police station had come under attack on Wednesday night, and some policemen were leaving their posts yesterday afternoon. President George Bush called for "zero tolerance" towards criminals and promised the federal government was doing everything possible to speed the rescue. But the city's mayor, Ray Nagin, predicted there would not be enough buses to rescue people in the convention centre "This is a desperate SOS," Mr Nagin said on CNN TV.

President Bush nominates John Roberts as Chief Justice of the U.S.
Not one senator has shown outright opposition to Judge Roberts Mr Roberts had originally been nominated to replace another Supreme Court judge who is retiring, and was awaiting Senate confirmation. Mr Bush described him as a man of integrity and fairness with a reputation for goodwill and decency. Democrats will want to question him on issues such as abortion, church-state matters and the environment. However correspondents say his nomination is unlikely to prove controversial. Mr Rehnquist, a conservative appointed chief justice by President Reagan in 1986, died at the age of 80 on Saturday from thyroid cancer. Confirmation hope Mr Roberts, 50, said he would be honoured "to succeed a man I deeply respect and admire". He said he would do so in a "timely manner".

FEMA head relieved of duties
Amid harsh criticism of federal relief efforts, Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff announced Friday that Michael Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is handing over Hurricane Katrina relief duties to a Coast Guard official and returning to Washington to oversee the national office. “Other challenges and threats remain around the world,” and Brown is needed to prepare for those, Chertoff said at a news conference in Baton Rouge. “Michael Brown has done everything he possibly could to coordinate the federal response to this unprecedented challenge,” Chertoff added. He sidestepped a question on whether the move was the first step toward Brown’s leaving FEMA. But a source close to Brown, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the FEMA director had been considering leaving after the hurricane season ended in November and that Friday’s action virtually assures his departure. Coast Guard Vice Adm. Thad Allen Brown, 50, is handing over relief duties to Coast Guard Vice Adm. Thad Allen, who earlier this week was named Brown's deputy to oversee relief and rescue efforts. Chertoff did not allow reporters to ask Brown questions directly and would not respond to the Time magazine report Friday that Brown’s official biography overstated his emergency-management experience. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Friday that local and state officials shouldn’t have to share in the blame for the poor response because they “were in fact victims and not able to respond.” Brown blames media Asked ahead of the announcement if he was being made a scapegoat, Brown told The Associated Press after a long pause: "By the press, yes. “I’m anxious to get back to D.C. to correct all the inaccuracies and lies that are being said,” Brown said. I’m still the director of FEMA.” He said Chertoff made the decision to move him out of Louisiana.

All major American TV networks show charity concert for Katrina victims
share tweet email With the flood waters of Katrina yet to recede, Randy Newman sang about a long-ago hurricane in “Louisiana 1927” to open a benefit program spread across dozens of television networks Friday. Dr. John ended a show suffused with the spirit of a musical city singing a song that’s only a wish now: “Walkin’ to New Orleans.” The hour-long appeal was an echo of a somber event held four years ago to benefit victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, with the same producer. This time, the telethon had more determination than shock and featured native jazz, gospel and swamp-rock sounds. “Tonight let’s show people on the Gulf Coast that they have friends all over the world, friends who care, who understand and are there to give them shelter from the storm,” said comic Ellen DeGeneres, who was raised in New Orleans. ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, UPN and the WB — the six biggest broadcast networks — aired it along with several cable networks. Viewers in nearly 100 countries were able to tune in. BET was also appealing for help Friday for victims of a tragedy that struck the black community hard, and MTV planned its own concert for Saturday. Former President Bill Clinton called in to the BET telethon to express support and was asked by co-host Steve Harvey what his administration would have done differently if it were in power during the hurricane. Clinton refrained from criticizing Bush, but talked about the importance he placed on the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “We always thought faster was better than slower,” Clinton said. NBC stations televised an appeal last week, marked by rapper Kanye West’s off-script comment that “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” The performers largely stuck to scripts Friday, including West, who sang “Jesus Walks” with a gospel choir.

Panic-buying as petrol protests sweep Britain
Cars queue for petrol in Essex on Tuesday - Photo by Paul Wood The Fuel Lobby's Andrew Spence said no oil refinery blockades were planned so there was no need to stock up. Some petrol stations have reportedly "run dry", while others are employing extra staff to cope with the demand. Merseyside Police have asked people not to ring 999 to ask where to buy fuel after phone lines became strained. HAVE YOUR SAY Have ensured that both mine and my wife's car is full, and made a special trip out to fill up my bike too Paul Sealey, Cannock, England Send us your comments And there are reports of lines of motorists topping up their tanks in Kent, Lincolnshire, Manchester and long queues at station forecourts in east London. Last week the government reportedly discussed plans to deal with a threat to fuel supplies - including the possibility of petrol rationing. A Department of Trade and Industry document details possible measures including purchase limits, restricted opening hours, and moves to discourage motorists from frequently topping up their fuel tanks. Mr Spence told BBC News it was this talk of rationing that had prompted motorists to stock up. Mr Spence said peaceful protests planned for Wednesday were an act of desperation from haulage and farming industries facing collapse. Petrol Retailers Association director Ray Holloway said there had been a day of increased sales and urged the government to set a pre-emptive "minimum fuel purchase". It is just ridiculous to not step in now and bring those prices down Garagewatch head Mark Bradshaw That would prevent drivers with nearly-full tanks needlessly queuing, as many did during the fuel protests in 2000, he said. He also warned motorists to behave responsibly: "I really do appeal to people to actually just buy fuel when they need it.

US clinic plans first face transplant
The procedure would take about 10 hours Doctors in the US have already carried out the procedure on bodies donated for medical research. Now the Cleveland Clinic team will choose a patient whose face is disfigured to receive a "new" face from a dead donor. The chance it will work is around 50% and experts have expressed safety and ethical concerns about the procedure. A new face The recipient would have to take powerful anti-rejection drugs for life, which carry considerable long-term health risks, says the Royal College of Surgeons of England, which formed a working party to look at the issue earlier this year. Also, it is not known how well an individual and their loved ones would adapt psychologically to a completely new face. There are a great many questions to which answers are needed Changing Faces charity It is hard to predict what the person would look like after a face transplant. The procedure would involve taking skin and underlying tissues from a dead donor and placing them on the living recipient. The face should take on more of the characteristics of the skeleton of the recipient than the soft tissues of the donor. Picking a patient The working party said it was not against facial transplants in theory, saying they could offer a major breakthrough in restoration of quality of life to those whose faces have been destroyed by accidents or disease. You want to choose patients who are really disfigured, not someone who has a little scar Surgeon Maria Siemionow But it cautioned: "Until there is further research and the prospect of better control of these complications, it would be unwise to proceed with human facial transplantation." After a year of discussions, the Cleveland Clinic won approval to go ahead with the operation from an internal review board, which included surgeons, psychiatrists, social workers, therapists, nurses and patient advocates. Dr Siemionow told Associated Press: "You want to choose patients who are really disfigured, not someone who has a little scar."

Basra, Iraq raid by UK forces to rescue soldiers from police
BAGHDAD, Sept. 19 (Xinhuanet) -- Iraqi police detained two British soldiers in civilian clothes in the southern city Basra for firing on a police station on Monday, police said. "Two persons wearing Arab uniforms opened fire at a police station in Basra. A police patrol followed the attackers and captured them to discover they were two British soldiers," an Interior Ministry source told Xinhua. The two soldiers were using a civilian car packed with explosives, the source said. The British forces informed the Iraqi authorities that the two soldiers were performing an official duty, the source said. British military authorities said they could not confirm the incident but investigations were underway. BAGHDAD, Sept. 19 -- British armored vehicles backed by helicopter gunships burst through the walls of an Iraqi jail Monday in the southern city of Basra to free two British commandos detained earlier in the day by Iraqi police, witnesses and Iraqi officials said. The incident climaxed a confrontation between the two nominal allies that had sparked hours of gun battles and rioting in Basra's streets. An Iraqi official said a half-dozen armored vehicles had smashed into the jail, the Reuters news agency reported. The provincial governor, Mohammed Walli, told news agencies that the British assault was "barbaric, savage and irresponsible."

White House denies that God told Bush to invade Iraq
Nabil Shaath said he and other world leaders at a Jordan summit two years ago did not believe Mr Bush thought God had given him a personal message. Mr Bush's spokesman said the original allegation, which will appear in a BBC documentary next week, was absurd. Scott McClellan said the comments had never been made. The comments were attributed to Mr Bush by Mr Shaath, a Palestinian negotiator, in the upcoming TV series Elusive Peace: Israel and the Arabs. Mr Shaath said that in a 2003 meeting with Mr Bush, the US president said he was "driven with a mission from God". "God would tell me, George, go and fight those terrorists in Afghanistan. And I did, and then God would tell me, George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq... And I did. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who attended the meeting in June 2003 too, also appears on the documentary series to recount how Mr Bush told him: "I have a moral and religious obligation. "President Bush said that God guided him in what he should do, and this guidance led him to go to Afghanistan to rid it of terrorism after 9/11 and led him to Iraq to fight tyranny," he said. "We understood that he was illustrating [in his comments] his strong faith and his belief that this is what God wanted."

Strong earthquake hits Pakistan, north India, Afghanistan
Rescuers are working against time to reach the injured Search for survivors More than 42,000 people are believed to be injured, said the interior minister. The death toll in Indian-administered Kashmir has risen to more than 550, after the bodies of 250 people were found in one town alone. Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has appealed for greater international help in the relief effort. Large cargo helicopters, "the bigger... the better", are needed to help reach those in "far-flung and cut-off areas", as well as tents, blankets and medicines for the survivors, he said.

Chinese activist severely beaten by "mob"
In the report below, we said that Lu Banglie was so injured in the beating that "his eye [lay] out of its socket" and "the ligaments in his neck were broken". Subsequent reports have made it clear that Mr Lu's injuries were not as serious as had been stated. In particular, a report headed Chinese activist vows to continue, despite beating , printed on October 12, stated, after an interview with Mr Lu, "Although he was in pain from his neck, it was not broken and his eye did not come out of its socket." The readers' editor will write about this in his column on October 17.The last time I saw Lu Banglie, he was lying in a ditch on the side of the street - placid, numb and lifeless - the spit, snot and urine of about 20 men mixing with his blood, and running all over his body. I had only met him that day. He was to show me the way to Taishi, the hotspot of the growing rural uprisings in China. The day I arrived a French radio journalist and a Hong Kong print journalist were rumoured to have been beaten somewhere around Taishi. The Taishi election had also been scheduled for that very day, and news of a hunger strike by one of the two most famous figures in Taishi had just come out. Mr Lu was a very soft-spoken man, one of those skinny guys who looked like he might start tearing at any moment. Born as a peasant in Baoyuesi village of Bailizhou town in Zhijiang city in Hubei province, he was a people's representative and had been in the village of Taishi since the start of a democratic movement in the area. That movement, deeply unpopular with the local authorities, has come to be seen as a weather vane for China's tentative steps toward a more representative society. It has led to beatings and mass arrests among its population as well as for observers who ventured into its environs.

Gunmen, police clash in south Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria
Troops are hunting down those who carried out Thursday's attacks Authorities say that 61 rebels have been killed, but 12 police and 12 civilians also died in the assault on Nalchik in Kabardino-Balkaria province. Officials say militants are holding hostages at a police station in the city, which has been sealed off. Militants from nearby Chechnya are believed to be behind the attacks. A pro-rebel website said a group known as the Caucasus Front had claimed the attack. The raid is the latest in a series of disturbances that have been destabilising Russia's North Caucasus for more than a year. Nalchik is about 100 km (60 miles) north-west of Beslan, where Chechen rebels took hundreds of hostages at a school in 2004, in an attack claimed by warlord Shamil Basayev. 'Find the bandits' Dozens of men armed with rocket launchers are said to have been involved in the fighting which broke out early on Thursday. A local Interior Ministry source told Itar-Tass that rebels launched a "carefully planned" simultaneous attack on police stations, security forces, military and drugs-control offices and the airport. "All hell broke loose, and the impression was that there was shooting everywhere," a resident told Reuters news agency. Deputy Interior Minister Andrei Novikov told reporters that 61 militants had been killed.

Iraq counting ballots
Sunni-led insurgents killed 19 people in Iraq on Wednesday, the opening day of Saddam Hussein’s trial , including six Shiites who were lined up at a factory and gunned down in front of their fellow workers, police said. The day’s fatalities also included three election commission officials who were shot and killed on the outskirts of the capital in Abu Ghraib, as they drove home after another round of counting ballots from last weekend’s constitutional referendum, police said. A bomb also went off at a famous monument in a Baghdad square honoring the 8th-century founder of Baghdad to whom Saddam often compared himself. The blast, which toppled the bust of Abu Jaafar Al-Mansour but caused no injuries, appeared to be a jab at the former dictator. Iraqis are still awaiting the outcome of last weekend’s referendum, as the slower-than-expected vote counting continued. Questions about the integrity of the vote and delays in getting marked ballots to the capital mean final results from the landmark vote won’t be announced until Friday at the earliest, officials said. The returns have raised questions over the possibility of irregularities in the balloting — and have prompted an audit into an irregularly high number of “yes” votes. An argumentative Saddam and seven senior members of his regime went on trial Wednesday for a 1982 massacre of about 150 Shiites in the town of Dujail, north of Baghdad. In Washington, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice heralded the constitutional referendum and said the U.S. strategy in Iraq was to “clear areas from insurgent control, hold them securely, and build durable, national Iraqi institutions.” Rice told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the United States is working to dismantle the insurgent network and disrupt foreign support for them, maintain security in areas insurgents no longer hold, and build national institutions to “sustain security forces, bring rule of law, visibly deliver essential services, and offer the Iraqi people hope for a better economic future.” Brutal attack in ‘Triangle of Death’ Wednesday’s worst insurgent attack occurred in a mostly Sunni region south of Baghdad known as the Triangle of Death because of all its militant groups. About nine militants barged into a building materials factory near Iskandariyah, 30 miles south of Baghdad, lined up all the workers and forced the six Shiite ones to identify themselves, said police Lt.

He said he was guilty of making a mistake on three occasions and was now "paying the price for it". Tony Blair described Mr Blunkett as a "decent and honourable man". Mr Blunkett quit after breaking the ministerial code of conduct over paid work he took while out of the Cabinet. Michael Howard said the events showed a "haemorrhage" of Mr Blair's authority.

Sony faces class action lawsuits for DRM
The CDs affected in the US include Natasha Bedingfield's Unwritten In late October Sony was found to be using stealth techniques to hide software that stopped some of its CDs being illegally copied. Now three virus variants have been found that use the Sony software to evade detection by anti-virus programs. Sony has apologised, saying it is working with computer security firms to address the problems. Viral trio The stealthy methods that Sony BMG used to protect its anti-piracy system were uncovered by Windows programming expert Mark Russinovich on 31 October. It was already getting bad press about its copy-protection software, and this new hack exploit will make it even worse Graham Cluley, Sophos XCP uses these techniques to install a proprietary media player that allows PC users to play music on the 20 CDs Sony BMG is protecting with this system. The CDs affected are only being sold in the US. Soon after Mr Russinovich exposed how XCP worked security experts speculated that it would be easy to hijack the anti-piracy system to hide viruses. Now anti-virus companies have discovered three malicious programs that use XCP's stealthy capabilities if they find it installed on a compromised PC. "The development we feared most from Sony's inclusion of rootkit technology to conceal its DRM software was its use to conceal malicious code," said David Emm from security firm Kaspersky Labs. "Unfortunately, it seems our fears were well-grounded."

Coal mine floods in northern China: 12,000 mines ordered to close
SHIJIAZHUANG, Nov. 20 (Xinhuanet) -- Seven miners were killed in acoal mine flooding accident which took place on early Saturday in north China's Hebei Province while seven others are still missing as of Sunday morning, local government source said. The source said the tragedy occurred at 5:00 a.m. Saturday in Yuanda Coal Mine in Xingtai City, trapping 14 miners underground. Rescue operation started quickly after the accident, and by 7 a.m. Sunday, the bodies of seven miners were found and retrieved but the whereabouts of the seven others remain unknown. Owners of the coal mine have already been detained by local police and the investigation into the cause of the flooding is underway. SHIJIAZHUANG, Nov. 19 (Xinhuanet) -- A coal mine flood early on Saturday has trapped 14 people in north China's Hebei Province and rescue work is going on, the local work safety supervision bureau said. A spokesman with the bureau said Yuanda Coal Mine, a collectively-owned mine in Neiqiu county of Xingtai, was flooded at around 5:00 a.m. and all the 14 miners working down the pit were trapped. Yuanda coal mine reports an annual output of 60,000 tons. This is the second fatal mine accidents in Xingtai in two weeks.

Chinese chemical plant explosion threatens water supply for major city
Panic was today spreading in Harbin, with officials preparing to cut off water supplies as heavily polluted river water flowed towards the Chinese city. Stockpiling began afresh at midnight when the local government switched taps on again for 12 hours after having cut off supplies to almost four million people yesterday. The temporary switch-on came after revised calculations showed the pollution would not reach Harbin until early tomorrow morning. "As the exact time of the pollutants flowing to the city's drinking water intake spot has been confirmed, we hoped that citizens could take time to hoard as much water as possible ahead of the water cut-off," an executive from the Harbin water company said. Residents were storing water supplies in bathtubs and buckets ahead of the expected three-day drought. Supermarkets reported panic buying of water, milk and soft drinks, while Harbin's airport and railway station were jammed with people fleeing the area. The provincial government was also trucking in water from neighbouring areas, testing little-used local wells and demanding 1,400 tonnes of activated charcoal to purify the water intake after the pollution had passed through the city. Rumours of terrorist attacks and an impending earthquake increased public alarm, although seismologists said there was no reason to expect a tremor. The city, in China's icy north-eastern Heilongjiang province, has a population of 3.8 million and draws most of its water from the Songhua. The river has been contaminated with more than 30 times the usual levels of benzene after an explosion at a chemical plant on its banks. Short-term exposure to the chemical in drinking water can cause long-term damage to the nervous system, while long-term exposure can result in cancer and leukaemia.

Further details about Bush-Blair memo stopped
The National Union of Journalists today accused the government of a "double attack on the freedom of the press and freedom of information" after it issued a reminder to editors about the provisions of the Official Secrets Act. The attorney general threatened newspapers with the act and the Contempt of Court Act in the context of an allegedly leaked memo, relating to a dispute between Tony Blair and George Bush over the conduct of military operations in Iraq. This intervention by the attorney general followed the publication of a front page story in the Daily Mirror yesterday under the headline "Bush plot to bomb his ally", in which the paper claimed the memo revealed that the US president last year planned to attack the Qatar headquarters of Arabic news broadcaster al-Jazeera. "This is a heavy-handed attempt to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. It is a double attack on the freedom of the press and freedom of information," said the NUJ secretary, Jeremy Dear. "These sort of attempts to stifle uncomfortable revelations printed in a newspaper, which is only carrying out its proper duty to inform the British public, does the government of what is supposed to be a democracy no credit whatsoever. "What we need in this country is free and open debate and a proper political dialogue over important issues of this sort, not a knee-jerk panic reaction." The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, warned that publication of further details from the document would be a breach under section five of the Official Secrets Act. In its news story on the attorney general's warning today, the Daily Mirror said it had "essentially agreed to comply". · To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 · If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly "for publication". LONDON, Nov. 22 -- President Bush expressed interest in bombing the headquarters of the Arabic television network al-Jazeera during a White House conversation with Prime Minister Tony Blair in April 2004, a British newspaper reported Tuesday. The Daily Mirror report was attributed to two anonymous sources describing a classified document they said contained a transcript of the two leaders' talk. One source is quoted as saying Bush's alleged remark concerning the network's headquarters in Qatar was "humorous, not serious," while the other said, "Bush was deadly serious." In Washington, a senior diplomat said the Bush remark as recounted in the newspaper "sounds like one of the president's one-liners that is meant as a joke." But, the diplomat said, "it was foolish for someone to write it down, and now it will be a story for days."

President Bush of the United States authorized NSA surveillance of citizens, bypassing court warrants
Congressional leaders of both parties called for hearings and issued condemnations yesterday in the wake of reports that President Bush signed a secret order in 2002 allowing the National Security Agency to spy on hundreds of U.S. citizens and other residents without court-approved warrants. Bush declined to discuss the domestic eavesdropping program in a television interview, but he joined his aides in saying that the government acted lawfully and did not intrude on citizens' rights. "Decisions made are made understanding we have an obligation to protect the civil liberties of the American people," Bush said on "The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer." Disclosure of the NSA plan had an immediate effect on Capitol Hill, where Democratic senators and a handful of Republicans derailed a bill that would renew expiring portions of the USA Patriot Act anti-terrorism law. Opponents repeatedly cited the previously unknown NSA program as an example of the kinds of government abuses that concerned them, while the GOP chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said he would hold oversight hearings on the issue. "There is no doubt that this is inappropriate," said Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who favored the Patriot Act renewal but said the NSA issue provided valuable ammunition for its opponents. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a member of the intelligence and judiciary committees, called the program "the most significant thing I have heard in my 12 years" in the Senate and suggested that the president may have broken the law by authorizing surveillance without proper warrants. "How can I go out, how can any member of this body go out, and say that under the Patriot Act we protect the rights of American citizens if, in fact, the president is not going to be bound by the law?" But they defended, in general terms, the administration's aggressive strategies in attempting to combat terrorism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and said that all programs have been lawful and protective of individual rights.

Israeli PM Sharon rushed to hospital
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was transferred to intensive care after seven hours of surgery, and his vital signs are stable, the director of Hadassah Hospital said Thursday. The director, Shlomo Mor-Yosef, said Sharon remains in serious condition. "The prime minister has had a CT scan that showed the cerebral hemorrhaging has stopped," Mor-Yosef said. "The prime minister is now being transferred to the neurosurgical intensive care unit. In the unit, he will be treated, observed and cared for." "At this point, all the vital signs are ... stable. The prime minister is still in serious condition," the director said. Sharon fell ill at his ranch Wednesday evening and was rushed to Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where he was diagnosed with a cerebral hemorrhage. Doctors began emergency surgery about midnight to stop "massive, wide-spread bleeding" in his brain. Surgery apparently had been complicated by blood thinners he had been given following a mild stroke on Dec. 18, and the medication may also have contributed to Wednesday's stroke. Mor-Yosef did not address Sharon's prognosis, but neurosurgeons not involved in Sharon's treatment said a full recovery was not likely following such a massive stroke. They said it usually takes at least a day after the surgery to determine the extent of any damage.

U.S. airstrike targeting Ayman al-Zawahiri leaves 18 dead in Pakistani village
Sources: Airstrike may have killed bin Laden's No. 2 From David Ensor CNN Intelligence suggests that Ayman al-Zawahiri, seen in this September video, may have been killed. RELATED (CNN) -- Ayman al-Zawahiri -- Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in the al Qaeda terrorist network -- was the target of a CIA airstrike Friday in a remote Pakistani village and may have been among those killed, knowledgeable U.S. sources told CNN. There has been no confirmation that al-Zawahiri was killed in the attack, which took place in the village of Damadola, near the Afghan border. However, the sources said there was intelligence suggesting he was in one of the buildings hit during the strike. (Watch how al-Zawahiri was targeted -- 5:39) Pakistani officials were at the scene, trying to determine if al-Zawahiri was killed, the U.S. sources told CNN. Contacted by CNN, Pakistan's information minister could not confirm that al-Zawahiri had been the target of a CIA strike. Eighteen people died in Friday morning's strike -- eight men, five women and five children, Pakistani intelligence sources said. "We are conducting tests to identify the bodies," a Pakistani intelligence official told CNN. The strike came a week after the Arabic language news network Al-Jazeera aired a new videotape with a message from al-Zawahiri, in which he called on U.S. President George W. Bush to admit defeat in Iraq. The U.S. government has put up a $25 million reward for information leading to his capture.

Venezuela will buy Spanish planes with European technology
¡¡CARACAS, Jan. 13 (Xinhuanet) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Friday denounced an attempt by the United States to block Spain from selling 12 military planes equipped with U.S. parts to Venezuela. Washington's refusal to allow Venezuela to buy Spanish-built planes which use some U.S. technology is "an imperialist outrage", Chavez told the National Assembly on Friday. "This is an evidence of the horrible imperialism that Washington wants to impose on the world. I must denounce once again the imperialist outrage against the government and people of Venezuela," Chavez said at the opening of the Assembly. The United States refused permission, requested by Spanish consortium EADS-CASA, to sell 12 warplanes to Venezuela, saying that what Venezuela had said and done contributed to regional instability. The U.S. embassy in Spain said that it hoped the refusal would not harm the "excellent relations" the Bush administration has with Spain. Spain decided in early last November to go ahead with a plan tosell military planes and patrol crafts with a combined value of 2 billion U.S. dollars to Venezuela despite U.S. opposition. The country said on Friday that it will replace U.S. made components with parts made elsewhere, adding that the planes will be used for transport rather than for battling ends. Chavez said that the Venezuelan air force was also having a problem with buying training aircraft from Brazil. The Venezuelan government has been trying to buy Super Tucano fighter planes made by Brazil, but the purchase has also been blocked by Washington as the planes contain U.S. motor technology.

Gore criticizes use of unwarranted domestic wiretaps
In December, The New York Times reported that, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans and others in the country without obtaining the warrants typically required for domestic surveillance. The revelation of the wiretapping has led to calls for an independent investigation by Democrats, and some Republicans. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Bush administration officials have defended the surveillance and said the president's power to authorize it comes from a Congressional resolution endorsing the war against terrorism enacted soon after the attacks.

Al Jazeera airs new Osama Bin Laden tape
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (Xinhuanet) -- Analysts at the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) believed that the voice on a tape, aired earlier Thursday by Arab television station Al Jazeera, was that of Osama bin Laden, an agency official said. The official, speaking anonymously, said that following technical analysis, the CIA determined that the voice on the tape was that of bin Laden, chief of the al Qaeda terrorist organization. Bin Laden warned in the tape that attacks were under preparations against the United States and its allies, and offered a truce in response to U.S. public opinion favoring withdrawal American troops from Iraq. "We don't mind offering you a long-term truce on fair conditions that we adhere to," he said in the tape. He said both sides could "enjoy security and stability under this truce so we can build Iraq and Afghanistan, which have been destroyed in this war." Speaking on the Fox News channel, Vice President Dick Cheney said he believed the truce offer was a ploy and that it was too early to draw any conclusions. "I'm not sure what he's offering by way of a truce. It sounds to me like it's some kind of a ploy, but again not having seen the entire text or validated the tape and the timing of it, I'm reluctant to draw any conclusions," he said. At a luncheon speech in New York on Thursday, Cheney warned that the United States still faced significant threats from terrorists attempting to establish a radical Islamic empire. "Clearly the al Qaeda leaders and other terrorists are on the run, they're under a lot of pressure. We do not negotiate with terrorists, we put them out of business," he said.

Whale spotted in river Thames, Central London
The animal was spotted as it passed the Houses of Parliament The 16-18ft (5m) northern bottle-nosed whale, which is usually found in deep sea waters, has been seen as far upstream as Chelsea. A rescue boat has been sent to protect the whale and rescuers have been trying to keep it away from the river banks. Specialist equipment, including inflatable tubes to re-direct the animal downstream, are being sent. The whale has come within yards of the banks and has crashed into an empty boat causing slight bleeding. The last thing we want to do is stress the animal out Liz Sandeman Marine Connection Watch the whale Whale in pictures Vets are remaining on standby and experts have said it does not appear to be ill, but are concerned it will get weaker and may become beached. Tony Woodley, of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, which will be handling the rescue, said the animal's welfare was the main priority. He said if attempts to re-direct the whale downstream failed, it might be necessary to put it down to prevent from suffering further. A spokesman said three whales were spotted east of the Thames Barrier on Thursday but only one managed to get upstream. She told the BBC News website: "This is extremely rare in British waters as they are normally found in deep waters in the North Atlantic. The whale is thought to weigh about seven tonnes.

Message in bottle travels from UK to Australia
AM - Saturday, 21 January , 2006 08:28:00 Reporter: Kerrie Ritchie TONI HASSAN: When a young British girl put a message in a bottle last year and threw it into the ocean off the west coast of England she hoped she'd hear back from someone. Last week, almost six months later, an envelope arrived at her kindergarten. But when staff opened it, they were shocked to find it had been sent by a 10-year-old boy named Bob, who had found the bottle 14,500 kilometres away in Perth. KERRI RITCHIE: In July last year, as part of a kindergarten project, four-year-old Alesha Johnson drew a picture of herself, and wrote next to it "Hello, if you get this message please write back". She included the address of her kindergarten in the coastal town of Heysham and put the piece of paper inside a bottle. With the help of her mum she sealed it up and threw it in the Irish Sea at Morecambe Bay on England's north-west coast. For six months Alesha Johnson didn't hear a thing, but then last week a letter was delivered to her kindergarten with her name on it. DOREEN JOHNSON: I thought it's rather strange that a child of four was getting a letter with just a first name and nobody you know, and not a home address or anything. I thought perhaps one of the aunties or uncles had done it for her, you know, and popped it in.

Maryland Judge throws out law banning gay marriages
A Baltimore Circuit Court ruling yesterday struck down as discriminatory and unconstitutional a 1973 law outlawing same-sex marriage. The opinion set off a cascade of actions in all branches of state government. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R) wrote a letter to Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. (D) advising him to appeal the decision and offering additional resources to support the effort. · Curran's office moved to appeal. "We have noted an appeal and think it appropriate that the court stayed the operation of its order," Kevin J. Enright, a spokesman for Curran, said in a statement. "We await having the decision of Maryland's appellate courts." · House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) said the House of Delegates set aside Jan. 31 for hearings in the Judiciary Committee on proposals dealing with same-sex marriage, including a proposed constitutional amendment. · The Maryland Court of Appeals will signal whether it will take up the case directly or wait for the mid-level appellate court to rule. BALTIMORE — A Maryland Circuit Court judge sided with nine gay couples Friday, ruling that the state's law defining marriage as being between a man and a woman violates the state's constitution. It is the latest decision in an intense national debate over the rights of gays and lesbians to marry. The ruling in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City will not make Maryland gay couples immediately eligible for marriage licenses, however. Judge M. Brooke Murdock stayed the order pending an appeal, which the state attorney general's office filed right away. "Although tradition and societal values are important, they cannot be given so much weight that they alone will justify a discriminatory statutory classification," the decision stated.

Burns engages India on civil nuclear energy pact
India must separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns made the remarks after two days of talks in the Indian capital, Delhi. Under the deal India would gain access to US civilian nuclear technology. Critics of the accord, which has to be ratified by the US Congress, fear it could harm non-proliferation efforts. "The situation is unique, India's position is unique and there is complexity and difficulty to these talks which is inherent in the subject," Mr Burns told journalists in Delhi. The agreement hinges on India separating its military and civilian nuclear facilities and allowing international inspectors access to its civilian facilities. Correspondents say that may not be very easy as some of the country's major research facilities are thought to straddle both fields. Some US politicians and policymakers feel that making an exception in the case of India, which has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), would send a dangerous signal to non-proliferators, especially countries such as Iran. On Friday, Mr Burns described Iran as a threat to global peace and said it had "overstepped the limits of international law in seeking to pursue its nuclear ambitions". "It stands to reason that India which has with Iran a very longstanding... relationship, would not like see a situation of confrontation developing in a region that is very close to India," Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran said. Indian and US officials have held several rounds of talks to resolve their differences especially ahead of the visit of US President George W Bush to India later this year.

U.S. army interrogator convicted in Iraqi general's death
A US army officer was guilty of negligent homicide in the death of an Iraqi general during an interrogation, a military court ruled on Saturday. Chief warrant officer Lewis Welshofer is the highest-ranking army officer tried on murder charges arising from the Bush administration's campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was found not guilty of murder and faces up to three years in prison when sentencing takes place today. The court heard that Welshofer caused the death of Major General Abed Hamed Mowhoush by putting him head-first into a sleeping bag, tying electrical cord around him, straddling him and covering his mouth. Welshofer was also found guilty of negligent dereliction of duty, which carries a sentence of up to three months. He was acquitted on charges of assault by a jury made up of army officers. Welshofer's lawyer, Frank Spinner, told reporters: "The verdict recognises the context in which these events took place. Prosecutors told the court that Welshofer had crossed a line and had not upheld the Geneva convention. "This case has been about our officer corps' need to maintain the high ground, especially in a country like Iraq where our presence may be resented," lead prosecutor Major Tiernan Dolan said. The defence argued that Welshofer was interpreting an email from superiors sent in August 2003, three months before Mowhoush died. The email, from Captain William Ponce, said: "The gloves are coming off, gentlemen ... we want these individuals broken.

Four Australian states ablaze, two dead, homes lost
The World Today - Monday, 23 January , 2006 12:30:00 Reporter: Daniel Hoare PETER CAVE: As fire-fighters across much of southern Australia continue fighting a number of blazes, the extent of the damage caused by yesterday's fires in Victoria is beginning to emerge. At least seven homes have been lost there and two bodies have been discovered after a car crash in a burnt-out area in the state's northwest. Fire-fighters in four states are trying to extinguish a number of blazes, the worst of which are in Victoria. The weather bureau says there'll be little respite for fire-fighters there, with conditions set to heat up again during the week, reaching more than 40 degrees on Thursday. DANIEL HOARE: Victoria has borne the brunt of the bushfires, which have destroyed at least seven homes across the state. Authorities haven't confirmed whether or not the deaths were a direct result of the fires, but the bodies were found in the car's wreckage in a burnt-out area. Fires have also destroyed sheds and vehicles and killed livestock in a number of areas of Victoria. In Western Australia, the efforts of fire-fighters battling a blaze in the state's south-west are being hampered by hot, gusty winds. The fire started on a blue gum plantation near the town of Dwellingup yesterday. In South Australia, fire-fighters are predicting worsening bushfire conditions as they fight blazes at the Ngarkat Conservation Park in the state's south-east, and on Kangaroo Island. In Tasmania, fire-fighters have had more luck, containing most of the 20 fires which were burning across the state yesterday.

Tensions continue to rise in Middle East over "Mohammad Cartoons"
Muslim protesters infuriated by cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad raised the diplomatic stakes last night as Iran's best-selling newspaper announced it would retaliate by running images satirising the Holocaust. The decision by the rightwing Hamshari daily to launch an international competition to find the most suitable caricatures came as demonstrators hurled firebombs and stones at the Danish embassy in Tehran and the Iranian government imposed a formal trade ban on Danish imports. Last night mobs were attempting to storm the Danish compound. In London, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, branded the activities of Islamist protesters outside the Danish embassy last week as "unacceptable". He told MPs he was pleased the response to the publication of the Danish cartoons had "in general been respectful and restrained in the best traditions of British tolerance". But he added: "If the police conclude there have been breaches of the law and decide to take any action, we would, of course, support them." He said he had not intended to cause offence to the victims of the July 7 London bombings or their relatives but added that his protest remained valid because of the hurt caused to Muslims by the publication of the Danish cartoons.

Egyptian passenger ferry sinks in Red Sea
Most of 1,400 on Egypt ferry feared lost (AP/Reuters) Updated: 2006-02-04 08:26 An aging ferry sank in the choppy waters of the Red Sea on Friday with more than 1,400 people on board, mainly Egyptian workers returning from Saudi Arabia. Most were feared lost but officials said at least 314 made it to safety. A spokesman for President Hosni Mubarak said the ferry did not have enough lifeboats, and questions were raised about the safety of the 35-year-old, refitted ship that was weighed down with 220 cars as well as the passengers. "It's a roll-on, roll-off ferry, and there is big question mark over the stability of this kind of ship," said David Osler of the London shipping paper Lloyds List. "It would only take a bit of water to get on board this ship and it would be all over. Officials said more than 185 bodies were recovered while hundreds remained missing in the dark, chilly sea nearly 24 hours after the ship went down. One lifeboat was spotted from a helicopter during the day bobbing in the waves with what appeared to be about a dozen or more passengers. This is an aerial image from TV which shows people in a dinghy in the Red Sea, Friday, Feb. 3, 2006. "This is a dirty government, may God burn their hearts as they burned mine," one woman wailed, slapping her face in grief.

New Zealand newspapers publish "Mohammad Cartoons"
A renowned New Zealand cartoonist has stepped into the controversy surrounding the publishing of Muslim caricatures in newspapers around the globe. Tom Scott, who in 1969 faced a blasphemy prosecution for an anti-Christian cartoon, said the Islamic community needed to get a sense of humour. "(They) clearly have god on their side so they don't need cartoonists as well," he added. Mr Scott said he was sorry his original blasphemy charge had not gone to court as his defence team "was going to subpoena god". A number of European newspapers recently re-published the Muslim caricatures, first published by a Danish newspaper in September, triggering outrage and protests in some Muslim countries. Two Fairfax papers - The Dominion Post in Wellington and The Press in Christchurch -- yesterday followed suit, despite the outrage they have caused in the Muslim world. A New Zealand Muslim leader yesterday called on The Dominion Post to apologise for its irresponsible and hurtful act in publishing "disrespectful" cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad. "In the name of freedom of expression the media has taken this matter to the extreme," he said. "Freedom of expression does not mean 'absolute' freedom, going as far as mocking other religions and their beliefs. Mr Khan said he hoped The Dominion Post editor Tim Pankhurst, also chair of the Commonwealth Press Union, would "realise the serious implications and damage the paper has caused by such an irresponsible, insensitive and hurtful act against the Muslims."

Neil Entwistle faces two counts of murder, one count of illegal possession of a firearm and one count of illegal possession of ammunition, said Melissa Sherman of the Middlesex County, Massachusetts, district attorney's office. If convicted, he could face life in prison without parole. Massachusetts does not have the death penalty. (Watch the alleged trail of the gun and the suspect -- 3:37) At a magistrate court appearance a few hours later, he acknowledged the charges against him and said he did not consent to extradition to the United States. Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley said authorities believe Entwistle's wife, Rachel, and their 9-month-old baby, Lillian, were shot sometime during the morning of January 20 at their home in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. "There's no indication in the past of trouble," said Coakley, describing the picture investigators got of "a young couple starting out on a happy future." A spokesman for Rachel Entwistle's family said members were "shocked by the news" of the charges against her husband. Neil was a trusted husband and father, and it is incomprehensible how that love and trust was betrayed in the ultimate act of violence," Joe Flaherty read from the family's statement. Flaherty said the family was "always confident that the case would be solved and those responsible would be brought to justice."

BNP spokesman Dr Phil Edwards said: "This is by no means a disastrous result and does not mean we are not welcome in Keighley.

In last year's general election, party leader Nick Griffin chose to stand in Keighley but received only 9% of the vote.

Tom DeLay will not seek re-election; to resign from Congress
FREE PREVIEW DeLay Won't Run For Re-Election To House Seat Word Count: 355 WASHINGTON -- Rep. Tom DeLay (R., Texas), once one of the most powerful Republicans on Capitol Hill, won't seek another term in Congress, former aides of Mr. DeLay and current House Republican leaders said last night. Mr. DeLay announced earlier this year that he wouldn't try to run for another term in the Republican leadership after he became the center of two separate investigations. Tom DeLay, the Texas republican representative and former House Majority Leader, and his wife, Christine, sat down at their kitchen table in Sugar Land, Texas, on Monday with TIME White House correspondent Mike Allen to explain DeLay's decision not to seek reelection, and to give up his Congressional seat in the next few months.

DeLay: After the primary [March 7], I started looking atreevaluating the primaryevaluating what the general election was going to be, looking at the landscape. I spent a lot of time talking to friends and people I have respect for and staffChristine and I every day discussing what the future holds. And I'm very proud of my record and I feel very strongly about what the 22nd District that I represent deserves. I spent a lot of time in prayer.

Swan in Fife, Scotland dies with H5N1 bird flu virus infection
More birds, including swans, are being tested The ex-head of the British Veterinary Association, Dr Bob McCracken, said he found it "difficult to accept" there would not be more cases. But Dr McCracken said that did not mean it was certain the virus would spread to poultry. He also advised poultry owners to keep birds indoors if possible. Seagulls Fourteen other birds, including 12 swans, are currently being tested by experts to see if they have the virus. I would start from the assumption that a small pool if wild birds in the Fife area are infected Dr Bob McCracken, British Veterinary Association Experts think there will be other positive cases, particularly because the initial case was in a mute swan, which is native to the UK, rather than a migratory species. Dr McCracken said: "I would start from the assumption that a small pool if wild birds in the Fife area are infected and potentially passing it on to other birds." "I don't think for a minute that will be the situation." Dr McCracken also warned that seagulls, who are known to have been pecking at the carcass of the dead bird, could also be infected. But he said measures - most significantly keeping birds indoors - would protect domestic flocks from becoming infected. And if infection did spread to a farm, containment measures could be implemented to prevent the virus spreading to other flocks - including culling.

Mr Blair said it was "a moment to let the process be governed, not by suspicion but by the faith that the other does want this to succeed."

Conservatives make gains in English local elections
With net gains of 316 seats, the Tories won control of councils such as Crawley, Ealing and Croydon. On the projected share of the votes if the local polls were held nationwide, the Conservatives were on 40%, ahead of the Lib Dems' 27% and Labour's 26%. Tory chairman Francis Maude called it a "good" result. But opponents said the Tories had failed in northern cities. 'Change and optimism' Mr Maude said the result was "at the top end" of predictions, adding: "We are continuing to build our support while Labour's melts away. "David Cameron's message of change, optimism and hope is in tune with what Britain wants today." It was the Tories' best local election performance since they last won national power in 1992. Party leader David Cameron said: "There's plenty more to do, and plenty more change to be made and work to be done, but I think this is a very important step forward." The party's win in Crawley stripped Labour of control of the town for the first time since the early 1970s. And the Tories picked up Ealing from Labour in what is seen as a "bellweather seat" for general election prospects.

Darfur rebel leader signs peace plan
The breakthrough came when SLM leader Minni Minnawi returned to the talks, following a late-night session. However, two smaller groups rejected the deal, following last-minute efforts to secure their support. The government has also agreed to sign. International negotiators say the deal is the best hope for peace in Darfur, where 2m people have fled their homes. The BBC's Alex Last, who is at the talks in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, says a huge round of applause was heard shortly after Mr Minnawi returned to the talks. "I accept the document with some reservations concerning the power sharing," Mr Minnawi said. DARFUR DRAFT PEACE PLAN Pro-government Janjaweed militia to be disarmed Rebel fighters to be incorporated into army One-off transfer of $300m to Darfur $200m a year for the region thereafter Compensation for those forced to flee their homes Regional government, if approved in a vote Q&A: Darfur crisis Have Your Say: Darfur crisis One of his officials told the Reuters news agency that the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLM) wanted more seats in parliament but had agreed to the deal to end the suffering of the people in Darfur. Meanwhile, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour has accused Sudan's government of offering "broad immunity" to members of the security forces involved in the Darfur violence and trying to minimise the scale of the problems. "The deal is peace - I think that the victory today is for Sudan," he said. However, a signing ceremony was delayed for three hours, as mediators try to persuade Abdelwahid Muhamed El Nur, leader of the smaller SLM faction, to sign up to the deal. Our correspondent says there are doubts as to whether the plan is workable, but the mediators are counting on the fact that they have managed to get the support of the largest rebel group. 'Misgivings' Sam Ibok, head of the AU mediation team, said the government thought the plan envisaged too many rebel fighters being integrated into the army. "They have great misgivings about the amendments and they say practical problems will arise in the implementation... but they don't want to give anybody grounds to continue the war," he said. About two million people have been displaced The smallest rebel group, the Justice and Equality Movement (Jem), insisted that it wanted fundamental changes to the document.

Sudan will welcome UN Peacekeepers in Darfur
Speaking from Darfur, Jan Egeland told the BBC there was a sea of militias in the region and without security the humanitarian work could not succeed. Mr Egeland is in Darfur, in western Sudan, to assess conditions there and in refugee camps in neighbouring Chad. He is to hold talks with the government in the capital, Khartoum, on Monday. The government and the biggest rebel group signed a peace deal on Friday. The agreement has raised hopes the government will allow UN peacekeepers to take over from African Union troops in the region. It has previously said it would only consider doing so if a peace deal was signed. Some 7,000 African Union troops are in the region - an area the size of France - but have struggled to contain the fighting.

He was speaking in the town of Gereida which is held by the rebel group which signed the peace deal, the Sudan Liberation Movement under Minni Minnawi. Tens of thousands of people around Gereida have been displaced in recent weeks, and the UN has warned of an impending disaster. Earlier, Mr Egeland held talks with the deputy governor of South Darfur in the town of Nyala and called for aid workers to be given unlimited access, as agreed in the peace deal. The peace plan, brokered by the African Union, creates a temporary regional government for Darfur, in which rebels will take part.

Theo Walcott is the big surprise in Eriksson's preliminary World Cup squad
Jol thinks Defoe should be in the squad Jol said: "I think it is amazing that Jermain is not in the squad. "But with the situation with Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen's fitness I still believe he will be in there." Another Spurs player, defender Ledley King, missed out through injury and Jol added: "It is all about fitness and he just got his injury at the wrong time." But England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson says King could still make the World Cup finals despite failing to even make his standby list. King is unfit after breaking a bone in his foot in April. I wasn't taking anything for granted but I was very hopeful of being included Darren Bent "If he is better then he might become an option. Bent, the top scoring Englishman in the Premiership this season with 18 goals, was not only left out of Eriksson's squad but also the standby list. "I wasn't taking anything for granted but I was very hopeful of being included. All I can do now is go away on holiday and recharge my batteries." Aaron (Lennon) is such an exciting talent Martin Jol Spurs coach And Jol said that their selection was reward for their hard work and endeavour during the season.

UK Attorney General says Guantanamo should close
The attorney general believes the camp should close He is reported to have serious doubts about whether the indefinite detention of "enemy combatants" is legal or fair. In a speech in London, he said the camp had become a symbol of injustice and its existence was "unacceptable". State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the US did not want to release people who might "end up on the battlefield" or commit terrorist acts. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has called the camp in Cuba an "anomaly". But in the strongest worded condemnation yet from a British government minister, Lord Goldsmith said: "The existence of Guantanamo remains unacceptable. The historic tradition of the United States as a beacon of freedom, liberty and of justice deserves the removal of this symbol Lord Goldsmith Transcript of speech in full Call shows 'significant shift' "It is time, in my view, that it should close. Not only would it, in my personal opinion, be right to close Guantanamo as a matter of principle, I believe it would also help to remove what has become a symbol to many - right or wrong - of injustice. "The historic tradition of the United States as a beacon of freedom, liberty and of justice deserves the removal of this symbol." Fair trial Lord Goldsmith told the Royal United Services Institute there was a case for limiting some rights for collective security. Fundamental rights must be protected if we are to preserve our democracies but given the current threat to our national security we have to be flexible Lord Goldsmith But he said the right to a fair trial should never be compromised. Lord Goldsmith said the UK was "unable to accept that the US military tribunals proposed for those detained at Guantanamo Bay offered sufficient guarantees of a fair trial in accordance with international standards".

USA Today reports NSA obtained call logs from communications companies
What author Malcolm Gladwell described as small things that make a big difference seems like an apt metaphor for the latest developments on civil liberties and the Bush administration. First was Thursday morning's story , declaring, "NSA Has Massive Database of Americans' Phone Calls." The story dominated the morning news shows and drove the day's events, with the President racing to the microphones in the Diplomatic Room of the White House before departing on a trip to Mississippi. Bush didn't get into the specifics of thestory, but he did defend the program, saying the federal government is not "mining or trolling through the personal lives of innocent Americans." To date, the Bush Administration has enjoyed public support for a slew of policies  including detentions without trials and new methods of eavesdropping  that critics describe as an encroachment on civil liberties. Last year, the Democrats tried to make renewal of the USA Patriot Act an issue, but in the end they buried their objections and passed a bill that Bush could sign. When the NSA's policy of warrantless eavesdropping on some domestic calls was revealed by The New York Times in December, Democrats along with many Republicans also screamed from the rafters, but the program proved popular with the public. Presidential advisers thought it was such a winner that they put it in Bush's State of the Union address. Despite calls to investigate the program and shut it down, what the White House dubs the "terrorist surveillance program" continued unabated. According to the story, the NSA is not actually listening in on the phone calls but monitoring the patterns of calls in a kind of giant Google search, with the hope that their algorithm will detect something untoward and worth investigating. But even if your call to Aunt Sally isn't being listened to by some NSA officer, the program sounds creepy enough that no shortage of senators jumped all over it. The Republican Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he'd subpoena the heads of the three telecommunications companies involved  AT&T, Verizon and BellSouth  before hearings to find out what they knew.

Finnish metal band win 51st Eurovision Song Contest
Lordi were a controversial choice for Eurovision And now Lordi have joined the likes of Abba, Bucks Fizz, Dana and Celine Dion on the elite list of Eurovision winners. This hard rock band were already successful in their home country, but have now become a phenomenon in Europe. That is partly thanks to their gloriously over-the-top theatrics and stadium rock anthems. But they may also have captured the imaginations of those who wanted to register a protest vote against Eurovision's normal diet of plastic pop. Their fearsome appearance and religious references led to some protests in Finland and host country Greece before this year's contest. Lordi say they will never remove their masks And a group of Greek protesters known as the Hellenes called on the Finnish government to intervene. "We ask the Finnish Commission of the Eurovision Song Contest to cancel the procedure and choose another song," they said. But Lordi's lead singer, also known as Lordi, brushed aside the complaints, insisting: "We have nothing to do with satan worshipping or anything like that - this is entertainment." "The guys behind the masks are not interesting - they walk the dogs," he said. The band have become Finland's first Eurovision winners Now 32, Putaansuu started drawing monster designs on his face with his mother's make-up at the age of seven and was making horror films with his parents' video camera three years later. They spent the first 10 years trying to get a record deal but their debut album Get Heavy went platinum in their home country in 2002 and their "greatest hits" compilation has been released in 20 countries.

British police shoot man in anti-terrorism raid
Police have cordoned off three roads in the area Residents' reactions The man, who was later arrested, was taken to hospital after the search in Forest Gate, east London. A 20-year-old man is also being held at a central London police station. A single shot was fired, according to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which will investigate. The operation was not linked to the London bombings of July 2005, police have said. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke, head of the Met's anti-terror branch, said the operation was planned in response to "specific intelligence". "Because of the very specific nature of the intelligence we planned an operation that was designed to mitigate any threat to the public either from firearms or from hazardous substances," he said. He said the purpose of the raid was to prove or disprove intelligence they had received. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford described it as the most significant anti-terror operation this year. The 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism as he was being treated at the Royal London hospital. Police officers in protective clothing have moved into the terraced house in Lansdown Road in what is being described as a "precautionary measure". The search of the premises is expected to take several days. A white and yellow tent has been set up outside the property, while workmen are erecting a two-storey high scaffolding screen around the building.

17 arrested in Canadian counter-terrorism operation
The arrest of 17people accused of planning attacks in southern Ontariotook on an international twist Saturday when theFBI said some Canadian suspects had been in contact with two men arrested by the U.S. on terrorism-related charges. The FBI said two men from Georgia visited Toronto last year and met at least three of the Canadians arrested late Friday night and accused of planning attacks in southern Ontario. FBI Special Agent Richard Kolko said U.S. authorities have been co-operating with Canadian police since the two Georgia men were arrested this spring on terrorism-related charges. The two were identified as Syed Ahmed, a 21-year-old student at the Georgia Institute for Technology and Ehsanul Sadequee, 19. A U.S. court affidavit said Ahmed and Sadequee travelled to Toronto in March 2005 to meet "like-minded Islamic extremists." It is believed they met with at least three Toronto residents to discuss training and tactics, leading to a major international investigation and the arrests on Friday. A U.S. affidavit obtained by Canadian Press quoted Ahmed as saying they"discussed strategic locations in the United States suitable for a terrorist strike, to include oil refineries and military bases. They also plotted how to disable the global positioning system in an effort to disrupt military and commercial communications and traffic." The affidavit alleges the group "developed a plan to receive military training at one of the several terrorist-sponsored training camps" and that Ahmed travelled to Pakistan for training. Sadequee was arrested in April in Bangladesh and is accused of making false statements in connection with a terrorism investigation. "We're lucky to have a robust partnership that mitigates many of the threats we face.

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed in airstrike
BAGHDAD, June 9 -- Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was clinging to life when Iraqi and, later, American forces arrived at the scene of the bombing that killed him, a U.S. general said Friday, revising his earlier account of the al-Qaeda leader's death. Meanwhile, other circumstances surrounding the killing remained cloudy. Zarqawi was lying on a stretcher at the scene of the bombing, in a village about 35 miles north of Baghdad, when U.S. forces arrived Wednesday evening and tentatively identified him as the wanted insurgent leader. He mumbled something indistinguishable and tried to move but was restrained, according to Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad. "Everybody re-secured him back onto the stretcher, but he died almost immediately thereafter from the wounds he'd received from this airstrike," Caldwell said. A day earlier, when asked about reports that Zarqawi had somehow survived the blast from two 500-pound bombs dropped by Air Force fighter jets, Caldwell had told reporters, "He was dead when we arrived there." In a video briefing for Pentagon reporters Friday, Caldwell also slightly adjusted earlier reports of who was killed in the bombing, saying that in addition to Zarqawi and his spiritual adviser, Sheik Abdel Rahman, another man and three women were among the dead but not a child, as he had first said. "I do know that if in fact U.S. military or coalition forces feel that, in the execution of a target, that it's going to lead to exorbitant American or coalition forces losses, that we'll use proportional force rather than put young men and women's lives at risk," Caldwell said. When reporters asked Caldwell how anyone could have survived such a bombardment, Caldwell said Air Force experts had assured him that it was possible.

U.S. military tribunals in Guantanamo Bay lack Congressional authorization, violate U.S. law and Geneva Conventions
Adjust font size: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday strongly limited the power of the Bush administration to conduct military tribunals for suspected terrorists imprisoned at the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The 5-3 ruling means officials will have to come up with a new policy to prosecute at least 10 so-called "enemy combatants" awaiting trial. It does not address the government's right to detain suspects. The case was a major test of President Bush's authority as commander in chief during war. Bush has aggressively asserted the power of the government to capture, detain and prosecute suspected terrorists in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001. (Watch analyst say administration has to start over -- 3:50) At the center of the dispute was a Yemeni man, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, captured in Afghanistan in 2001 shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Officials said he has admitted being a personal assistant, bodyguard and driver to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. "The military commission at issue is not expressly authorized by any congressional act," said Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority. The tribunals, he said, "must be understood to incorporate at least the barest of those trial protections that have been recognized by customary international law." "In undertaking to try Hamdan and subject him to criminal punishment, the executive [Bush] is bound to comply with the rule of law that prevails in this jurisdiction," Stevens wrote. "To the extent there is latitude to work with the Congress to determine whether or not the military tribunals will be an avenue in which to give people their day in court, we will do so," Bush said at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.

Interior Ministry, Fatah offices in Gaza hit by Israeli airstrikes
Israel targeted militants in Rafah in the latest air strikes The Palestinian interior ministry was hit, while a militant was reported killed in an air strike - the first fatality since the offensive began. Meanwhile the UN has warned of an imminent humanitarian crisis in Gaza. On Thursday Israel said it was postponing sending troops into northern Gaza to give diplomacy a chance. In an interview with the Egyptian newspaper al-Ahram, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said the Palestinian militant group Hamas had agreed to the conditional release of Cpl Gilad Shalit, who was captured on Sunday. "Up to now, the Israeli side does not accept," Mr Mubarak is quoted as saying, without giving details of the Palestinian conditions. 'All-out war' In the latest round of air strikes, Israeli warplanes fired missiles into the unoccupied Palestinian interior ministry in Gaza City shortly after midnight on Friday, setting the building ablaze. At least 20 other targets included an office of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah group, militant training camps, a weapons storage facility in Gaza City and sites used by militants to fire rockets at Israel. "Israel is now waging an open-ended all-out war against the Palestinian people that aims to topple the Palestinian presidency and the Palestinian government, and act as though there is no Palestinian official or government," he told the BBC. There were also reports of heavy exchanges of fire between militants and an undercover Israeli force near the northern town of Jabaliya. Humanitarian fears Meanwhile, the UN's emergency relief co-ordinator Jan Egeland said that Gaza was on the brink of a humanitarian crisis after the destruction by the Israeli air force of the only power plant there on Tuesday night.

Portugal taken to penalties; beat England and reach historic semi-final
Ricardo was the hero for Portugal with three penalty saves England lost skipper David Beckham to injury just after half-time and Wayne Rooney was sent off after 62 minutes for a stamp on Ricardo Carvalho. They battled on bravely for the rest of normal time and extra-time with 10 men to take the game to a shoot-out. But Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher missed to end their hopes and Sven-Goran Eriksson's reign. The Swede leaves his post as England coach after going out at the quarter-final stage of a major tournament for the third time in succession and now hands over to Steve McClaren. Eriksson had promised a big performance from his side but until Rooney's early exit it was not forthcoming. The young striker endured a frustrating game and his patience finally snapped as he got tangled up with Carvalho and Armando Petit and appeared to aim a stamp at the Chelsea player's groin. Elizondo took a moment before sending Rooney from the field and with him seemingly went England's World Cup hopes. Portugal were far from their best but they at least caused some worrying moments at the back for England in a tense first half. A deep Luis Figo free-kick was not dealt with by Gary Neville or Lampard and there was huge relief for England to see Tiago slip with the goal at his mercy. Tiago almost caused further problems when he was given a free header in the box that Paul Robinson clambered across to save. Eriksson was forced to change things round six minutes into the second half with Beckham struggling with an ankle problem. Beckham almost won a penalty with his last contribution of the game - and probably his chances of winning a World Cup - when his cross hit the hand of Nuno Valente but England's appeals came to nothing. Rooney saw red after 62 minutes for stamping on Carvalho Lennon's introduction gave England brief hope as his pace took him past two players, but when the ball fell for Rooney he almost completely missed and Joe Cole's effort was just too high.

The US called the tests "provocative", and urged a resumption of multilateral talks. Japan went on to announce a range of sanctions against Pyongyang. The ambassadors of the US, Japan and the UK said there had been widespread concern with not a single member of the council defending North Korea's actions. A draft resolution drawn up by Japan and the US is said to demand that Pyongyang immediately stop the development, testing and deployment of ballistic missiles. It also calls on member states to prevent the transfer of resources, items and technology that could contribute to North Korea's missile programme. Experts are beginning discussion on the document but there is no indication when it may be passed by the council.

The age of the victim is not known. While the FBI estimated her to be 25, a neighbour said she was 14. His honourable discharge from the army is not related to the crime, prosecutors said, but was "due to a personality disorder." His case is being handled in the civilian courts because he is no longer on active military duty. Conspiracy alleged The affidavit said Green and three fellow soldiers were posted to a traffic checkpoint in the town of Mahmoudiya —south of Baghdad —when they conspired to rape the young woman.

Several blasts rock Mumbai commuter trains
Rescue efforts have been hampered by heavy rain The first of the near-simultaneous blasts went off at about 1830 local time (1300 GMT), during the rush hour in the suburbs on the Western Railway. Correspondents spoke of scenes of pandemonium, with people jumping from trains and bodies flung onto tracks. There have been a number of bomb attacks in Mumbai in recent years. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for calm and described the incidents as a "shocking and cowardly attempt to spread a feeling of hatred". Pakistani leaders also condemned the blasts as a "despicable act of terrorism". Police said the co-ordinated blasts took place at Matunga, Khar, Mahim, Jogeshwari, Borivali and Bhayandar, with most on moving trains and two at stations. A shopkeeper near one explosion said it was so powerful they thought they had been hit by lightning. Television images show dazed and bloodied commuters being carried by fellow passengers to waiting ambulances, as rescue workers clambered through wreckage to reach victims. The force of the blasts ripped doors and windows off carriages, and scattered luggage. An eyewitness at Mahim told the BBC some of those who had jumped from the train were run over by another train coming in the opposite direction. Hospitals across Mumbai have been swamped with casualties. A medical student at a hospital in Parel, which has received many of the wounded, told the BBC News website the "floors are filled with bloodstains".

Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett dies at age 60
share tweet email A little bit of rock mythology died with Syd Barrett, the psychically damaged founding member of Pink Floyd who apparently succumbed to complications from diabetes last Friday at age 60.Every creative discipline has its unstable geniuses – poets, painters, actors. Some of them play the role to the hilt, with a mad leer and an arched eyebrow. Others, like Barrett, aren’t acting at all. Rock music, with its crazy energy and relentless search for the new, has always been an especially apt breeding ground for wayward types. Syd Barrett, a true manchild tuned to another frequency, created the mold. There were, to be sure, earlier examples of beguiling, irrational behavior in rock. But the psychedelic era brought a new strangeness to popular music, and Barrett was one of the most prominent early acid casualties. A key founding member of Pink Floyd, who gave the group its name (borrowed from the bluesmen Pink Anderson and Floyd Council) and wrote most of the band’s debut album, “The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,” Barrett was forced to quit by early 1968. After cobbling together two fragile but enduring solo albums, “The Madcap Laughs” and “Barrett” (both released in 1970), the frequently incoherent singer frittered away the rest of his years in his mum’s house in Cambridge, England. Occasionally spotted on long walks or errands to the corner store, he was the subject of much armchair speculation: Was he an undiagnosed schizophrenic?

Blair ally Lord Levy arrested
Lord Levy is a close friend of Tony Blair Lord Levy, 61, denies any wrongdoing and accused the police of using their arrest powers "totally unnecessarily". The peer was one of the key figures in the securing of multi-million pound loans to the Labour Party last year. Police are examining whether honours were ever given as reward for financial help to any of the three main parties. Critics of Mr Blair have seized on news of the arrest as Lord Levy is a close ally and tennis partner of the prime minister, as well as his Middle East envoy. Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond claimed the water was now "lapping around the prime minister's feet". 'No offence' Scotland Yard is conducting a wide-ranging investigation into loans and donations made to all three parties to see if there is any evidence that honours have been given as rewards for financial help. It is ludicrous for the prime minister to refuse to comment on the basis that this is a party matter Norman Baker Lib Dem MP Analysis: How bad for Blair? A police spokesman confirmed a man had been arrested and questioned about possible infringements of honours and election laws. Lord Levy's spokesman said: "He has not been charged and does not expect to be, as he has committed no offence." His spokesman added: "Lord Levy has made it clear that he is ready at all times to co-operate with the police investigation. The prime minister's official spokesman said he could not comment on Lord Levy's arrest because it was a party, not a government, matter.

Psilocybin induces mystical and spiritual experiences: study
Psilocybin, the active ingredient of "magic mushrooms," expands the mind. The chemical promoted a mystical experience in two-thirds of people who took it for the first time, according to a new study. One-third rated a session with psilocybin as the "single most spiritually significant" experience of their lives. The study, published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology, is the first randomized, controlled trial of a substance used for centuries in Mexico and Central America to produce mystical insights. Almost no research on a psychedelic drug in human subjects has been done in this country since the 1960s. It confirms what both shamans and hippies have long said -- taking psilocybin is a scary, reality-bending and occasionally life-changing experience. The researchers say they hope the experiment opens a door to the study of a class of compounds that alter human perception and erode the boundaries of self -- at least in some users. They hope it will provide new insight into how the brain works and what neurochemical events underlie moments of mystical rapture. If the generally positive effects of the drug are confirmed by other studies, the research is likely to raise the question of whether people should be allowed access to psilocybin for self-improvement or recreation. Rigorous study of these substances has been shunned since the 1960s, although it is not legally prohibited. Research on them was a casualty of the muddled mix of science and advocacy by people like Timothy Leary, the LSD guru and former Harvard psychologist once called the "most dangerous man in America" by President Richard M. Nixon. "There is a clear neuroscience agenda to understand those effects, and clear clinical applications that could be pursued."

Day of attacks continue in Israel and Lebanon
Israeli warplanes hit Beirut suburb Israel attacks airports, major highway after Hezbollah lobs rockets QUICKVOTE Do you think the Israeli military response inside Lebanon is justified? Yes No or View Results YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Israel Lebanon or or Create Your Own JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israeli warplanes early Friday bombed southern Beirut, home to the offices of Hezbollah and the group's leader, as the Israeli-Lebanese violence that has killed dozens of Lebanese civilians and 10 Israelis entered its third day. Lebanese police said the planes hit the airport road, which crosses through the southern district considered a Hezbollah stronghold. A Lebanese army official said bombs also hit two bridges in the southern suburbs of the capital and a stadium. Earlier, Israel had dropped leaflets warning residents to stay away from the Hezbollah offices in southern Beirut, where Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah is thought to live. Rockets also landed in the northern port city of Haifa, which would mark the deepest point into Israel that Hezbollah rockets have ever reached, but Hezbollah denied that they fired the rockets. An Israeli diplomat called the rocket attacks "a major escalation" in the violence. Israeli airstrikes and artillery hammered hundreds of targets in Lebanon, including two strikes on the Beirut airport, where helicopter gunships left craters in runways and turned fuel tanks into fireballs. (Watch the strike on Beirut's airport -- :44) Israel said it targeted the airport because it is a transfer point for weapons and supplies to Hezbollah. Despite the fact that several countries -- including the Unites States and Lebanon -- have said that the Lebanese government doesn't have the capacity to extend its authority into Hezbollah-held territory, Israel has blamed the Lebanese government for the violence and charged it with the soldiers' safe release.

Hezbollah-Israel conflict continues
Israeli strikes are targeting Lebanese infrastructure Enlarge Image  Warplanes fired rockets on the Lebanon-Syrian border and hit the centre of Beirut for the first time. More than 80 Lebanese have died, including 18 fleeing border areas, in the strikes launched after Hezbollah militants seized two Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah launched rockets on the town of Tiberias in the deepest such attack in Israel. Israel has deployed Patriot interceptor missiles in the northern port city of Haifa which was hit by rockets earlier. One Israeli soldier was killed and three were missing from a warship struck by Hezbollah on Friday. In an emotional appeal on Lebanese television, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora called for an immediate ceasefire and urged the US to intervene. "Lebanon is a disaster zone... and (it) pleads to its friends in the world to rush to its aid," he said. Following emergency talks in Egypt, Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa said the Middle East peace process had failed and urged the UN Security Council to tackle the crisis.

Labour peer tells Blair to step down as Prime Minister
Lord Hattersley says Gordon Brown should be the next Labour leader He said any tenure in Downing Street beyond this year's Labour conference would damage the party. Last week left-wing backbencher John McDonnell, Hayes and Harlington MP, said he would run for the Labour leadership when Tony Blair stands down. But Lord Hattersley said Chancellor Gordon Brown was the "ideal" candidate to take over the reins of the party. 'High note' "The prime minister ought not to announce he's going at party conference - he ought to go at party conference," the Labour peer told GMTV's Sunday Programme. Mr Blair said he did not want constant speculation over the timing of his resignation. "I'm not sitting there, you know, obsessing the entire time about when the precise date is and all the rest of it. Get on with the job, that's what the public want and we are," he told BBC One's Politics Show. I think what the Labour Party needs to win the next election is a solemn, serious, if you like, son of the manse Lord Hattersley Blair defiant over departure date Mr Hattersley said Mr Blair should point to Labour's achievements since coming to power in 1997, pass the leadership baton to his successor and "thank the party for what they've done". "The longer he stays on the more damaging it is for him as well as the party in my view." He also said that if Mr Blair stayed until 2007, it would be "impossible to put new life" into the party.

Despite 6 warnings Israel bombed and killed 4 UN observers
 » Special Report | Video archive | E-mail us: Your stories | How to help civilians  U.N.: Observers made many calls before strike Annan, China condemn attack that killed 4 YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Israel Lebanon Hezbollah or or Create Your Own BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- The U.N. observers killed when an Israeli bomb hit their bunker in Lebanon Tuesday called an Israeli military liaison about 10 times in the six hours before they died to warn that aerial attacks were getting close to their position, a U.N. officer said. After each call, the Israeli officer promised to have the bombing stopped, an officer at the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) base in Noqoura said. As of Wednesday morning, three of the four bodies had been recovered from the rubble, an officer at the UNIFIL base in Noqoura said. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said the incident would be "thoroughly investigated" and that the Israeli military had taken measures since the start of its bombardment of southern Lebanon to protect the U.N. observers there. Annan issued a sharply worded statement Tuesday evening which said he was "shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting ... of a U.N. observer post in southern Lebanon." He called on Israel to conduct "a full investigation into this very disturbing incident." "This coordinated artillery and aerial attack on a long established and clearly marked U.N. post at Khiyam occurred despite personal assurances given to me by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that U.N. positions would be spared Israeli fire," Annan said. The timeline provided CNN by a U.N. officer in Lebanon showed the first bomb exploded about 200 yards from the U.N. outpost at 1:20 p.m. Tuesday, prompting the first call by the UNIFIL observers to their designated contact with the Israeli military. A series of about nine more bombs hit within 100 to 400 yards from the observers over the next several hours, with a call to the Israeli military following each explosion.

Colombia's Uribe sworn in to second term as president
BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 7 -- President Alvaro Uribe began a second term Monday, promising to seek an elusive peace with leftist rebels while maintaining the hard-line security policies credited with a sharp drop in murder and kidnappings. In an inauguration ceremony attended by 11 heads of state, Uribe said he would devote "all of his energies" to pursuing a peaceful end to this nation's four-decade-old civil war. "I'm not afraid of negotiating peace," Uribe, 54, said after taking the oath of office. "I confess what worries me more is falling short of that goal and instead seeing our gains in security eroded." After reforming the constitution last year to allow himself to seek a second term, Uribe coasted to victory in the May 28 elections with 62 percent of the vote -- 10 percentage points more than he won in 2002. He is Colombia's first sitting president to be reelected. Despite his reputation as a free-market conservative and Washington's closest ally in Latin America, Uribe at times in his speech sounded like the left-leaning social democrats favored of late by voters in neighboring countries. "We are against a fiscally tight macro-economic policy that leaves economic growth to the luck of supply and demand. Uribe made no bold proposals for improving the lot of the 50 percent of Colombians who live below the poverty line -- on less than three U.S. dollars a day -- even as the rich benefit from the increased foreign investment that improved security has brought. Uribe has taken a hard line against terrorism and drug trafficking Before presidents and officials from more than 20 countries, he pledged to seek peace with left-wing rebels and improve the country's economy.

Police in Britain uncover suspected terrorist plot
All airports have been put under the restrictions Reid statement It is thought the plan was to detonate explosive devices smuggled in hand luggage on to as many as 10 aircraft. Police are searching premises after 21 people were arrested. Home Secretary John Reid said they believed the "main players" were accounted for. High security is causing delays at all UK airports. The threat level to the UK has been raised by MI5 to critical after the arrests in London, High Wycombe and Birmingham. Critical threat level - the highest - means "an attack is expected imminently and indicates an extremely high level of threat to the UK".

North Korea reportedly planning nuclear bomb test
S. Korea: No evidence of North nuke test SEOUL (AP)  South Korea said Friday it has no clear evidence that communist North Korea is preparing for a nuclear test, responding to a news report citing a U.S. official saying intelligence showed possible signs of an upcoming test. "I haven't heard that we have confirmed clear evidence that North Korea is pursuing a nuclear test," Unification Minister Lee Jong-seok told lawmakers at a committee hearing. Lee said there is frequent speculation about the North's nuclear program, but that not all of it turns out to be true. "We are closely monitoring North Korea's activities related to the nuclear program and missiles," he said. The United States and South Korea "share all intelligence and evaluations" related to North Korean movements, Lee told The Associated Press. "We cannot specifically confirm the report as it is an intelligence matter," a spokesman said on condition of anonymity, citing policy. The comments came after ABC News quoted an unidentified State Department official as saying a North Korean nuclear test was "a real possibility." The report also cited an unidentified senior U.S. military official as saying that a U.S. intelligence agency recently had seen "suspicious vehicle movement" at a suspected test site, including the unloading of reels of cable outside an underground facility in northeast North Korea. The White House declined to confirm the report, but an official there who refused to be identified said Washington's position was that a "North Korean nuclear test would be an extremely provocative action that would draw universal condemnation from the international community."

Case against Karr dropped: no DNA link to JonBenet Ramsey murder
Mr Karr had told reporters JonBenet's death was an accident The case against John Mark Karr was dropped after forensic tests found that his DNA did not match that discovered at the scene of the crime. Mr Karr, 41, was arrested in Thailand two weeks ago and had been due to appear in court on Monday. He has said he was there when the girl died, but her death was an accident. But outside court in Colorado on Monday public defender Seth Temin said in a statement: "The warrant on Mr Karr has been dropped by the district attorney. They're not proceeding with this case. "We're deeply distressed by the fact that they took this man and dragged him here from Bangkok, Thailand with no forensic evidence confirming the allegations against him, and no independent factors leading to a presumption that he did anything wrong." However, Mr Karr is still in police custody, following a request that he be taken to California to face child pornography charges dating back to 2001. 'No forensic evidence' Mr Karr's arrest sparked hopes in the United States that one of the most infamous crimes of recent years might finally be solved.

27 die from pipeline explosion in Diwaniya, Iraq
The oil pipeline explosion caused a huge fire A police spokesman said people had been siphoning fuel from the pipeline in an industrial zone south of Diwaniya, 130km (80 miles) south of Baghdad. Casualty reports varied widely - one put the death toll at 74. In a separate development, police found more than 20 bodies at two sites in Baghdad. Officials say the cause of the blast in Diwaniya is still being investigated. Witnesses told Reuters the explosion happened at about 2300 local time (1900 GMT) on Monday, when a large group of people were taking fuel from two pools. A unnamed police source quoted by Reuters news agency said 50 people had been killed, while AFP quoted a health official saying 74 died. "Some of the wounded have burns on 75% of their bodies," Hamid Jaafi, a health official in Diwaniya told Reuters. Government officials said the pipeline, which used to carry petrol to the capital, had been out of operation since 2003. But a defence ministry official said it still held residues of fuel and residents often cut holes in it to siphon off petrol, which is in short supply despite Iraq's wealth of oil deposits.

Second in command of al-Qaeda in Iraq in custody
Zarqawi Lieutenant Arrested in Iraq An Iraqi government official says al-Qaida in Iraq's second in command has been captured. Iraq's National Security Adviser Mufaq al-Rubaie told reporters Sunday that Hamed Farid al-Saeedi was arrested a few days ago. Al-Saeedi is reportedly the mastermind behind the February bombing of a Shia shrine in Samarra. Images of the shattered gold dome of the shrine sparked the wave of sectarian violence that has Iraq on the verge of a full-scale civil war. "Under the orders of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi," he said, "al-Saeedi planned the bombing to ignite a civil war between Sunnis and Shi'ites." In addition to the bombing, al-Saeedi is believed to have planned and carried out countless kidnappings, bombings and assassinations. Working on intelligence gained after the death of Zarqawi, Hamed al-Saeedi was tracked down to a house in Tikrit, where he was reportedly found hiding behind women and children. Rubaie also said this successful raid shows the capability and professionalism of Iraq's security forces and intelligence operations. U.S. military sources confirmed to NPR the capture of al-Saeedi and his status as the deputy commander of al-Qaida in Iraq. Saedi is accused of ordering the Samarra shrine's destruction Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffaq al-Rubaie, told a news conference the man, Hamad Jama al-Saedi, was detained a few days ago.

British PM Tony Blair pressured by resignations
Mr Blair is being urged to make a public announcement He branded ex-junior minister Tom Watson, the most senior person to quit, "disloyal, discourteous and wrong" for signing a letter urging him to go. The resignations came as Mr Blair faces growing pressure to name a departure date or even quit now. 'Brownite plot' But Mr Blair's supporters claim the calls for him to quit are an orchestrated plot by supporters of Mr Brown, who has so far declined to comment on the furore. In a statement, former Home Secretary David Blunkett said: "It is now in Gordon Brown's - and the Labour Party's - best interests for those seeking the prime minister's immediate departure to back off. "This is not only to avoid our opponents exploiting the impression of disintegration and division, but also to avoid the split of our party, which would have lasting consequences. "No-one can benefit from a split in the government or the party now, or in the foreseeable future, and this is patently avoidable by a return to common sense." 'Clear timetable' Mr Watson and the six parliamentary private secretaries (PPSs) - who are unpaid ministerial aides at the bottom rung of the government ladder - were among a number of normally loyal Labour MPs from the 2001 intake who signed a letter calling on Mr Blair to quit. Without an urgent change in the leadership of the party it becomes less likely that we will win that election Loyal Labour MPs urge Blair to quit In full: 2001 intake letter The six were: Khalid Mahmood, Wayne David, Ian Lucas, Mark Tami, Chris Mole and David Wright. In a joint statement, four of the PPS group said Mr Blair had "not ended the uncertainty over when you intend to leave office, which is damaging the government and the party". Mr David told BBC Radio 5 Live he was worried about next year's elections in Scotland and Wales, adding: "We obviously will do much better if we have a clear timetable set out for transition". Mr Watson, who has already been replaced as a junior defence minister by junior transport minister Derek Twigg, said he no longer believed that it was in the best interests of the party or the country for Mr Blair to continue.

Pope apologises in person for the reaction to his comments
The Pope said he wanted to clarify the true meaning of his address He said the medieval text which he quoted did not express in any way his personal opinion, adding the speech was an invitation to respectful dialogue. Some Muslim leaders said his statement was sufficient to defuse the row, but others said it did not go far enough. The 14th Century Christian emperor's quote said the Prophet Muhammad brought the world only evil and inhuman things. The Pope has been under intense scrutiny amid angry reactions from throughout the Muslim world. I hope this serves to appease hearts and to clarify the true meaning of my address, which in its totality was and is an invitation to frank and sincere dialogue, with mutual respect Pope Benedict XVI Text of Pope's apology Excerpts from original speech Turkey's most senior Muslim religious figure, Ali Bardakoglu, welcomed the Pope's statement, and described his respect for Islam as a "civilised position". But State Minister Mehmet Aydin said the pontiff appeared to be saying he was sorry for the outrage but not necessarily the remarks themselves. "You either have to say this 'I'm sorry' in a proper way or not say it at all - are you sorry for saying such a thing or because of its consequences?"

"I am deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address at the University of Regensburg, which were considered offensive to the sensibility of Muslims," he told pilgrims. Several West Bank churches have been attacked "I hope this serves to appease hearts and to clarify the true meaning of my address, which in its totality was and is an invitation to frank and sincere dialogue, with mutual respect."

French newspaper suggests Osama bin Laden may be dead
AP General Michael Hayden, Director of the CIA, walked into the celebration of Saudi Arabia's national day in Washington D.C. and was immediately posed with the question of the day. "Nope," Hayden said, immediately adding to the accumulating statements on the paucity of evidence that Osama bin Laden was dead. About an hour before, the Saudi government itself declared that it "has no evidence to support recent media reports that Osama bin Laden is dead. Information that has been reported otherwise is purely speculative and cannot be independently verified." Pakistani intelligence sources, who monitor the mountainous regions where Bin Laden is believed to be hiding out, had also dismissed the reports of the terror leader's death. A well placed source in Washington said the idea of Bin Laden's demise appears to have originated as a "hypothesis of some Saudi intelligence analysts with no hard evidence to back it up. No one at a high level is satisfied it's true." At his country's national day celebration in Washington, Saudi Ambassador Prince Turki al-Faisal said, "My understanding is that [Bin Laden] is alive and well and kicking. Earlier on Saturday, the French newspaper L'Est Republicain cited a report by the French intelligence service, Direction Generale des Services Exteriors (DGSE), saying that Saudi intelligence officials "seem to have become convinced that Osama bin Laden is dead." The report quoted by the newspaper said the Saudis believe bin Laden "might have succumbed to a very serious case of typhoid fever resulting in partial paralysis of his lower limbs while in Pakistan on August 23, 2006." Echoing that report, a Saudi source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told TIME that Saudi officials have received multiple reports over the last several weeks that Bin Laden has been suffering from a water-borne illness.

IRA disbands military structure
The report said some IRA members remain involved in crime Monitors' statement He was speaking after the Independent Monitoring Commission said the IRA had changed radically and some of its most important structures were dismantled. The prime minister said politicians now had a "unique opportunity" to reach a "final settlement". Out of the IMC's 12 reports so far, it is its most positive report about IRA activities to date. READ THE REPORT Independent Monitoring Commission 12th report [912KB] Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here The report indicates that a number of key parts of the IRA's structure have been dismantled or substantially reduced. Mr Blair said there was "now a consensus across all main players in the politics of Northern Ireland, that change can only come through persuasion and not through violence of any sort". "The IRA has done what we asked it to do, and while issues like policing remain to be solved, the door is now open to a final settlement, which is why the talks next week in Scotland are going to be so important." "That doesn't mean that criminal activity by all members has stopped but the leadership has made public statements and internal directions, investigated incidents of breach of the policy, even expelled some members and has emphasised the importance of ensuring that business affairs are conducted in a legitimate way," he said. "If the police question is settled absolutely on a democratic basis and principle we would have come a long way along the road," he said.

US court indicts man for treason
Adam Gadahn, the first American charged with treason in more than 50 years. (Associated Press) An American citizen was charged with treason Wednesday for the first time since just after the Second World War. Justice Department in Washington announced the charges against 28-year-old Adam Gadahn, who is alleged to have appeared in several videos made in support of al-Qaeda. Gadahn is from California but officials say he is neither in the United States nor in U.S. custody. The FBI says Gadahn was originally known as Adam Pearlman but changed his name when he converted to Islam at the age of 17. His nom de guerre is said to be Azzam the American. In a video posted on a militant Islamic website last month, Gadahn is said to have called for U.S. President George W. Bush to repent his actions and toaccept the Muslim faith. A video released in July allegedly features Gadahn praising those who kill Western troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The FBI says it has been seeking to question Gadahn for nearly two years. Story Highlights • NEW: Gadahn placed on most-wanted list; $1 million reward offered • Californian first American charged with treason since World War II era • Gadahn, 28, appealed to Americans in al Qaeda videos • Nicknamed "Azzam the American," he hailed 9/11 hijackers in video Adjust font size: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An American al Qaeda propagandist was indicted Wednesday on treason charges, the first person charged with the offense during the United States' war on terrorism, officials said. Adam Yahiye Gadahn, who has appeared in five al Qaeda videos, is also charged with offering material support for terrorism, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty said. He has been put on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list, and the State Department is offering a $1 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction.

Gag order imposed on Guantanamo whistleblower
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A paralegal and a military lawyer who brought forward allegations about prisoner abuse at the Guantanamo Bay detention center have been ordered not to speak with the press, lawyers and a military spokeswoman said Saturday. Marine Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, who represents a detainee at the U.S. naval base in eastern Cuba, filed a complaint with the Pentagon last week alleging that abuse was ongoing at the prison. Heather Cerveny, in which she said several Guantanamo guards bragged in a bar about beating detainees, describing it as common practice. Muneer Ahmad, a civilian defense lawyer for Omar Khadr, a Canadian detainee whose military counsel is Vokey, said that Vokey and Cerveny were ordered Friday by the U.S. Marines not to speak with the press. A spokeswoman for the Marines confirmed the order, saying Vokey's supervisor _ Col. Carol Joyce, the Marines' chief defense counsel _ had directed him not to communicate with the media "pending her review of the facts." "This is necessary to ensure all actions of counsel are in compliance with regulations establishing professional standards for military attorneys," the spokeswoman, 1st Lt. Blanca E. Binstock, said in a statement. Reached by telephone, Vokey declined to comment, saying, "I can't even talk about it." He said he didn't know how the order was issued and that Vokey previously had the military's authorization to speak with the media. "I think he is very concerned about his ability to perform his job as a lawyer," Ahmad said. "It's really quite troubling ... at this point I'm not sure what our next steps will be." Cerveny, 23, visited Guantanamo last month and has said she spent an hour with the guards at the military club.

2006 U.S. Congressional Elections
Some glitches reported as voters turn out for midterm elections WASHINGTON  Millions of voters, including President Bush, began voting today for critical midterm elections, but voting machine glitches in at least three states caused some jangled nerves and early delays. At stake are all 435 House seats, 33 Senate seats and governorships in 36 states in an election that will set the tone and agenda for the final two years of Bush's second term. As polls opened across the country, electronic voting machine problems frazzled voters and election workers in dozens of precincts. Voting was delayed in Indiana and Ohio, while in Florida some election officials had little choice but to turn to paper ballots instead. In Cleveland, voters rolled their eyes as poll workers fumbled with new voting machines that they couldn't get to start properly. "We got five machines — one of them's got to work," said Willette Scullank, a trouble shooter from the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, elections board. Election officials in Delaware County, Ind., planned to seek a court order to extend voting after an apparent computer error prevented voters from casting ballots in 75 precincts. "We are working with precincts one-by-one over the telephone to get the problem fixed," Wenger said. In the Jacksonville suburb of Orange Park, voters were forced to use paper ballots after an electronic machine broke. With voting underway, the key question is whether Democrats can take advantage of national dissatisfaction with Bush and the war in Iraq to win the 15 seats they need to control the House of Representatives and six seats they need to take the Senate.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld resigns
President Bush emerged from an election in which his party took what he described as a "thumping" and ousted Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld yesterday, saying that a "fresh perspective" is needed to guide the military through the difficult war in Iraq. Speaking at a White House news conference the day after Democrats took control of the House of Representatives, and possibly the Senate, an apparently chastened and conciliatory Bush said he was nominating former CIA director Robert M. Gates to replace the long-embattled Rumsfeld. After six years of a presidency that has been about drawing lines against the Democrats and taunting them as weak, Bush presented a sharp about-face in an appearance in the White House East Room. "What's changed today is the election is over," he said, "and the Democrats won." Acknowledging that the elections amounted to a rebuke of Republican leadership, Bush said voters had signaled they wanted cooperation and problem-solving in Washington. If anything, he seemed to greet defeat with an air of relief, as though the results had allowed him to abandon an all-is-well pretense that was increasingly at odds with his actual political circumstances. He said that he had begun to contemplate Rumsfeld's exit before the election -- even while he was publicly vowing that he would keep the defense secretary through the end of his term and insisting that polls forecasting Republican defeat were wrong. "I thought we were going to do fine yesterday," Bush insisted. Rumsfeld understood as well as he did, Bush said, that "Iraq is not working well enough, fast enough." Beyond the switch at the Pentagon, White House aides in recent weeks developed an agenda designed to attract bipartisan support, including an increase in the minimum wage -- a longtime Democratic priority -- as well as comprehensive immigration legislation, energy measures, and the extension of the No Child Left Behind education program. "The American people want their leaders in Washington to set aside partisan differences, conduct ourselves in an ethical manner, and work together to address the challenges facing our nation."

Rumsfeld memo recognizes need for 'major adjustment' in Iraq
“Recast the U.S. military mission and the U.S. goals (how we talk about them) — go minimalist,” he added. The memo suggests frustration with the pace of turning over responsibility to the Iraqi authorities; in fact, the memo calls for examination of ideas that roughly parallel troop withdrawal proposals presented by some of the White House’s sharpest Democratic critics. (Text of the Memo) Advertisement Continue reading the main story The memo’s discussion of possible troop reduction options offers a counterpoint to Mr. Rumsfeld’s frequent public suggestions that discussions about force levels are driven by requests from American military commanders. It also puts on the table several ideas for troop redeployments or withdrawals, even as there have been recent pronouncements from American commanders emphasizing the need to maintain troop levels for the time being. The memorandum sometimes has a finger-wagging tone, as Mr. Rumsfeld says that the Iraqis must “pull up their socks,” and suggests that reconstruction aid should be withheld in violent areas to avoid rewarding “bad behavior.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Other options called for shrinking the number of bases, establishing benchmarks that would mark the Iraqis’ progress toward political, economic and security goals and conducting a “reverse embeds” program to attach Iraqi soldiers to American squads. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The memo was finished one day after President Bush interviewed Robert M. Gates, the president of Texas A&M University, as a potential successor to Mr. Rumsfeld and one day before the midterm elections. By then it was clear that the Republicans appeared likely to suffer a setback at the polls and that the administration was poised to begin reconsidering its Iraq strategy. It is unclear whether he knew at that point that he was about to be replaced, though the White House has said that Mr. Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld had a number of conversations on the matter. Told that The New York Times had obtained a copy of it, a Pentagon spokesman, Eric Ruff, confirmed its authenticity. “As it became clear that people were considering options for the way forward, the secretary had some views on the subject, and this memo reflects those views,” he said. At the Pentagon, Mr. Rumsfeld has been famous for his “snowflakes” — memos that drift down to the bureaucracy from on high and that are used to ask questions, stimulate debate and shape policy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Unlike the lawyerly memo on Iraq policy submitted Nov. 8 by Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, Mr. Rumsfeld’s listed more than a dozen “illustrative options” that the defense secretary did not endorse, but suggested merited serious consideration. “Many of these options could, and in a number of cases, should be done in combination with others,” Mr. Rumsfeld advised.

Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk receives Nobel Prize
By Sarah Rainsford BBC News, Istanbul  Pamuk is one of the youngest writers to have won the prize "Our Pride," is the headline in Radikal. "It's very important, I congratulate him," says bookseller Mehmet, who moved all his Pamuk stock to the front of the store as soon as he heard that the first ever Turk had won the Nobel Prize for Literature. "It's not only Orhan Pamuk who's won here. This prize will be a chance for all the world to get to know Turkish literature." Each of his books had sold more than 115,000 copies here at home. He has been translated into dozens of foreign languages - and demand is now soaring. In the first four hours after the news from Sweden, Pamuk's publishers in Istanbul received another 6,000 orders. 'Western plot' Earlier this year nationalist groups labelled the author a traitor when he spoke out on two of Turkey's most sensitive issues - claims that Ottoman Turks committed genocide against the Armenians nine decades ago, and the plight of ethnic Kurds in modern-day Turkey.

U.S. Senator Tim Johnson hospitalized
Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson of South Dakota was hospitalized Wednesday, weeks before his party was to take control of the Senate by a one-vote margin. But by evening, his condition was unclear, with conflicting reports over whether he had suffered a stroke. The one thing that appeared to be true was that Johnson had some undiagnosed illness that has left him with difficulty speaking and moving. Johnson, who turns 60 on Dec. 28, was admitted to George Washington University Hospital, said Julianne Fisher, Johnson's communications director. The illness was initially thought to be a stroke. Fisher later said, however, that Johnson did not suffer a stroke or heart attack. In a statement late Wednesday, Fisher said, "Senator Johnson continues to undergo testing and procedures at George Washington University Hospital. We expect to have more information in the morning." Admiral John Eisold, attending physician of the U.S. Capitol, issued a statement saying Johnson was admitted to the hospital "with the symptoms of a stroke." While many on Capitol Hill voiced frustration about the lack of immediate information, aides noted the senator promptly received medical attention after feeling ill earlier in the day. Johnson became disoriented during a conference call with reporters at midday Wednesday, stuttering in response to a question.

Saddam Hussein executed by hanging
When Sgt Ellis left, Saddam Hussein said he would be his brother In an interview with a US newspaper, Master Sgt Robert Ellis provided a rare glimpse into the last years of Saddam Hussein, who was executed on Saturday. Sgt Ellis looked after the former Iraqi leader - whom they called 'Victor' - in 2004 and 2005 at a camp near Baghdad. The prisoner rarely complained during his time in captivity, he said. He added that he was under strict orders to do whatever necessary to keep Saddam alive. "Saddam Hussein cannot die in US custody," he said a US colonel had told him. 'Coping skills' Sgt Ellis, from St Louis, told the St Louis Post-Dispatch that Saddam Hussein was held in a six foot by eight foot (1.8m to 2.4m) cell with a cot, table, two plastic chairs and two wash basins. In fact, I was there to help him, and he respected that Robert Ellis When he was allowed to go outside, Saddam Hussein saved bread scraps from his meals to feed to the birds, Sgt Ellis said. "He said he was a farmer when he was young and he never forgot where he came from," Sgt Ellis said. Saddam talked about when he used to read bedtime stories to his young children and recalled giving his daughter medicine for an upset stomach.

Bush plans to roll out new Iraq strategy this week
By Justin Webb BBC News, Washington  Mr Bush has come under pressure to change his strategy on Iraq The speech will reveal a plan to send more US troops to Iraq to focus on ways of bringing greater security, rather than training Iraqi forces. The move comes with figures from Iraqi ministries suggesting that deaths among civilians are at record highs. The US president arrived back in Washington on Monday after a week-long holiday at his ranch in Texas. The BBC was told by a senior administration source that the speech setting out changes in Mr Bush's Iraq policy is likely to come in the middle of next week. The speech, the BBC has been told, involves increasing troop numbers. The exact mission of the extra troops in Iraq is still under discussion, according to officials, but it is likely to focus on providing security rather than training Iraqi forces. As they prepare to take control of Congress this week and face up to campaign pledges to restore bipartisanship and openness, Democrats are planning to largely sideline Republicans from the first burst of lawmaking. But instead of allowing Republicans to fully participate in deliberations, as promised after the Democratic victory in the Nov. 7 midterm elections, Democrats now say they will use House rules to prevent the opposition from offering alternative measures, assuring speedy passage of the bills and allowing their party to trumpet early victories. Nancy Pelosi, the Californian who will become House speaker, and Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, who will become majority leader, finalized the strategy over the holiday recess in a flurry of conference calls and meetings with other party leaders.

US raids Iran 'liaison office', Russia says it is unacceptable
TEHRAN, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. forces raided the Iranian consulate in Iraq's northern city of Arbil and arrested five of its staff members, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported on Thursday. After disarming the consulate's guards and breaking into the gate, U.S. troops ent ered the office building early Thursday morning, IRNA said, confirming Iraqi state television's earlier reports. The Iraqi state television reported earlier that Multi-National Forces in Arbil detained staff members of the Iranian consulate there and confiscated computers and some documents. The U.S. troops arrested five staff members and confiscated computers and documents, IRNA quoted "reliable sources" as saying. The Iranian Embassy in Baghdad sent a letter to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry Thursday morning to protest against "the U.S. illegal move" and call on the Iraqi government to help secure immediate release of the five people, IRNA said. According to Iran's state television, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said that U.S. forces in Iraq "bear full responsibility for the fate of the abducted diplomats." Top envoys of the Iraqi Embassy as well as the Swiss Embassy, which takes care of the U.S. interests in Iran, were summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry for explanations, the television said. Quoting its reporter in Arbil, the television said that forces under the control of Iraq's Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani had tried to prevent U.S. troops from taking away the diplomats, deeming the U.S. move as an affront to the authority of the self-rule regional government. Under an agreement between Baghdad and Tehran, Iran set up its consulate in the city in 2006 to facilitate cross-border visits of their citizens.

Israeli head of military Dan Halutz resigns
By Jo Floto BBC News, Jerusalem  The resignation may not draw a line under discussion of recent military failures Last August, just 10 days after the conflict had ended, Lt Gen Dan Halutz was already admitting that mistakes had been made. There had been failures in combat, he said, "notably in the areas of logistics, operations and command". There had been successes too, he added, but many in Israel were left wondering what had actually gone right. After more than a month of fighting, Hezbollah was still able to fire rockets into the north of the country, and the two soldiers whose capture had sparked the conflict were still in captivity. Gen Halutz, a former Air force chief, was accused of relying too heavily on aerial bombardment, and of botching the ground offensive. Poor preparations Soldiers, and particularly reservists, had complained of poor leadership, lack of equipment, poor training and a shortage of supplies. Some told of spending days without food, forced to drink water from the canteens of dead Lebanese guerrillas. In order to guide and lead we must live up to our responsibilities Dan Halutz's resignation letter Critics wondered why the army appeared not to have been prepared for a war on the northern border. No 'running away' Earlier this month he told a news conference that would he stay on ''to correct what can be corrected',' dismissing calls for his resignation saying it would be "running away".

Sinn Fein votes to accept policing
About 900 party members voted on the motion at a special party conference (ard fheis) in Dublin which was attended by more than 2,000 people. Sinn Fein support for policing and DUP commitment to power-sharing are seen as essential to restoring NI devolution. A six hour debate was cut short as the leadership forced a vote which was carried with 90% support. The decision gives Sinn Fein's ruling executive the authority to declare its support for the PSNI and the criminal justice system when devolution is restored and policing and justice powers are transferred to the Northern Ireland Assembly. You have created the potential to change the political landscape on this island forever Gerry Adams Reaction to the Sinn Fein vote Q&A: The vote Speaking after the vote, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said the decision was truly historic. "Today you have created the potential to change the political landscape on this island forever," he said. "You have created the opportunity to significantly advance our struggle and you have seized the opportunity to further our primary objective of united Ireland through the building of greater political strength." Mr Adams also said that republicanism and unionism had reached an historic compromise. "If the promise and hope of the peace process is to deliver peace and prosperity, that means beginning a real dialogue, an anti-sectarian dialogue, a dialogue which will move us to a real future," he added. A spokesman for Tony Blair said the prime minister welcomed the "historic decision and recognised the leadership it has taken to get to this point". He said: "It is vital that we continue to maintain the momentum from the St Andrews agreement and the timetable set out in that agreement." "What had always been a massive impediment to stable and lasting government (in Northern Ireland) has been removed," he said.

Recovery plan for New Orleans to be ratified
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 11 -- Angry homeowners screamed and City Council members seethed Wednesday as this city's recovery commission recommended imposing a four-month building moratorium on most of New Orleans and creating a powerful new authority that could use eminent domain to seize homes in neighborhoods that will not be rebuilt. Hundreds of residents packed into a hotel ballroom interrupted the presentation of the long-awaited proposal with shouts and taunts, booed its main architect and unrolled a litany of complaints. One by one, homeowners stepped to a microphone to lampoon the plan -- which contemplates a much smaller city and relies on persuading the federal government to spend billions on new housing and a light-rail system -- as "audacious," "an academic exercise," "garbage," "a no-good, rotten scheme." "You missed the boat," homeowner Fred Yoder, who lived in heavily flooded Lakeview, told committee members. "Give me a break: We don't need a light-rail system. The plan released Wednesday is the first stage of what is sure to be a multi-layered, multi-level effort to resuscitate New Orleans. Mayor C. Ray Nagin, who can accept or alter the proposal, will have to present the plan to a state commission that will control allocation of billions of federal dollars, as well as to Donald E. Powell, President Bush's hurricane recovery coordinator, and the White House. The commission's recommendations are heavily dependent on federal money, counting on $12 billion to buy storm-damaged homes and $4.8 billion for infrastructure improvements, including an ambitious light-rail proposal to connect downtown New Orleans with the city's airport, Baton Rouge and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The furious reaction to the plan is the latest agonizing episode in this city's troubled campaign to reinvigorate itself after the devastating floods caused by Hurricane Katrina last August. Nagin, already politically weakened by widespread criticism of his response to the flooding, now faces the difficult challenge of guiding decisions about whether some parts of the city will cease to exist. Some activists have long accused the commission -- which was appointed by Nagin -- of trying to find ways to abandon predominantly black neighborhoods, such as the Lower Ninth Ward. Wednesday's unveiling did nothing to assuage their fears, even though commission members promised to give all neighborhoods an opportunity to prove that they should be rebuilt by convening planning groups in coming months. The proposed moratorium would be in the city's most damaged neighborhoods, and officials would use the four-month period to gauge whether enough residents will come back to make the areas viable. "If this plan goes forward as it is, many people's worst fears about our African American heritage and population will come true," said Sue Sperry of the New Orleans Preservation Resource Center.

US claims Iraqi militants armed with Iranian weapons
There should be no foreign troops in Iraq, the president said Interview clip Mr Ahmadinejad made the comments in a rare US television interview on Monday. He was speaking after US officials said they had evidence Iran was providing weapons to Shia militias in Iraq who were attacking the US military. Mr Ahmadinejad said Iran "shied away from all conflict" and that no peace would come with foreign troops in Iraq. 'Baseless propaganda' In the interview with ABC Television in Tehran, Mr Ahmadinejad was asked if he feared a US military attack. Why should we be afraid?" Mr Ahmadinejad said he thought the possibility of such an attack was "very low". The US is following another policy, trying to hide its defeats and failures and that's why it is pointing its fingers to others Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Ahmadinejad excerpts "We think there are wise people in the US who would stop such illegal actions," he said. And he stressed that Iran's position was clear, saying, "Anyone who wants to attack our country will be severely punished." The Bush administration denies it is planning to invade Iran but has indicated it is willing to use military force to deal with any Iranian interference inside Iraq. He said the accusations were "excuses to prolong the stay" of US forces and that they would need a "court to prove the case". "The US is following another policy, trying to hide its defeats and failures and that's why it is pointing its fingers to others," Mr Ahmadinejad said.

Uefa rejected their initial protest and a subsequent appeal so the French club considered taking their protest to the Court of Arbitration of Sport. But on Friday Lille, who also lost the second leg 1-0, announced they would not be taking their appeal any further. A statement on the club's official website said: "In order not to sink into relentless legal proceedings with no end in sight, (we) have taken the decision not to pursue its appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport." Lille were eliminated from the Champions League on Wednesday, with United completing a 2-0 aggregate victory. Uefa also charged Lille with the improper behaviour of their players, who appeared to contemplate leaving the pitch in protest at United's goal. Barca poured men forward but the Reds took the lead when Bellamy teed up Riise to fire home and they held on to win despite seeing Deco hit the post. The pre-match headlines had been all about an alleged training camp fracas between Bellamy and Riise - but both were in Liverpool's starting line-up and instantly linked up as the Reds made a confident start to the game. Inside the first four minutes Steven Gerrard released Riise and his driven cross from the left was only just too strong for the Welshman.

Iranian TV station announces first space rocket launch
But officials later said it was for research and would not go into orbit. Experts say if Iran has fired a rocket into space it would cause alarm abroad as it would mean scientists had crossed important technological barriers. Iran has made little secret of its desire to become a space power and already has a satellite in orbit launched by the Russians. The latest launch - if confirmed - comes at a time of mounting tension between Tehran and the West over Iran's controversial nuclear programme. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany are due to meet on Monday to discuss the possibility of more sanctions over the nuclear issue. Iran's potential nuclear military programme, combined with an advanced missile capability, would destabilise the region Sir Richard Dalton, former UK ambassador to Iran One of his deputy foreign ministers, Manouchehr Mohammadi, said they had prepared themselves for any situation arising from the issue, even for war. Meanwhile, foreign ministers from seven Muslim states meeting in Pakistan have called for a diplomatic solution to the "dangerous" stand-off. "It is vital that all issues must be resolved through diplomacy and there must be no resort to use of force," said a statement issued after talks involving ministers from Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Missile technology Iranian TV broke the news of the reported test saying: "The first space rocket has been successfully launched into space." Ahmadinejad has claimed Iran's right to nuclear technology It quoted the head of Iran's aerospace research centre, Mohsen Bahrami, as saying that "the rocket was carrying material intended for research created by the ministries of science and defence". However, Ali Akbar Golrou, executive director of the same facility, was later quoted by Fars news agency as saying the craft launched by was a sub-orbital rocket for scientific research. It would not remain in orbit but could rise to about 150km (94 miles) before a parachute-assisted descent to Earth.

Toxic chemical spills in the Ohio River
The lower Ohio River has reopened to barge traffic after being shut for more than 12 hours due to a tow boat hitting a lock and a barge leaking a petrochemical into the waterway, the U.S. Coast Guard said on Thursday. REUTERS/Graphic CHICAGO The lower Ohio River has reopened to barge traffic after being shut for more than 12 hours due to a tow boat hitting a lock and a barge leaking a petrochemical into the waterway, the U.S. Coast Guard said on Thursday. The stretch of the river near Brookport, Illinois, reopened around 10:30 p.m. CST Wednesday (0430 GMT Thursday), said Lt. Wayne Chapman at the Marine Safety Unit in Paducah, Kentucky. The closure was from mile marker 938 to 940. The barge was carrying 960,000 gallons of cumene or isopropylbenzene, a colorless liquid used in paint thinners, motor fuels and rubber. The closure did not greatly affect the flow of grain or petroleum on the waterway, traders said. The damaged barge remains on the river, with traffic limited to one direction for a mile in either direction of the vessel. About 10,300 gallons of cumene leaked into the river, but further contamination was not expected, Chapman said. Story Highlights • A barge hit an underwater dam, Coast Guard said • There's no threat to public drinking water, officials said • Cumene, a solvent used to produce other chemicals, was spilled • Experts determining the environmental impact of the spill Adjust font size: BROOKPORT, Illinois (CNN) -- As many as 8,000 gallons of a toxic solvent spilled into the Ohio River Wednesday after a barge hit an underwater dam, Coast Guard and Illinois state officials told CNN. Lt. Wayne Chapman of the U.S. Coast Guard said the barge, owned by Kirby Marine, hit the wicket dam, which is a type of movable dam, near Brookport and began leaking cumene, a solvent used to produce other chemicals. So far, officials said, there's no threat to public drinking water. Maggie Carson of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield that experts are trying to determine the environmental impact of the spill. "There's a tremendous volume of water going through there, so there's a dilution factor, and this will be taken into consideration as they try to take measures to contain it," she said.

DUP and Sinn Féin make gains in Northern Ireland Assembly election
Brian Wilson said he was thrilled to be elected The party's NI chairperson Brian Wilson was elected in the North Down constituency on the 10th count after polling 2,839 first preference votes. Mr Wilson has been a councillor on North Down Borough Council since 1981, representing Alliance, then as an independent, before joining the Greens. He said he was thrilled "to have the opportunity of pushing forward Green Party policy in the assembly". "We are one of the youngest political parties in Northern Ireland but these elections have shown the level of support out there for our policies, and how quickly this support is growing. "It is tremendously rewarding that the Greens will now be a permanent fixture in the political landscape of Northern Ireland," he said. Irish Green Party leader Trevor Sargent, a member of the Irish parliament, said Mr Wilson's election was a breakthrough for the party in the whole of Ireland. "Brian's election, which resulted from extensive cross-community support, means that there is now Green representation at every level of political power on this island," Mr Sargent said. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern speaking in Brussels Mr Hain said it was up to the parties to decide if they would sign up to power-sharing by the 26 March deadline. The talks come as the British and Irish prime ministers urged political leaders not to miss an opportunity of "historic proportions" to restore power-sharing.

Methane gas explosion at Ulyanovskaya Mine kills at least 108
Mines in Siberia's Kuzbass coal area have suffered from underfunding Attempts to rescue three Russian coal miners trapped underground are continuing, after an explosion killed 107 people at a Siberian pit on Monday. One more body was recovered late on Tuesday at the Ulyanovskaya mine, and officials said the search for the three still missing was proving difficult. Some 93 people were rescued from the mine, devastated by a methane blast. Virtually the whole of the mine's management died in the explosion. Rescuers described a scene of utter devastation, with collapsed and flooded mineshafts and bodies ripped apart. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Moscow says it is Russia's worst mining disaster for a generation. It occurred at 1030 (0730 GMT) on Monday, at a depth of about 270m (885 feet). However, the mine in question was only built a few years ago and had just had a new safety system installed. The mine is run by Yuzhkuzbassugol, an affiliate of Russian coal and steel firm Evraz Group SA.

Contaminated pet food causes massive recall
WASHINGTON – As many as one in six animals died in tests of suspect dog and cat food by the Canadian manufacturer after complaints were received that the products were poisoning pets around the United States, the U.S. government said today. A federal investigation is focusing on wheat gluten as the likely source of contamination that sparked a recall last Friday of 60 million cans and pouches of the suspect food, said Stephen F. Sundlof, the Food and Drug Administration's top veterinarian. The ingredient, a protein source, is commonly used as filler. Agency investigators are looking at other ingredients as well. Menu Foods told the FDA it received the first complaints of kidney failure and deaths among cats and dogs from pet owners on Feb. 20. During those tests, the company fed its product to 40 to 50 dogs and cats and some seven animals – the mix of species was not immediately known – died, Sundlof said. The contamination appeared more deadly to cats than to dogs, he said. The food was sold under both store and major brand labels at Wal-Mart, Kroger, Safeway and other large retailers. The FDA has yet to tally how many reports it has received of cats and dogs suffering kidney failure or death. We're talking about 1 per cent of the pet food (supply) and it's really just impossible to extrapolate at this point," Sundlof said.

Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said the release had not been "simple" and that more details would be released later. Italian officials say the journalist will arrive in the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Tuesday and then fly home to Italy. Shortly afterwards, a tape was released in which the journalist said he had just two days to live.

15 Royal Navy sailors captured at gunpoint by Iranian guards
The men were seized at 1030 local time when they boarded a boat in the Gulf, off the coast of Iraq, which they suspected was smuggling cars. The Royal Navy said the group was on a routine patrol in Iraqi waters and were understood to be unharmed. The Associated Press news agency is quoting US Navy official, Commander Kevin Aandahl, as saying that Iran's Revolutionary Guard were responsible. Mr Aandahl is also reported as saying the naval force had told them in a radio message that the British were not harmed. She added that she had called for a "full explanation" from Iran and had left them in no doubt that she wanted the group and their equipment back immediately. The task force's commander, Commodore Nick Lambert, said he was hoping there had been a "simple mistake" over territorial waters. He said that despite scant communication, the 15 people were understood to be safe and had reacted in an "extremely professional way, in line with the rules of engagement".

Iran 'suspends' releasing British soldiers; Shots fired near Iranian Consul in Basra, Iraq
The captured sailors have been shown on Iranian television Iranian TV footage Ali Larijani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, appeared to be referring to the UK's refusal to agree the crew had been in Iranian waters. Iran's insistence the group was in its waters last Friday saw the UK release GPS evidence to back up its denials. Tony Blair's official spokesman said the UK was not seeking a confrontation. Mr Larijani, head of Iran's supreme national security council, said: "It was announced that a woman in the group would be freed, but (this development) was met with an incorrect attitude." He later added on Iranian state radio the UK had "miscalculated" in its handling of the case. "They have created a ballyhoo over diplomatic ties and raised the issue with the UN," he said. "This will not help solve the issue. The British leaders are miscalculating the case." UN backing sought BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said Mr Larijani appeared to be responding to the failure to secure an admission from the UK. Prime minister's spokesman Scots marine among captives The Foreign Office said the UN was preparing to issue a statement calling for the release of the crew.

Adult-only TLD rejected by Internet body
The Icann board rejected the proposal nine votes to five The proposal for the .xxx domain was voted out by the overseer of the net's addressing system, seven years after the ideas was first put forward. Board members said they were concerned that approval would put the agency into the position of a content regulator. Backers of the .xxx domain said they were disappointed by the decision and would pursue the matter further. It is the third time that the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) has rejected the bid. Law-makers The idea of creating a net domain for pornography was first floated in 2001 and was given approval in June 2005 by Icann which oversees the net's addressing system. Final approval was scheduled to take place in December 2005 but this was delayed until May 2006 when the proposal was abruptly dropped over worries about how sites signing up to use .xxx would be policed. We are extremely disappointed by the board's action today Stuart Lawley, ICM Registry At the time, ICM Registry - the backer of the .xxx scheme - gave pledges that it would ensure sites signing up did not hit users with spam or spyware. ICM also had to give assurances that it would put in place systems to prevent children seeing the sites and that no .xxx sites would contain images of child abuse. A final decision on the domain name was taken at a meeting of board members in Lisbon, Portugal. "This decision was the result of very careful scrutiny and consideration of all the arguments," said Dr Vinton Cerf, chairman of Icann. "That consideration had led a majority of the board to believe that the proposal should be rejected." Many on the board voted against the proposals because they felt that accepting the domain would mean Icann would be seen as a regulator of content, deciding what is pornographic and what is not.

Ahmadinejad to free British navy personnel
"On the occasion of the birth anniversary of the great prophet of Islam, and on the occasion of Easter and Passover, I would like to announce that the great nation of Iran, while it is entitled to put the British military personnel on trial, has pardoned these 15 sailors and gives their release to the people of Britain as a gift. "I would like Mr Blair's government not to punish the sailors for acknowledging and telling the truth. They can go to the airport and they can go to their families. "I ask Mr Blair instead of occupying the other countries, I ask Mr Blair to think about the justice - to think about the truth and work for the British people not for himself." He said the British people should be told the truth about what the "British soldiers" were doing in Iranian waters. I'm sure the British people have every right to ask their government... what their soldiers were doing in Iraq or in Iranian water. Mr Ahmadinejad said the people of Iran were very upset at what he called the "invasion by the British sailors". "At this moment I wanted to say on behalf of the Iranian people - I wanted to thank the people who... arrested [them], I'm... admiring the commander who managed to capture these people who came to our water. I wanted to thank him for his braveness and I give him the third kind of medal."

British navy personnel back home
Leading Seaman Chris Coe was shown on Iranian television The crew, freed by Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a "gift" to the British people on Wednesday, touched down at Heathrow Airport at 1200 BST. They were then flown to a Royal Marines base in Devon to see friends and relatives, and to be de-briefed. Tony Blair welcomed their return but accused elements of the Iranian regime of supporting terrorism in Iraq. 'Dual strategy' In a press conference given outside Downing Street, the prime minister said he was "glad" the crew had been returned "safe and unharmed". He said "no deal" had been done with the Iranians to secure the crew's release. He contrasted the rejoicing at the return of the crew with the "sober and ugly reality" of the deaths of four British soldiers in Iraq in what he described as a "terrorist act". However, he said it was "too early to say" whether the UK troops had been killed by Iranian-backed insurgents. The prime minister said the government had pursued a "dual-track strategy" of remaining open to dialogue with Iran, while "mobilising international support and pressure". "In my view it would be utterly naive to believe that our personnel would have been released unless both elements of the strategy had been present." Defence Secretary Des Browne said the navy crew, most of whom are in their 20s, had "acted with immense courage and dignity". De-briefing The navy personnel arrived at Tehran Airport early on Thursday in a fleet of official cars after 13 days in Iranian custody.

33 dead, 15 injured in Virginia Tech shootings
Story Highlights • Witness describes gunman coming back to classroom • University officials say 33 dead, including a gunman • Attacks mark deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history  Adjust font size: BLACKSBURG, Virginia (CNN) -- A gunman who killed at least 30 people in one of two shootings on the campus of Virginia Tech was dressed "almost like a Boy Scout," said a student who survived by pretending to lie dead on a classroom floor. "He just stepped within five feet of the door and just started firing," said Erin Sheehan, who was in one of the Norris Hall classrooms where the second shooting incident took place. Sheehan described the gunman -- who later shot and killed himself, according to police -- as a young man wearing a short-sleeved tan shirt and black ammunition vest. "He seemed very thorough about it -- getting almost everyone down -- I pretended to be dead," she said. (Watch student describe surviving by playing dead ) "He was very silent," said Sheehan, one of only four students in her 25-student German class who were not shot. "We forced ourselves against the door so he couldn't come in again, because the door would not lock." The man tried three more times to force his way in and then began firing through the door, she said. She and about 20 other people took refuge behind a locked door in a teacher's office. (Watch a student's recording of police responding to loud bangs ) "They were telling us to put our hands above our head and if we didn't cooperate and put our hands above our heads they would shoot," Otey said.

Virginia Tech shooter identified, witness reports emerge
Yesterday’s mass shooting at Virginia Tech — the worst in American history — is another horrifying reminder that some of the gravest dangers Americans face come from killers at home armed with guns that are frighteningly easy to obtain. Not much is known about the gunman, who is reported to have killed himself, or about his motives or how he got his weapons, so it is premature to draw too many lessons from this tragedy. But it seems a safe bet that in one way or another, this will turn out to be another instance in which an unstable or criminally minded individual had no trouble arming himself and harming defenseless people. In the wake of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre — in which two alienated students plotted for months before killing 12 students, a teacher and themselves — public school administrators focused heavily on spotting warning signs early enough to head off tragedy. As the investigation of the Virginia Tech shootings unfolds in coming days, it will be important to ascertain whether there were any hints of the tragedy to come and what might be done to head off such horrors in the future. Campuses are inherently open communities, and Virginia Tech has some 26,000 students using hundreds of buildings over 2,600 acres. It is not easy to guarantee a safe haven. The initial shootings killed two students in a dormitory around 7:15 a.m., prompting a 911 call and a police response. Two hours later a second, more lethal round of shooting claimed some 30 lives in an engineering building across campus.

Nearly a dozen killed in suicide bomber attack in Iraq
Taking into account the untapped potential of Iraq's western desert, the war-torn country's oil reserves could be nearly twice as large   A Sunni insurgent coalition announced an "Islamic Cabinet" for Iraq and named the head of al Qaeda in Iraq as "minister of war" in a Web video Thursday aimed at showing their strength in leading the fight against the Iraqi government. Al Qaeda-led Iraqi insurgents issued a video Thursday purporting to show the killing of 20 kidnapped Iraqi police and soldiers, each shot in the head execution-style as they knelt in a row. The Islamic State of Iraq, a coalition of Sunni insurgents including al Qaeda in Iraq, claimed on Saturday to have abducted the 20 and threatened to kill them after 48 hours unless the government freed female prisoners and handed over police accused of a rape. President Bush sparred across the table with Democratic congressional leaders opposed to the Iraq war in a prelude to a veto showdown over a conflict that has claimed the lives of more than 3,200 U.S. troops and tens of thousands of Iraqis. During an hour-long meeting at the White House on Wednesday, the president told lawmakers directly that he will not sign any bill that includes a timetable for withdrawing American forces, and they made it clear Congress will send him one anyway. Iraq's hotly debated draft oil law is to be sent to parliament next week, the country's oil minister said on Wednesday, and CBS News reporter Larry Miller says Iraqis could be sitting on nearly twice as much oil as previously thought, according to a comprehensive new geological study (read more)   A policeman and a civilian woman were killed when gunmen opened fire on a police patrol in Baqouba, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad, police said. An Iraqi soldier was gunned down near Kut, 100 miles southeast of Baghdad, according to officials at a nearby hospital where his body was brought. In the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, 180 miles north of Baghdad, seven employees of the North Oil Company, a state-run enterprise, were seriously wounded in another drive-by shooting, police said. "The clock is ticking," Gates told reporters, saying he will warn Iraqi officials that they must move faster on political reconciliation. Democrats have seized on those remarks to bolster their arguments that there must be a deadline for the Pentagon to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq.The last time a U.S. defense secretary visited Fallujah — which until late 2004 was a key stronghold of the Sunni insurgency — it was Donald H. Rumsfeld, who stopped here in December 2005 to announce a plan to begin reducing U.S. troops.

"The game isn't so much shooting itself in the foot, as blowing off both feet."

High turnout observed in French presidential election
PARIS, April 22 -- French voters Sunday chose ruling party candidate Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist Ségolène Royal to compete in the French presidential runoff in two weeks, with a massive voter turnout backing a generational shift of the country's leadership. Sarkozy, the tough-talking former interior minister and candidate of the Union for a Popular Movement party, won 31 percent of the vote, and Royal, who has cast herself as a maternal protector vying to be France's first female president, received 26 percent, with nearly all of the ballots counted. Eighty-four percent of the 44.5 million eligible voters cast ballots -- an apparent record in a first-round presidential ballot in France -- reflecting the urgency of an election that centered on the country's fear of economic decline at home and diminishing influence abroad. The election results indicate that French voters want a clear choice in the decisive May 6 runoff, which will be a classic right-left showdown pitting the hard-line, pro-business, pro-American Sarkozy, 52, against Royal, 53, who advocates greater spending for social welfare programs and supports more multipolar global relations. Royal, a mother of four, is the first woman to advance to the second round in a French presidential race. "I want to tell all the French who are scared, who are scared of the future, who feel fragile, vulnerable, who find life harder and harder, I want to tell them that I want to protect them," Sarkozy said in a victory speech to supporters at a concert hall near the Champs Elysees. The comments clearly were aimed at voters who tell pollsters they find Sarkozy, the son of a Hungarian immigrant, too tough and divisive. Royal, speaking to boisterous supporters in her voting district town of Melle in southwestern France, said she wanted to lead "the fight for change, so that France can stand up again, to get optimism back." In a clear swipe at Sarkozy -- though she didn't name him -- Royal said she wanted to "change France without brutalizing it." The campaign was dominated by voter calls for change as the domestic economy and job market have stagnated and France's international financial and diplomatic influence is waning. Both Sarkozy and Royal pledged major changes to shake France from its doldrums, and both promise a less imperial presidency that is more in touch with the people.

REUTERS/Fatih Saribas (TURKEY) ANKARA Turkey's Islamist-rooted government said on Tuesday it would put its presidential candidate to a new vote in parliament on Wednesday, after the Constitutional Court annulled a ballot held last week. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan left the door open to possible early national elections to resolve the standoff between his government and Turkey's secularists, including the army which has threatened to intervene. Turkish financial markets recorded their biggest falls in a year on Monday and the currency lost more ground on Tuesday as the standoff rocked the predominantly Muslim European Union candidate nation. The Constitutional Court ruled not enough parliamentarians were present when the first round was held in the assembly last week. "What we have cancelled is the first round of voting," Hasim Kilic, deputy head of the court, told reporters. Government spokesman Cemil Cicek said shortly afterwards the cabinet would seek the required attendance of 367 parliamentarians for Wednesday's vote in which Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, a former Islamist, would be the sole candidate. Cicek told a news conference the government was ready to hold early national polls as sought by opposition parties and the business elite, provided parliament agreed to legislation lowering the age threshold for parliamentarians to 25 from 30. The army, which sees itself as the final guarantor of the secular state, has ousted four governments in the last 50 years, most recently in 1997 when it acted against a cabinet in which Gul served.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/Files BELFAST The Ulster Volunteer Force, the most lethal of Northern Ireland's Protestant paramilitary groups, said on Thursday it would put "beyond reach" weapons it used against Catholics opposed to British rule in the province. "As of midnight, Thursday 3rd May 2007, the Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando will assume a non military, civilianised, role," the UVF said in a statement. The UVF also said it had ended recruitment and military training and instructed members to obey the rule of law. The group, which killed more people than any other Protestant gang during 30 years of sectarian conflict in the province, said its move followed disarmament by the opposing and predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army. "We need to see how today's announcement is translated into action," a spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said. Irish premier Bertie Ahern said the move was "potentially very important" but joined others in pointing out that putting weapons beyond reach was not the same as disarming. When the IRA ended its armed campaign against British rule and so-called 'loyalist' groups such as the UVF, it refused to dispose of its weapons in public but did agree to the presence of independent monitors to verify the scale of decommissioning. The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), headed by retired Canadian General John de Chastelain, said it was ready to work with the UVF. "While we're encouraged by their proposal to end their involvement in paramilitarism, and to reject criminal activity, we are concerned by their intention to deal with their arms without the involvement of the IICD," the commission said. London and Dublin called on the UVF and other loyalist groups to stand down last month after a ceasefire watchdog found that while they had not recently been engaged in "terrorism", some members were involved in violence and crime.

Kenya Airways jet with at least 114 on board crashes
Worried friends and relatives gathered at Kenya's main airport Rescuers in southern Cameroon have resumed searching for a Kenya Airways airliner thought to have crashed on Saturday with 114 people aboard. The flight, which originated in Ivory Coast, is believed to have come down in dense jungle after taking off in heavy rain from Douala en route to Nairobi. Searchers using helicopters are focusing on the Lolodorf area after reports of an explosion there. The missing come from more than 20 countries, including five Britons. The Boeing 737-800 was just six months old and part of a new fleet bought by the airline. The presumed crash will raise questions about whether other aircraft will be taken out of service, the BBC's Karen Allen reports from Nairobi. Kenya's national carrier has a good safety record but 169 people died when one of its planes crashed in 2000. The last communication with the missing plane was received by the control tower in Douala, on the coast, shortly after take-off, Kenya Airways said. A distress signal was later sent out by the plane, Kenyan Airways chief executive Titus Naikuni said, adding that this would have been sent out automatically. A BBC correspondent in Lolodorf says the situation there has been chaotic, and heavy rains on Saturday prevented a ground search from taking place. 'Anxious and desperate' Kenyan Transport Minister Chirau Ali Makwere - who is leading a team of Kenya Airways and government officials to Douala - said it was too early to determine what had happened to the plane.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier PARIS French president-elect Nicolas Sarkozy disappeared on a retreat with his family on Monday to consider his government line-up and plot strategy for a crucial parliamentary election in June. Sarkozy, a combative conservative, won a strong mandate for political and economic change by winning 53.06 percent of the vote in Sunday's presidential run-off against 46.94 for Socialist Segolene Royal. But he needs to secure a majority in the election for the National Assembly on June 10 and 17 to make good on his vows to loosen rigid labor laws, trim fat from the public service, cut taxes and restore full employment. "We are going to see how we can give him the biggest parliamentary majority possible so he can put into effect his undertakings," Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie told reporters outside Sarkozy's campaign headquarters. Sarkozy left Paris in the morning with his wife and son, after spending the night in a luxury hotel. They arrived unannounced on a private aircraft on the Mediterranean island of Malta, airport sources told Reuters on Monday. "These few days rest were planned to put him more in the mindset of a president after the tumultuous battle," said Claude Gueant, his campaign director. "It will also be a few days to let him reflect on the make-up of his government team," he told RTL radio. On Monday night, between 300 and 400 youths who were chanting anti-Sarkozy slogans smashed shop windows and burnt at least 2 scooters at the historic Place de la Bastille in central Paris.

Northern Ireland has home rule returned
Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern saw devolution return Enlarge Image  DUP leader Ian Paisley and Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness took office as first and deputy first ministers as five years of direct rule ended. Mr Blair said that the day's events offered the chance for Northern Ireland to "escape the heavy chains of history" and "make history anew". In October 2002, allegations of intelligence gathering within Stormont led to the suspension of power-sharing institutions. "Look back and we see centuries pock-marked by conflict, hardship, even hatred, among the people of these islands," the prime minister said. Irish Premier Bertie Ahern thanked all the politicians who have been involved in the peace process, but reserved special praise for Mr Blair. Mr Paisley said: "Today we are starting upon the road which I believe will take us to lasting peace in our province." He added: "I welcome the pledge we have all taken to that effect today... that is the rock foundation upon which we must build." Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said he wished Ian Paisley all the best as they began "the greatest, yet most exciting, challenge of our lives". "We must overcome the difficulties which we face in order to achieve our goals and seize the opportunities that now exist," he said. SDLP leader Mark Durkan said: "What today shows is that when finally you have a government setting a deadline and setting terms and keeping to them, you can get somewhere."

Reports: Taliban leader Mullah Dadullah killed in Afghanistan
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, May 13 -- Mullah Dadullah was the face of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan as it used suicide bombings, videotaped beheadings and targeted assassinations to escalate its insurgent campaign over the past two years. Dadullah periodically turned up on television to taunt the Afghan government and U.S.-led international forces with threats of ever more ambitious attacks. On Sunday, his face was on display again, resting on a pink sheet, bloody and lifeless. A bullet hole was visible in the back of his head, with two more piercings in his stomach. Dadullah, the Taliban's top operational commander, was killed Saturday after U.S.-led troops and Afghan forces tracked him down and surrounded him in southern Afghanistan, according to Afghan and international security officials. His death was hailed by those officials as a critical victory in the fight against the Taliban at a time when the extremist Islamic movement has destabilized large portions of the country through Dadullah's uncompromising approach to warfare. "We fully expect Mullah Dadullah will be replaced in time, but for now the insurgency has received a serious blow," said Maj. John Thomas, a spokesman for the NATO-led force that patrols Afghanistan and that supported U.S.-led operations against Dadullah. Thomas described Dadullah as "the top person in our scope in Afghanistan that we were interested in removing." Although the group's overall leader, Mohammad Omar, remains at large, he is believed to play a lesser role in the organization's military operations. A Taliban spokesman denied that Dadullah had been killed, but witnesses who inspected the body as it lay at the governor's palace in the southern city of Kandahar on Sunday identified it as Dadullah's, based on distinctive facial features and a missing left leg. Dadullah boasted in an interview this year that he had deployed 6,000 fighters for a spring offensive and that suicide bombers had infiltrated every major Afghan city. Those claims, however, were widely believed to have been exaggerated, and the offensive has largely failed to materialize.

Five members of US patrol killed; Three missing in Iraq
(AP) In Other Developments: The United States and Iran said Sunday they will hold upcoming talks in Baghdad about improving Iraq's security — a historic political turnabout that comes amid a last-ditch U.S. military and diplomatic push to stabilize the country. Iraqi lawmakers say Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki plans to give Sunnis more say in security operations in their areas. The deal would stave off a threatened Sunni walkout that could have toppled the al-Maliki's embattled government. Lawmakers describe the agreement as an understanding and not a formal pact; similar arrangements have broken down in the past.

He is expected to play a leading role in the president's plans to reform France's employment and welfare laws. Mr Sarkozy, who succeeded Jacques Chirac on Wednesday, is due to name the rest of his government on Friday. He has promised to halve the number of government ministers to 15, and has said about half will be women. The outgoing prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, who resigned from the post on Tuesday, received his successor and formally handed over power in a ceremony on Thursday morning.

During the ceremony the new prime minister said: "I will listen to everyone because a France in motion needs everyone." Afterwards Mr de Villepin emerged from the Matignon, wished Mr Fillon good luck and said: "He has all the necessary qualities to succeed in the service of our country." Mr Fillon served as social affairs minister between 2002 to 2004, pushing through a major overhaul of the country's pension system in the midst of large street protests. He has also served in several other government posts for the UMP party, but lost his place in Mr Chirac's administration in 2005 and pledged his loyalty to Mr Sarkozy. Getting France moving again - Mr Sarkozy sets the pace "There is a demand for change. Never have the risks of inertia been so great for France as they are now in this world in flux where everyone across the world is trying to change quicker than the others, where any delay can be fatal," he said.

Wolfowitz to quit as head of the World Bank
Paul Wolfowitz says he has been the victim of a smear campaign After lengthy talks with the bank's board, Mr Wolfowitz said he would quit the global lending body on 30 June. He had faced widespread calls for his resignation after being accused of a conflict of interest over a pay rise given to ex-bank employee Shaha Riza. The White House, which had backed Mr Wolfowitz, said President George W Bush reluctantly accepted his decision. The bank said it would start an immediate search for his successor. 'Good faith' In a statement, the board of directors said it accepted Mr Wolfowitz's assurances that he had "acted ethically and in good faith" in the handling of Ms Riza's role and remuneration. But it acknowledged that a "number of mistakes" had been made. I have concluded it is in the best interests of those whom the institution serves for that mission to be carried forward under new leadership Paul Wolfowitz The Bank after Wolfowitz Reaction to resignation Q&A: Wolfowitz row In response, Mr Wolfowitz said his decision to resign was "in the best interests" of the institution, which has more than 180 member countries worldwide. He has been under severe pressure for weeks, with a number of European politicians calling on him to step down to prevent the Bank's credibility from being eroded. A spokeswoman for the bank's staff association - which had been at the forefront of calls for Mr Wolfowitz's resignation - said: "He has damaged the institution and continues to damage it every day that he remains as its president."

Iran continues enrichment in defiance of UN according to IAEA report
Mr ElBaradei has faced criticism from Europe and the US It followed a UN nuclear watchdog warning that Tehran was stepping up enrichment and obstructing inspections. Mohamed ElBaradei is due to address a joint US-Russian conference on nuclear proliferation later on Thursday. He is set to call on the international community to prevent Iran enriching uranium on an industrial scale. Formal complaint Mr ElBaradei is expected to voice what many analysts fear - that the focus on halting Iran's enrichment experiments has been overtaken by events, says our correspondent in Luxembourg, Jonathan Marcus. The time has come to look at additional pressure... to bring about a change in Iranian calculations US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad UN lists Iran defiance 'Third way' on Iran issue? Mr ElBaradei has suggested that Iran be allowed to keep part of its enrichment programme. This point of view is at odds with that of the US and of a number of key European governments. The US and other European allies were so angered by Mr ElBardei's "unhelpful comments" that they were expected to deliver a formal complaint. Our correspondent says Washington may have some difficulty in persuading all members of the UN Security Council to impose further sanctions. The US described the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s report as "a laundry list of Iran's continued defiance of the international community". Iran has denied hindering the IAEA and said it will "continue to co-operate". In March, the UN Security Council imposed a second round of sanctions on Iran for failing to suspend uranium enrichment, prompting Tehran to limit its co-operation with the agency. However, IAEA inspectors still regularly visit Iran's atomic facilities under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The IAEA said its ability to monitor Iran's activities had "deteriorated" "The time has come to look at additional pressure [...] to bring about a change in Iranian calculations."

Digg  del.icio.us  Newsvine  Reddit  Facebook CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)  Venezuelan police fired tear gas and plastic bullets Monday into a crowd of thousands protesting a decision by President Hugo Chavez that forced a television station critical of his leftist government off the air. Police fired toward the crowd of up to 5,000 protesters from a raised highway, and protesters fled amid clouds of tear gas. It was the largest of several protests that broke out across Caracas hours after Radio Caracas Television ceased broadcasting at midnight Sunday and was replaced with a new state-funded channel. Chavez had refused to renew RCTV's broadcast license, accusing it of "subversive" activities and of backing a 2002 coup against him. Some protesters were seen in television footage hurling spent tear gas canisters back at police. Office workers poured out of buildings to join student protesters, while organizers called for the demonstration to remain peaceful.

New Zealander on oxygen machine dies after power disconnection
The oxygen machine was reliant on the electricity supply Folole Muliaga, a 44-year-old mother of four, died within two hours of the electricity being switched off at her home in the northern city of Auckland. Police said they were investigating the circumstances of Mrs Muliaga's death. The power company, Mercury Energy, said it had been unaware any disconnection would put her life at risk. Relatives of Mrs Muliaga, a schoolteacher, said she had been off work since February with a heart and lung condition. Because of this, the family claim, she had fallen behind with her energy bills. 'Deeply sympathetic' When a company representative arrived at the house to disconnect the supply, they said they impressed upon him her dependency on the machine to stay alive. "He said he is here doing his job and he's here to cut the power off," he was quoted by local media as saying. Paramedics were called but she died within two hours of the power being cut, he added. "We were simply unaware that loss of electricity to the household was putting a vulnerable customer at risk," general manager James Moulder said.

Several people have been arrested in connection with a plot against ground operations at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, CNN said on... REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton NEW YORK Four people, including a former member of Guyana's parliament, have been charged with planning to blow up New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, U.S. officials said on Saturday. This was "one of the most chilling plots imaginable," Roslynn Mauskopf, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said at a news conference in New York. "The devastation that would be caused ... is just unthinkable." The plotters sought to blow up the airport's jet fuel tanks and part of the 40-mile (64-km) pipeline feeding them from New Jersey. Three of the four suspects, who included a former airline cargo handler, have been arrested, federal law enforcement officials said. In a recorded conversation one suspect predicted there would be few survivors and that the attacks would result in the destruction of "the whole of Kennedy." There was no connection to al Qaeda, officials said, but some suspects were linked to an Islamist extremist group in Trinidad. In one recorded conversation, a suspect compared the plot to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, "Even the twin towers can't touch it." Targets in the airport plot included terminal buildings, aircraft and fuel tanks, as well as the fuel pipeline to the airport. The plot was foiled with the help of an informant who recorded conversations with the suspects, some as recent as last month.

Paris Hilton released under house arrest
Paris Hilton was released from prison today after serving just three days of her 45-day sentence, but has been placed under house arrest. The socialite and hotel heiress, jailed for driving offences, was admitted to the Century regional detention facility in Los Angeles just after 11.30pm on Sunday. Hilton had originally been sentenced to 45 days in jail, but this was reduced to 23 for good behaviour. At 2:09am on Thursday morning, Hilton, 26, was "reassigned" to the LA County probation department for medical reasons, and fitted with an electronic tag as part of her punishment. Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the LA County sheriff's department, said the decision to transfer Hilton was taken after "extensive consultation with medical personnel" but would not comment on what those medical issues were. Hilton's lawyer, Richard Hutton, said his client had been doing well after her first night in jail "under the circumstances" on Monday. Hilton has now been fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet and will serve the remainder of her 45-day sentence at her home. She has 40 days left, as the LA authorities have counted Sunday night and Thursday morning towards her sentence. The actor, author, model and star of reality TV show, The Simple Life, pleaded no contest (a guilty plea) in January to charges of alcohol-related reckless driving and was sentenced to three years' probation. Hilton turned herself into the authorities on Sunday night, almost walking off the red carpet at the MTV movie awards in Hollywood and going straight to the detention centre. She is reported to have been paid $500,000 (£251,200) to keep a prison diary, but others fear the short spell will finish her lucrative career.

North Korea fired... REUTERS/Jo Yong-Hak SEOUL North Korea fired up to two short-range missiles off its west coast on Thursday, said U.S. and South Korean officials, prompting quick U.S. criticism of Pyongyang over the second such launch in as many weeks. The launch occurred a day after U.S. President George W. Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed at a bilateral meeting there were limits to their patience with Pyongyang's failure to honour a nuclear disarmament agreement. "What I have been advised is that it (was) a cruise missile test," White House National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley told reporters. "We saw I think in the last week or 10 days a similar test." A South Korean Defence Ministry official confirmed reclusive communist North Korea had fired at least one missile but could not specify the exact number or type. White House National Security spokesman Gordon Johndroe said North Korea's missile test activity was "not constructive" and Pyongyang should focus on dismantling its nuclear programme. "The United States and our allies believe that North Korea should refrain from testing missiles," Johndroe said in a statement to reporters on the sidelines of a Group of Eight (G8) summit in Heiligendamm, Germany. BARRAGE North Korea fired a barrage of long and short range missiles last year, triggering United Nations sanctions. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged fellow G8 leaders to keep up the pressure on North Korea over its nuclear programme, Japanese officials said on Thursday. "We cannot allow the development of nuclear weapons by North Korea," one official quoted Abe as saying at the opening of a working lunch. Pyongyang has refused to implement a February 13 deal with South Korea, the United States, Russia, China and Japan under which it agreed to begin shutting down its nuclear programme in return for energy aid.

'Purity' ring case taken to High Court
LONDON A teenage schoolgirl will appeal to the High Court on Friday to overturn a ban on her wearing a "purity ring" at school to symbolize her decision to abstain from sex before marriage. Lydia Playfoot, 16, from West Sussex, says the silver ring is an expression of her faith and should be exempt from the school's rules on wearing jewellery. "It is really important to me because in the Bible it says we should do this," she told BBC radio. "Muslims are allowed to wear headscarves and other faiths can wear bangles and other types of jewellery. It feels like Christians are being discriminated against." Playfoot's lawyers will argue that her right to express religious belief is upheld by the Human Rights Act. There have been a series of rows in schools in recent years over the right of pupils to wear religious symbols or clothing, such as crucifixes and veils. That case echoed a debate in France over the banning of Muslim headscarves in state schools. 4:3-4," a reference to a Biblical passage from Thessalonians which reads: "God wants you to be holy, so you should keep clear of all sexual sin."

Leahy: Congress willing to 'go to court' over W.H. subpoena standoff
The White House won't release documents on domestic surveillance or allow aides to testify on US attorney firings. A flurry of subpoenas is pushing Congress and President Bush toward a historic clash over executive powers that could wind up in the courts. For now, lawmakers are targeting two issues: the dismissal of nine US attorneys and the Bush administration's authorization of warrantless domestic surveillance. If the president does not comply with these subpoenas Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy said he will seek to cite the White House for criminal contempt of Congress. But the outcomes of these disputes also could tip the balance of powers between Congress and the executive branch for a generation. "It feels like a climactic moment," says Julian Zelizer, a congressional historian at Princeton University. "The Bush administration has been about presidential power since they took office – even before 9/11." "We've seen a push by Vice President Cheney to reverse everything that happened in the 1970s and fully restore the powers of the presidency. At issue is whether lawmakers have a right to question, under oath, two senior White House aides on the attorney firings, which critics say were motivated for improper political reasons or to squelch ongoing corruption investigations. If subpoenas for two former aides to testify are not withdrawn by the response date of July 12, Mr. Bush will also cite executive privilege in not permitting them to appear, said a senior administration official in a briefing last week. "For the president to perform his constitutional duties, it is imperative that he receive candid and unfettered advice," said White House counsel Fred Fielding, in a letter to the Senate and House Judiciary committees last week. In March, Bush offered to allow aides to answer questions in a closed meeting with some committee members, without a transcript and not under oath.

'Precautionary' explosions Controlled explosions have been carried out on a car at a Glasgow mosque and at a station in Hammersmith, west London. British Transport Police said explosives experts performed a controlled explosion on three fire extinguishers left on a pavement outside Hammersmith Tube station, which serves the District and Piccadilly lines. Three explosions were also carried out on the car in Glasgow as a precaution, but Strathclyde Police said there had been "absolutely no specific information" regarding a threat. The man detained at Brisbane airport was an Indian national who had been trying to return to India with a one-way ticket, he added.

Queensland Premier Peter Beattie said the detained man had been working at the hospital since September, and that he had been based in Liverpool when he answered an advert in the British Medical Journal in March 2006. Dr Haneef is known to have previously worked at Halton Hospital in Runcorn, Cheshire.

Nigerian gunmen kidnap three-year-old British girl
Mrs Hill says her husband was willing to give-in to the demands Margaret Hill, the daughter of an expatriate worker, was grabbed from a car on her way to school in the oil city of Port Harcourt. Her mother, Oluchi, told the BBC that the kidnappers had called her demanding a meeting in a town in the Niger Delta. Margaret was snatched by gunmen at 0730 (0630 GMT) on Thursday after they smashed a window of her car as it stood in traffic. They say I can bring my husband to swap with the baby Oluchi Hill Oil rich city's woes Oil worker recalls kidnap Her father Mike Hill, who has lived in the country for 10 years, runs a bar in Port Harcourt. "We will join in the hunt for the monsters who carried out this abduction and mete out adequate punishment for this crime - We abhor all forms of violence against women and children," the group said in an e-mail sent to AP. Mrs Hill, a Nigerian national, said the kidnappers told her to meet them in a town in Bayelsa State in the Niger Delta region, but that neither she nor the police had been able to locate it. "They say I can bring my husband to swap with the baby," she said. "He wanted to go down for his baby but the police commander told him not to." The kidnappers then threatened to kill Margaret if Mr Hill did not come within three hours, she said.

Poll of 100 million votes names new Seven Wonders of the World
The world's most wondrous wonder is actually the computer. Millions of people from across the globe joined in what was essentially a huge publicity stunt, voting via the Internet to choose a new list of the Seven Wonders of the World, announced Saturday. And the seven winners, announced on the seventh day of the seventh month in the year '07, were: The Great Wall of China, the ancient city of Petra in Jordan, the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Machu Picchu in Peru, the Maya ruins of Chichen Itza in Mexico, the Colosseum in Rome and India's Taj Mahal. The lucky seven represented a collection of mystical, centuries-old places and more modern constructions of limited transcendence -- chosen in a decidedly unscientific poll. "We are celebrating the cultural diversity of our world," proclaimed actor Ben Kingsley, co-host of a glitzy ceremony late Saturday in Lisbon's Stadium of Light, where the winners were announced amid highly orchestrated fanfare. The popularity contest was the creation six years ago of Bernard Weber, a Swiss filmmaker and self-styled adventurer. Nearly 200 early candidate sites chosen by Internet balloting were scaled down by a panel of experts to 21 finalists, each from a different country, from Greece's Acropolis to the Statue of Liberty. Online and telephone call-in voting on the finalists began a little over a year ago. Nothing prevented repeat voting by fans, citizens, governments, tourism agencies, you name it. Weber promoted the project with flashy appearances in hot-air balloons, on camelback and inside a blue blimp, traveling to each of 21 final candidates. In developing countries where the Internet is taking off, such as China, millions of people enthusiastically cast votes for their favorite monuments. Since the Great Wall was one of the candidates (and a winner), it was an easy guess just where most of those votes went.

Face-off at Islamabad Mosque
Troops are blocking all entrances and roads to the mosque Ejaz-ul-Haq said the militants were "hardened terrorists" holding women and children hostage inside the Red Mosque. The Pakistani army has kept a tight grip on the mosque, also known as Lal Masjid, since fighting began last week. The mosque's leader, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, said he and his followers would commit suicide rather than surrender. An army commander was shot dead by students inside the mosque on Sunday. At least 21 people have been killed since the stand-off began last Tuesday. Abdul Rashid Ghazi said as many as 1,800 followers remained in the mosque, although this cannot be verified. 'Al-Qaeda links' Mr ul-Haq told the BBC that between two and five of the militants were wanted in connection with "high-profile cases". Mr ul-Haq said the government became aware of the militants' presence after a man killed on the first day of the siege was identified as Maqsood Ahmed, a member of Jaish-e-Mohammad, an outlawed radical Muslim organisation which has been linked to al-Qaeda. Ahmed was wanted in connection with an assassination attempt against Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in the northern Pakistani town of Attock in 2004. He says those inside are students of his religious school and he is in charge.

US Immigrants protest Green Card delays with flowers
Shyam Bindingnavale had spent years of anguish in pursuit of permanent residency, so when the government offered him an opportunity to apply for it and then abruptly snatched it away, he was furious and deeply disappointed. Bindingnavale, 36, a Gaithersburg resident and financial analyst working here on an H1B visa for skilled technical workers, struck back the most effective way he could imagine: He sent flowers to Emilio Gonzalez, the director of the U.S. So did about 200 other green card applicants, most of them professionals, natives of India and working legally in this country. Yesterday, their bouquets of purple roses, pink lilies and yellow daisies, which cost about $40 each and which were sent from all over the country, piled up on the immigration office's loading dock at 20 Massachusetts Ave. NW, addressed to Gonzalez and stacked in columns taller than people. "We know the reason behind it and understand the symbolism. We donated them in the same spirit in which they were provided to us," said an agency official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lawsuit over the matter filed by an advocacy group. Green card applicants were given hope on June 12, when the State Department posted a bulletin offering H1B visa holders who had been stuck in a bureaucratic logjam an opportunity to take that last step needed to apply for permanent residency.

New gambling review could jeopardize UK's 'supercasino' plans
Manchester put forward the winning bid for the UK's first super-casino Whitehall sources told the BBC the idea of using a super-casino to regenerate run-down areas was "dead in the water". The PM promised a report on the "social effects" of gambling by September. But Manchester MP Graham Stringer said it would be a "weak and bad decision" if the city's successful bid to build the first super-casino was overturned. 'No consensus' During prime minister's questions, Mr Brown was told by Labour MP Andy Reed that most people thought super-casinos would make gambling addiction worse. The prime minister replied the issue would be "subject to reflection over the next few months". "In September we will have a report that will look at gambling in our country - the incidence and prevalence of it and the social effects of it," Mr Brown said. "I hope that during these summer months we can look at whether regeneration in the areas for the super-casinos maybe a better way of meeting their economic and social needs than the creation of super-casinos." In January, Manchester was named the preferred site for such an attraction at the expense of Blackpool, whose supporters said it would benefit more. SMALL CASINOS Bath and North East Somerset Dumfries and Galloway East Lindsey Luton Scarborough Swansea Torbay Wolverhampton But in March, peers rejected the plan by just three votes, after MPs had backed it by a majority of 24. The policy had been backed by former prime minister Tony Blair, who said in May that he thought both Manchester and Blackpool should get super-casinos, if there was sufficient investment. 'Bad decision' Mr Stringer told the BBC he had heard nothing about the review until prime minister's questions.

Tour de France: Michael Rasmussen wins stage 8
By Martin Gough  Rasmussen has been King of the Mountains in the last two years Denmark's Michael Rasmussen went it alone for victory in Tignes to secure the Tour de France yellow jersey. He went solo on the last climb to finish two minutes and 47 seconds ahead of Iban Mayo and 5:04 clear of Linus Gerdemann, now second overall. Alexandre Vinokourov and Andreas Kloeden both lost 4:29 while Michael Rogers crashed out of the race. T-Mobile leader Rogers was in the same group as Rasmussen - and the race leader on the road - on the descent of the Cormet de Roseland when he hit a roadside barrier. 606: DEBATE There's plenty of time to consider strategy over the rest day FR He bravely carried on before being forced to pull up later with a dislocated shoulder. "It's a real shame because I could see the yellow jersey," he said. "One moment I was in the lead, the next I was lying on the ground with my back wheel where my front wheel should have been." O'Grady was taken to hospital after a crash on the same descent as Rogers while McEwen, who won the first stage in Canterbury last Sunday, was eliminated from the race after finishing outside the 40-minute time limit. X-rays showed that O'Grady broke five ribs in the fall, as well as fracturing three vertebrae and a shoulder blade. This could be my year as the Pyrenees are extremely difficult but, again, I need to improve in the time trials Michael Rasmussen After a stage which included three category-one climbs, Rasmussen also took the lead in the King of the Mountains competition, which he has won overall for the last two years. Asked if he would aim to take the yellow jersey in Paris in a fortnight's time he said: "The way I'm riding, I would be stupid not to."

The action prompted weary and frustrated Senate Democrats to postpone consideration of other measures to bring the war to an end. On a vote of 52-47, backers fell short of the needed 60 to clear a Republican procedural hurdle and move toward passage of an April 30, 2008, deadline for removing U.S. combat troops from Iraq. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada responded by suspending consideration on a defense policy bill until Republicans drop procedural tactics that prevented passage of the withdrawal plan. One is to pass a defense authorization bill, but with a deadline dealing with Iraq," Reid said.

Documents show Fred Thompson worked for Pro-Choice group
Giuliani tries new campaign strategy by nurturing relationships with reporters and driving coverage with his own message. Giuliani catches up on organization After months of tough press and a corresponding drop in his once-soaring poll numbers, Rudy Giuliani’s campaign has put a new strategy in place, nurturing relationships with reporters and trying to drive coverage with its own messaging. Mastering some of the basic fundamentals of the modern presidential campaign simply hasn't come easily for Giuliani, who started his quest much later than his GOP peers and has sometimes seemed to have difficulty adjusting to the umatched scrutiny of a run for the White House. Story Continued Below But the campaign of the former New York mayor seems to be finding its equilibrium. Just this week, the campaign has e-mailed 24 press releases, research documents and advisories to the national media—about twice as many as it would have sent in any given week earlier in the year. Also this week, the campaign began sending a daily e-mail alerting reporters to the message of the day and Giuliani’s schedule. Additionally, campaign staff have engaged individual reporters on a near-daily basis, seeking to get ahead of the news cycle. Perhaps most important, the campaign has started bracketing news announcements with complementary messaging designed to drive home Giuliani's agenda. For example, Giuliani did not simply announce his promise to appoint constructionist justices to the bench—part of his so-called “12 Commitments” policy plan. Rather, his campaign held a press conference Tuesday unveiling his “Justice Advisory Committee,” a group of lawyers whose purpose is to reassure conservatives of the pro-choice candidate’s intentions. It attacked the messengers as Democratic water-carriers and lined up two retired firefighters to counter the criticism in a news conference. This blocking and tackling goes hand-in-hand with running for president in 2007, but the forward-leaning approach is new for a national frontrunner whose campaign infrastructure has not matched his standing in the polls.

AKP secures mandate in Turkish general election
By Sarah Rainsford BBC News, Ankara  Unofficial results prompted wild street celebrations by supporters Turkey's powerful military warned it would intervene to protect the republic, if required. This Sunday, 46.4% of the electorate cast their votes for the AKP across the country, proving they did not believe in any such danger. It was a resounding victory and, as the results rolled in, there was euphoria at the brand new party headquarters in the city. Hundreds of people thronged outside, waving orange and blue party flags. There was singing and dancing in the streets. Passing cars were draped in party flags too, passengers hanging out of the windows. It will be very good for Turkey," said Sadi, one of the supporters. He voted for the AKP so democratic reforms would continue, moving Turkey closer to the European Union. So does this second term success mean Turkish society is becoming more religious and more introverted? "Today nearly half of the people voted AKP, and half of all people here do not want Turkey to be an Islamic society," he explained.

Major earthquake strikes Peru followed by multiple large aftershocks
Peru quake kills 500, bodies in streets Updated Peruvians pulled hundreds of dead and wounded from the rubble of homes and churches overnight and some gathered them on street corners after a massive earthquake ravaged the country's central coast. About 500 people were killed and a further 1,600 injured in the 8.0-magnitude quake on Thursday, the president's chief of staff said. As rescuers scrambled through the debris in search of survivors, dazed residents guarded bodies in the street, not sure where to take them. The US Geological Survey upgraded the quake's magnitude to 8.0 from an earlier 7.9 measurement, and powerful aftershocks rattled the country. Many mud-brick houses crumbled, residents placed the bodies of relatives and neighbours on street corners and hospitals were overwhelmed with injured in Chincha and the nearby city of Pisco. On the road into Chincha, which lies 200 kilometres south of the capital Lima and is home to some 170,000 people, fuel tanks and merchandise were spilled onto highways where trucks had turned over when the quake buckled the pavement. Wounded people lay on the floor in Chincha's San Jose hospital, where walls were destroyed by the quake. Prisoners escape Hundreds of prisoners ran out of Chincha's Tambo de Mora prison, an old building that collapsed during the earthquake. In the San Juan de Dios hospital in Pisco, doctor Ricardo Cabrera said staff was struggling to cope with 200 wounded and more than 40 dead, with no power and a large part of the hospital damaged. "There are a lot of bodies still in the rubble," Dr Cabrera told RPP radio, calling for blood, bandages and medicines.

Jose Padilla found guilty of supporting terrorism
MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Former Chicago gang member Jose Padilla was found guilty Thursday of supporting Islamic terrorism overseas. Jose Padilla was originally accused of planning a "dirty bomb" attack in the United States. Co-defendants Adham Hassoun and Kifan Jayyousi were also found guilty of the three counts charged: conspiracy to murder, kidnap, and maim people in a foreign country; conspiracy to provide material support for terrorists; and providing material support for terrorists. Padilla was originally arrested on accusations that he planned to set off radioactive "dirty bombs" in the United States. Thursday's convictions are not related to those accusations, and prosecutors did not present the "dirty bomb" plot to the jury. A federal court jury in Miami deliberated for just under two days before handing down the verdict. Watch latest news of Padilla verdict from CNN's Susan Candiotti » All three defendants face life in prison when they are sentenced on December 5. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales -- who is on vacation this week -- issued a statement saying, "The conviction of Jose Padilla -- an American who provided material support to terrorists and trained for violent jihad -- is a significant victory in our efforts to fight the threat posed by terrorists and their supporters." "We commend the jury for its work in this trial and thank it for upholding a core American principle of impartial justice for all," the statement said. Defense attorneys argued at trial that Padilla went overseas only to study Islam. Padilla's mother, Estela Lebron, told CNN her son will appeal the verdict. "I'm not surprised by anything in this place anymore," she said.

An important part of them managed to get out, said the sources, adding that some passengers were injured. Sources also said that the hijackers are still holding nine passengers and two crew members as hostages. The hijackers wanted to fly the plane to Iranian capital city of Tehran after it took off from the Ercan Airport in Nicosia in northern Cyprus at 07:15 a.m. local time (0415 GMT), according to the report. One of the hijackers was speaking Arabic and had a knife and the other was carrying a package that he claimed to be a bomb, Anatolia reported. Other media reported that the two hijackers claimed they were from al-Qaida, an escaped passenger told NTV television. When pilots said they needed to refuel, the hijackers tried to storm the cockpit but they could not manage it, Anatolia said, adding that they took one of the hostesses hostage and threatened to harm her. The plane later landed at an airport in the southern Turkish city of Antalya for refueling and the pilots left the airplane, said the report. There are 136 passengers and six crew members on board the plane, operated by the private Turkish airline company Atlas Jet, it added.

Horse flu spreads in Australia
Flu crisis spreads to Randwick Updated Australia's horse flu crisis deepened this morning when symptoms were reported in thoroughbred racehorses for the first time. All track work has been stopped at Sydney's Randwick Racecourse after three horses developed higher than normal temperatures. One of the horses involved is from the stable of star trainer Gai Waterhouse while another is being trained by 'Cups King' Bart Cummings. "We have spoken to the chief veterinarian and organised to have those horses tested immediately and for the tests to go out to the Menangle government laboratory for analysis," he said. "It's a precaution, these horses have got elevated temperatures. "Two of the horses have only got slightly elevated temperatures, but in the current circumstances we're not prepared to take any risks whatsoever." More cases in Warwick At least 10 horses at the Morgan Park site in Warwick, in southern Queensland, are now showing signs of the virus, but vets there have not yet confirmed a flu diagnosis. Blood samples have been sent to a laboratory in Victoria and the results are not expected until later this week. Queensland Racing chairman Bob Bentley has called for an inquiry into the outbreak, which has brought the racing industry to its knees. Mr Bentley says industry officials are working on a plan with the Queensland Department of Primary Industries that would provide exclusion zones for owners wanting to work their horses.

U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales resigns
Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, one of President Bush's closest confidants and a key architect of his controversial counterterrorism policies, announced yesterday that he is quitting after seven months of bitter confrontation with Congress over his honesty and his competence to run the Justice Department. His resignation, submitted Sunday to President Bush and disclosed yesterday, removes one of the nation's most controversial attorneys general since the Watergate era. He will leave behind a Justice Department battered by allegations that partisan politics has infected its law enforcement mission. Gonzales had long been a lightning rod for critics of the administration's harsh interrogation policies, its secret overseas prisons and its expanded domestic surveillance -- all supported by legal analyses conducted under his supervision or with his concurrence. But his political undoing stemmed from his tangled account of having approved the dismissals of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 while denying detailed knowledge of the circumstances or reasons. The events that led to his resignation began with a Democratic-led inquiry into those firings, and they included accusations that Gonzales had lied to lawmakers. Most of his senior aides have already departed, and Congress is now locked in conflict with the White House over its access to documents related to Gonzales's decision-making. Gonzales will be replaced temporarily by Solicitor General Paul D. Clement, and Bush could name a permanent nominee for the job by the end of this week, White House officials said. Lawmakers began floating names of possible replacements yesterday, but administration officials insisted that no candidate has been tagged. But within the past week, Justice aides and other officials said, Gonzales concluded that his credibility with Congress, his employees and the public was so shattered that he could not promise to remain through the end of Bush's term, as the White House chief of staff had demanded of Cabinet officers. Gonzales, a son of migrant workers and the nation's first Hispanic attorney general, gave no reason for his departure during a brief news appearance in Washington, emphasizing his "remarkable journey" from a poor childhood in Texas to the height of power in Washington. Bush told reporters yesterday that he accepted Gonzales's resignation reluctantly, casting his friend as the victim of "months of unfair treatment that has created a harmful distraction at the Justice Department."

Iran unveils part of its nuclear program
The World Tehran sharing more nuclear data, agency says Iran is still enhancing its effort to enrich uranium but the endeavor falls well short of capacity, a U.N. report declares. But U.S. and European officials suspect that Iran's network of nuclear facilities masks a clandestine effort to obtain technology that could be used in the making of an atomic bomb. They have threatened to impose a fourth round of sanctions on Tehran when the United Nations Security Council takes up the issue again, probably next month. Iran insists that its nuclear program is meant to meet its civilian energy needs. In theory, about 3,000 centrifuges operating at full capacity for a year could produce enough material to make one bomb. Iran says it has mastered the technology and that a plant in the city of Natanz has the capacity to operate 50,000 centrifuges. Experts doubt these claims. According to the report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran operates 1,968 centrifuges for producing enriched uranium that could ultimately be used to make nuclear weapons or generate electricity, a 50% increase over the number it had on line in April. However, the uranium has been enriched to only 3.7%, far less than the 90% estimated to be necessary for weapons-grade material. CAIRO — Iran continues to expand its ability to enrich uranium, but is operating far below capacity and cooperating more fully in clearing up questions about its efforts, a U.N. report said Thursday. The report warns, however, that Iran needs "to continue to build confidence about the scope and nature of its present and future nuclear program."

Adventurer Steve Fossett missing
By David Willis BBC News, Nevada  The airport in Minden is serving as a base for the rescue effort Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft took turns to taxi down the narrow runway. More than a dozen are playing their part in the hunt for Steve Fossett. I took a flight in a small Cessna aircraft over the area from which Steve Fossett took off on Monday. It is high desert dotted with mountain valleys and ravines. Spotting the millionaire adventurer and his single-engine blue and white plane would be a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack. High winds have also hampered the search effort making it difficult for planes to fly low enough for their pilots to peer into the gulleys. No signal Since Steve Fossett did not file a flight plan the search area is immense - more than 600 sq miles (1,554 sq km). Maj Cynthia Ryan, of the Civil Air Patrol, said it could take a week to search the entire area. She is confident Steve Fossett will be found, although when I put it to her that his silence seemed ominous she agreed. Given Steve Fossett's experience - he has circumnavigated the globe no fewer than five times - the question is how could a freak joyride have gone so wrong? Steve Fossett not only had plenty of fuel when he set out, he also had with him a radio and a cell phone, and the aircraft was fitted with an electronic beacon. Maj Ryan said no signal had been received from the beacon, which suggested that it had either developed a fault with the battery, or been destroyed or submerged in water. Millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett, who has cheated death time and again in his successful pursuit of aviation records, was missing Tuesday after taking off in a single-engine plane the day before to scout locations for a land-speed record, officials said. Teams searched a broad swath of rugged terrain in western Nevada near the ranch where he took off, but searchers had little to go on because he apparently didn't file a flight plan, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said.

2007 Rugby World Cup: New Zealand, Australia and England open with wins
By James Standley  Winger Sitiveni Sivivatu grabbed a first-half brace for the All Blacks New Zealand (43) 76 Tries: McCaw 2, Howlett 3, Muliaina, Sivivatu 2, Jack, Collins 2 Cons: Carter 7, McAlister 2 Pens: Carter McCaw 2, Howlett 3, Muliaina, Sivivatu 2, Jack, Collins 2Carter 7, McAlister 2Carter Italy (7) 14 Tries: Stanoevic, Mirco Bergamasco Cons: Bortolussi, de Marigny Favourites New Zealand laid down a World Cup marker by destroying Italy in their opening game in Marseille. Richie McCaw (2), Doug Howlett, Mils Muliaina and Sitiveni Sivivatu (2) scored before Marko Stanojevic crossed for Italy to make it 43-7 at the break. The All Blacks added further tries through Chris Jack, Howlett (2) and Jerry Collins (2), before Mirco Bergamasco grabbed a consolation try. Star All Blacks fly-half Dan Carter landed 17 points with the boot. Italy have a reputation as a physical, abrasive unit but they were taken apart by the All Blacks in a devastating opening quarter. New Zealand have a history of peaking between World Cups but since losing in the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament they have won 38 of their 43 Tests. 606: DEBATE They thrilled the passionate 60,000 crowd at Olympique Marseille's Velodrome stadium by performing their traditional pre-match Ka Mate haka, rather than the Kapa O Panga haka they have used frequently over the past couple of years. The Italians chose to spurn the challenge by going into a group huddle and they seemed to turn their backs once again just 60 seconds into the game. All Blacks second row Ali Williams peeled round the back of a line-out and New Zealand captain McCaw romped over untouched from the 22. McCaw, the IRB player of the year in 2006, added his second try just six minutes later before two Carter conversions and a penalty put the tournament favourites 17-0 up after just 11 minutes. Italy looked shell-shocked and a panicky kick soon landed in the hands of the lethal Sivivatu, who sparked a sweeping passing move ended by Howlett in the far corner. The battered Azzurri tried to respond by imposing themselves physically, but twice Carter saw their blitz defence coming, twice he chipped over the thin blue line and twice the All Blacks scored. Muliania and Sivivatu were the lucky recipients and, with Carter maintaining his 100% success rate with the boot, the tournament favourites had 38 points on the board after just 18 minutes.

2007 Rugby World Cup: South Africa, Wales, Scotland and Ireland win
Wales finally won enough ball to allow their backs to show their class Wales (9) 42 Tries: Parker, AW Jones, Williams (2), Charvis Cons: Jones (4) Pens: Hook (3) Parker, AW Jones, Williams (2), CharvisJones (4)Hook (3) Canada (12) 17 Tries: Cudmore, Culpan, Williams Cons: Pritchard  Wales survived a huge scare in their opening World Cup match before overcoming a determined Canada side. Canada led 17-9 after 45 minutes in Nantes after tries from Jamie Cudmore, Craig Culpan and Morgan Williams. But the introduction of Stephen Jones and Gareth Thomas sparked Wales to life as they dominated the last half hour. Sonny Parker, Alun Wyn Jones, Colin Charvis and Shane Williams (2) crossed to ensure the victory which had looked a distant dream for the Welsh side. Wales, wearing black armbands in honour of former Welsh Rugby Union president Sir Tasker Watkins who died on Sunday, lined up in unfamiliar grey jerseys. And the dullness of their shirts was matched by their play in the opening exchanges as they struggled to find any cohesion. 606: DEBATE Gareth Jenkins is no clearer in knowing exactly his best XV BBC Sport's Nabil Hassan They at least managed to force Canada to concede penalties in their own half, and James Hook kicked three of his four attempts to put Wales 9-0 up after 15 minutes. Canada's intentions were clear after picking a strong and experienced pack, and their opening try on 25 minutes all down to forward power. A scrum deep in Wales 22 provided the perfect attacking platform, and Cudmore eventually barged his way over from a few yards out as Wales buckled under heavy pressure. Shanklin was Wales' most potent attacking threat in Nantes The score looked inevitable, and it was Williams who finally borrowed his way through.

General Petraeus: 30,000 troops may be able to leave Iraq by next summer
Gen. David Petraeus told Congress on Monday he envisions the withdrawal of roughly 30,000 U.S. troops by next summer, beginning with a Marine contingent later this month. In long-awaited testimony, the commanding general of the war said last winter's buildup in U.S. troops had met its military objectives "in large measure." As a result, he told a congressional hearing and a nationwide television audience, "I believe that we will be able to reduce our forces to the pre-surge level ... by next summer without jeopardizing the security gains we have fought so hard to achieve." Petraeus unleashed a volley of numbers to support his claim the surge is working, reports CBS News national security correspondent David Martin. He said the number of attacks in Iraq is lower than at any time in more than a year; civilian deaths are down by 45 percent; and sectarian killings are down by 55 percent. But the charts show violence is still high, running at levels comparable to 2005, before the bombing of the Samarra mosque triggered sectarian fighting that nearly tore Iraq apart, adds Martin. Testifying in a military uniform bearing four general's stars and a chestful of medals, Petraeus said he had already provided his views to the military chain of command. It has not been cleared by nor shared with anyone in the Pentagon, the White House or the Congress." But Crocker, evaluating Iraq's ability to govern itself, the ultimate goal of the surge, has a lot fewer success stories to point to than Petreaus, reports CBS News chief White House correspondent Jim Axelrod, with a paralyzed parliament unable so far to pass major laws that would foster Sunni-Shiite reconciliation.

2007 Rugby World Cup: Tonga, Fiji and Italy win
Finau Maka crossed over for Tonga in the first two minutes USA: (3) 15 Tries: MacDonald, Stanfill Con: Hercus Pens: Hercus Tonga: (13) 25 Tries: Maka, Vaka, Vaki Cons: Hola 2 Pens: Hola 2 Tonga got their World Cup campaign off to a winning start with victory over a battling USA in Montpellier. The Americans found themselves 13-0 down after 26 minutes thanks to an early try from Toulouse flanker Finau Maka and two Pierre Hola penalties. Eagles prop Mike MacDonald made the score 13-8 with a try in the corner but Tonga responded through Joseph Vaka. USA flanker Louis Stanfill then crossed from close range but Viliami Vaki's superb score sealed victory for Tonga. The result was a disappointing one from America's point of view following on from their impressive display against England last weekend. 606: DEBATE They seemed to be feeling the effects of the quick turnaround and Tonga made an explosive start with Toulouse's Maka going over after a rolling maul from a line-out after 72 seconds. America settled however and restricted the combative Tongans to just two Hola penalties in the rest of the opening half. The Eagles, boosted by a Hercus penalty just before the break, dominated for long periods of the second period and twice got back to within a score of their opponents. MacDonald powered his way over to score in the corner on 46 minutes but Tonga responded with the help of an incisive break from skipper Nili Latu which led to Joseph Vaka scoring his first try for his country. America had renewed hope when Stanfill bundled over from his own tap penalty but Vaki struck the decisive blow with 10 minutes left - leaving the Eagles ruing their wasted opportunities. It's not often you get the chance to play in a World Cup and it's a good feeling to get a victory.

UK bank gets emergency support
Some customers were queuing outside Northern Rock branches But experts and officials insist that Northern Rock, which has £113bn in assets, is not in danger of going bust. Despite the reassurances lines of customers formed outside many Northern Rock branches around the UK. The bank has struggled to raise money to finance its lending ever since money markets seized up over the summer. Stock market hit NORTHERN ROCK FACTS Founded in 1965 after merger of Northern Counties Permanent Building Society and Rock Building Society Headquarters in Newcastle Became a public company in 1997 Has 6,400 staff Has 18.9% share of new UK lending Loans and assets of £113bn Deposits from customers of £24bn Northern Rock's share price What if a bank goes bust? Other bank shares fell, with Bradford & Bingley, Alliance & Leicester and HBOS down nearly 8%, 7% and 4% respectively. Unlike most banks, which get their money from customers making deposits into savings accounts, Northern Rock is built around its mortgage business. It raises most of the money which it provides for mortgages by borrowing from banks and other financial institutions. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Chancellor Alistair Darling said: "The problem here is there is a lot of money in the system but they are reluctant to lend it to each other at the moment." "Northern Rock can draw on them when it requires, but it means it can carry on trading, people can use their accounts in the normal way, they carry on making their mortgage payments in the usual way, Northern Rock will be able to carry on its business." Angela Knight, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, said that anybody who was "either a saver with Northern Rock or has got a mortgage... can be absolutely confident that they have got their money with or they have borrowed from a very sound financial institution."

Chris Langham given ten months for downloading child porn
Chris Langham was convicted in August on 15 charges Actor Chris Langham has been jailed for 10 months for downloading indecent videos of children from the internet. The Bafta-winning star of comedy dramas Help and The Thick Of It wept as he was sentenced at Maidstone Crown Court. He was convicted last month on 15 charges. Some of the videos accessed by Langham, 58, of Golford, Kent, showed the most "horrific level" of abuse. Langham will serve five months in prison, less the 43 days he has spent in custody already. The worst video was 15 minutes long and it showed in quite graphic detail the sadistic brutalisation of an eight-year-old girl in the UK Det Ch Insp Paul Fotheringham Langham's future behind bars He told Langham: "Some of the children viewed are clearly prepubescent, others are fully developed, some of the children are clearly of Filipino extract. "All have had inflicted upon them horrifying sexual abuse and, I want to make this absolutely clear to you, I must first think of those children. He added: "Your activity took place in the comfort of your own home, no doubt at the time feeling safe in the knowledge that you would never be caught." During his trial at Maidstone Crown Court Langham admitted viewing them but pleaded not guilty because he did not want to be labelled a paedophile. 'Abusive situations' Det Ch Insp Paul Fotheringham said: "Fifteen [images] is reasonably low to be honest, most police forces have probably had cases where they've had people with hundreds of thousands of images. "The worst video was 15 minutes long and it showed in quite graphic detail the sadistic brutalisation of an eight-year-old girl in the UK, with some serious sexual offences against her."

2007 Rugby World Cup: New Zealand, Australia and Ireland win
By James Standley  Jerry Collins enjoyed the chance to get his hands on the ball in space New Zealand: (52) 108 Tries: Rokocoko 2, Toeava, Williams, Mauger 2, Collins, Masoe, Hore, Leonard, Evans, Ellis, MacDonald, Smith 2, Hayman Cons: Evans 14 Rokocoko 2, Toeava, Williams, Mauger 2, Collins, Masoe, Hore, Leonard, Evans, Ellis, MacDonald, Smith 2, HaymanEvans 14 Portugal: (3) 13 Tries: Cordeiro Cons: D Pinto Pens: D Pinto Drop-goals: Malheiro New Zealand ran in 16 tries as they brushed aside Portugal in Lyon. Joe Rokocoko (2), Isaia Toeava, Ali Williams, Aaron Mauger, Jerry Collins, Chris Masoe and Andrew Hore went over for the All Blacks in the first half. They then added further scores through Nick Evans, Brendon Leonard, Andrew Ellis, Mauger, Leon MacDonald, Conrad Smith (2) and Carl Hayman. Portugal managed a converted Rui Cordeiro try to add to Goncalo Malheiro's earlier drop goal. The Portuguese, 22nd in the world, had eagerly awaited their opportunity to meet the world's top ranked team and they visibly relished the chance to face the haka. Italy had spurned the challenge when they met the All Blacks and conceded a try within two minutes, but Portugal held out twice as long before Rokocoko scythed through to score. The winger soon added a second try, but the next score went to Portugal as Malheiro, their all-time record points scorer, drilled over a fine drop-goal. The All Blacks, the tournament favourites, said they would be "sensitive" up against a largely amateur team, but conceding points was not part of the deal and the drop-goal had the same effect as poking a wasps' nest. New Zealand started to swarm over Os Lobos and, in the last 18 minutes of the first half, added further tries by Toeava, Williams, Mauger, Collins, Masoe and Hore. Amazingly, the first score of the second half went to Portugal as Cordeiro finished off a series of close-range drives. But Leonard rapidly hit back for the All Blacks and, although Portugal defended bravely, Evans, Ellis, Mauger, MacDonald, Smith, who grabbed a double, and Hayman all crossed as the floodgates opened once more. Evans converted 14 tries and claimed a personal haul of 33 points as New Zealand finished well short of the record 145 points they ran up against Japan in 1995. "We started a little slower than last week and that was credit to the Portuguese but we got into a rhythm.

2007 Rugby World Cup: Fiji, Tonga and France win
By James Standley  Saracens winger Kameli Ratuvou was a constant threat for Fiji Fiji (15) 29 Tries: Leawere, Ratuvou 2, Delasau Cons: Little 3 Pens: Little Leawere, Ratuvou 2, DelasauLittle 3Little Canada (6) 16 Tries: Smith Cons: Pritchard Pens: Pritchard 3 Fiji kept in the hunt for a place in the World Cup quarter-finals with a bonus-point win over Canada in Pool B. Canada hit back, with Ryan Smith's try and James Pritchard's third penalty trimming the gap to six points. But Ratuvou's late try ended Canada's hopes as Fiji stay on course for what is likely to be a winner takes all contest against Wales on 29 September. The game was always going to be a clash of styles, with Canada relying on their forward strength and a more structured approach to combat Fiji's greater pace, power and skill out wide. However, Fiji tried to take Canada on with a deliberate game initially, kicking several penalties for touch, and a penalty apiece from James Pritchard and Nicky Little saw the sides level at 3-3 after the early exchanges. Fiji were making little headway until Saracens winger Ratuvou, playing at full-back for Fiji, injected some pace into the game. First he sliced through to within a couple of yards of the line before losing the ball in a tackle. A couple of minutes later he smashed his way through the first line of defence and when Fiji switched play to the right, second row Leawere was on hand to blast over by the posts. Little converted to make it 10-3 and although Pritchard narrowed the gap with his second penalty after 26 minutes, within two minutes Fiji had stretched their lead as Ratuvou once again stamped his mark on the game. Number eight Sisa Koymaibole's charge took Fiji within sight of the line and Ratuvou burst over from close range to make it 15-6 at half-time. The Fijians might be just one place higher than Canada in the world rankings at 12th, but whenever they secured decent possession they looked much more threatening. However, they hit back just before the hour mark when Smith slipped Little's tackle to score from close range after a sustained attack, with Pritchard's conversion making it 22-13.

Meteorite blamed for mysterious illness in Peru
Reports on a small Peruvian town’s plight over the past few days include more than a few elements to boggle the mind — and then to make you wonder whether an episode of “The X-Files” is playing out in real time. (To set the spooky mood, just watch this short video.) Stunned residents said they tracked it to a fresh hole in the earth that was more than 60 feet wide, 15 feet deep, filled with boiling water and steaming with noxious fumes, according to a statement from the Health Ministry. And then people started getting sick: more than 150 reported symptoms like dizziness, vomiting and skin lesions, according to a government statement quoted by Bloomberg News. The Associated Press reports that a local official confirmed through tests that a “rocky meteorite” created the crater. But a meteorite expert at the Natural History Museum in London, who was interviewed by BBC News, said that “increasingly we think that people witnessed a fireball,” which she said would not be uncommon, and that the hole in the ground was unrelated. After seeing the fire in the sky, the local people “went off to investigate, and found a lake of sedimentary deposit, which may be full of smelly, methane-rich organic matter,” Dr. Caroline Smith suggested. “This has been mistaken for a crater.” A NASA scientist interviewed by Space.com agreed, saying of the steaming pond that “statistically, it’s far more likely to have come from below than from above.” Adding to the confusion, the scientist concedes that the meteorite explanation was not impossible, but he would expect it to be a metal one, not the rocky one identified by tests at the scene. The local official who confirmed the meteorite strike also said that the water in the crater was boiling for 10 minutes, a detail that first emerged from witnesses in what appears to be the first English-language article about the incident, from Agence France-Presse. “And this is where the story falls apart,” a blogger at Wired writes, adding to that explanation in a post that started off, “Shades of the Andromeda Strain!

Maoists quit joint-government in Nepal
KATHMANDU: Even as pressure mounted on Nepal prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala to woo the Maoists back into the government and avert a crisis, a day after the rebels quit the government and trained their sights on the November election, reconciliation talks among the eight parties on Wednesday failed to appease the rebels. Though the leaders of the remaining seven parties in the ruling alliance said the parleys had been positive, the meeting started on a stormy note with Maoist supremo Prachanda staying away initially. Though scheduled to have started from 2 pm, the talks began almost two hours late sans Prachanda. After he finally made an appearance, the meet ended with an agreement to continue the talks. However, no date has been fixed for the next round of talks despite the gravity of the situation and with the constituent assembly election only 63 days away. One of the rebel leaders, Chandra Prakash Gajurel, who heads the Maoists' foreign affairs division, said at a public programme in the capital on Wednesday that his party would start collecting signatures for a campaign to convene parliament, bring a no-trust motion against Koirala and have two-thirds of the MPs declare Nepal a republic with the abolition of monarchy. Other party leaders however said that there was no immediate plan to do so but the step could be taken at an appropriate time. Calling the Maoist pullout unfortunate, visiting British minister for international development Shahid Malik met Koirala and urged him to hold the election in time. The pullout is the most serious setback to peace moves since the Maoists ended a 10-year insurgency last year.

2007 Rugby World Cup: South Africa, Australia and New Zealand qualify
By Rob Hodgetts  Giteau scored a brace and kicked 17 points for Australia Australia (22) 55 Tries: Giteau (2), Mitchell (3), Ashley-Cooper, Hoiles Cons: Giteau (4) Pens: Giteau (3) Drops: Barnes Giteau (2), Mitchell (3), Ashley-Cooper, HoilesGiteau (4)Giteau (3)Barnes Fiji (5) 12 Tries: Neivua, Ratuva Cons: Bai Cons: Lemi Australia romped to a comfortable 55-12 victory over a second-string Fiji in the Pool B clash in Montpellier. The Wallabies ran in seven tries to secure top spot in the group, setting up a likely quarter-final against either England or Tonga in Marseille. Fiji scored tries from Isoa Neivua and Aca Ratuva but the Wallabies were in training mode ahead of bigger tests. "It was a little bit scrappy in the first half, but we showed we are able to defend well at times," said man-of-the-match Giteau, who also kicked 17 points and won his 50th cap. Hopefully we will have a good performance against Canada and get ready for the quarter-finals." The Fijians, who were resting a host of top players, can still qualify for the knock-out stages if they beat Wales in the crunch match Nantes on 29 September. "We thought we had a few chances at end of first half to chase the score and I was pleased with the younger players coming through, knowing that we've got a tougher game against Wales next week," said Fiji coach Ilie Tabua. Australia took their time to unlock the Fiji defence and had to wait until 16 minutes for the first try after Wycliff Palu and Lote Tuqiri combined to put in Giteau. 606: DEBATE The Wallabies went close soon after when George Gregan, equalling Will Carling's record of 59 caps as captain, was foiled yards from the line after Rocky Elsom's break, but Fiji, to their credit, held off the next Australia score until the half hour mark. Full-back Chris Latham slipped a cute grubber kick through for winger Mitchell to gather and five minutes later Giteau added a second when he sneaked through following sustained Australian pressure. The Wallabies were cruising but right on the whistle, a textbook Fijian passing move down the three-quarters picked out left wing Neiuva, who outmuscled five Australian defenders to crash over. After the break, the hard-headed Australians spurned the chance to probe the corner with a penalty and took three more points through Giteau before Berrick Barnes added a drop-goal for good measure. Fiji, though, were not prepared to go through the motions as understudies and a dazzling break from replacement Mosese Raulini fed open-side Ratuva for his side's second try.

Merab Kvirikashvili landed two penalties and converted Akvsenti Guiorgadze's try to put the Lelos 13-0 up at the break. Kvirikashvili then kicked a third penalty and a conversion after Irakli Machkhaneli engineered a fine solo try. The Georgians added a third converted try when Davit Kacharava intercepted and raced clear at the death. Georgia won the inaugural meeting between the two sides 26-18 in June and they had the upper hand from the first whistle in northern France on Wednesday night. Namibia, in the south west of Africa, is generally hot and dry and their national side had reportedly not played in the rain for over 30 years. Georgia looked more comfortable from the start and they opened the scoring in the seventh minute after inside centre Irakli Giorgadze burst through the Namibian midfield. 606: DEBATE Namibia infringed at the resulting ruck and fly-half Kvirikashvili, who plays for French second division side Pau, landed the penalty. Namibia were struggling to get into the game and when they failed to find touch Malkhaz Urjukashvili counter attacked and took Georgia deep into Namibia territory. After a couple of phases they moved the ball to Kvirikashvili but his grubber kick between the posts ran dead before any of the Georgian chasers could get to it. When he dropped his third kick in a row it put the Eastern Europeans in deep trouble and they conceded a penalty for holding on at a ruck. It's our first victory - we're amateurs at winning Georgian flanker Rati Urushadze It was the first time Namibia had had a sniff of any points but fly-half Tertius Losper pushed his kick wide.

The All Blacks set out their intentions from the start with the first of Sivivatu's tries coming with less than a minute on the clock. 606: DEBATE From then on it was one-way traffic as the Romanians had no answer to New Zealand's fast attack and the All Blacks built up a 31-0 lead after 25 minutes. Romania showed some determination to take more from the contest early in the second half but the relentless All Blacks could not be contained. Rokocoko completed his hat-trick in the second half and his side finished with a flourish with replacement Doug Howlett stretching his all-time New Zealand try scoring record to 49. Sale-bound Luke McAllister kicked four goals with Evans notching six. With four wins out of four, the All Blacks will travel to Cardiff next weekend in confident mood to play France, Argentina or Ireland in the quarter-finals. "Romania played with a lot of passion and were very physical. "Overall we're pretty pleased, and we had no injuries, which is a pretty big plus.

2007 Rugby World Cup: Argentina and France qualify for quarter finals
By James Standley  Yannick Jauzion showed some sublime touches for France France (23) 64 Tries: Poitrenaud, Nyanga, Beauxis, Dominici 2, Bruno, Nallet, Martin, Bonnaire Cons: Beauxis 5 Pens: Beauxis 3 Poitrenaud, Nyanga, Beauxis, Dominici 2, Bruno, Nallet, Martin, BonnaireBeauxis 5Beauxis 3 Georgia (0) 7 Tries: Maisuradze Cons: Khamashuridze World Cup hosts France beat Georgia but the victory was not enough to help them avoid a quarter-final against favourites New Zealand in Cardiff. Tries from Clement Poitrenaud, Yannick Nyanga and Lionel Beauxis helped France into a 30-0 half-time lead. The win meant France briefly went top of the group but Argentina's win over Ireland relegated them to second place. France must now travel to Wales while Argentina, whose victory over the hosts in the first match of the tournament set them on their way to topping Pool D, will meet Scotland in Paris in the last eight. In the end it was a game too far for Georgia, who have lit up the World up with their never-say-die attitude. France took an early lead through a Beauxis penalty and he added the conversion after the classy Yannick Jauzion made a superb outside break to set up Poitrenaud, who glided over for the opening try. Georgia never gave up but France were ultimately too strong Beauxis, who scored 24 points in all, landed two further penalties either side of a missed penalty attempt by fly-half Merab Kvirikashvili for Georgia and France ran in two more tries before the break. Nyanga crossed down the blindside for the first before Beauxis went over after a neat scissors with Poitrenaud. Beauxis converted both scores to put France 30-0 up at the break and they scored their fourth try, earning a bonus point in the process, when Dominici latched onto the fly-half's inch-perfect cross-kick. Sale hooker Bruno marked his arrival with a score before Dominici latched onto a neat Jean-Baptiste Elissalde kick to grab his second. Nallet and Martin extended the lead before Zviad Maisuradze powered over for a converted try from a quick tap penalty to give the Georgian fans something to cheer about. There was a sour note late on, with Otar Eloshvili lucky not to be sent off after a shocking spear tackle on Martin, but overall Georgia's time in France has been a triumph. The hosts had the last word as number eight Bonnaire went over out wide but they must now travel outside French borders as they bid to keep their World Cup bid alive.

Thousands of trapped miners rescued in South Africa
The miners could only be brought to the surface in small groups The final group was lifted to safety from Elandsrand mine, 80km (50 miles) from Johannesburg, officials said. The accident had left the miners trapped 2.2km (1.4 miles) underground. The miners were brought out through a small shaft normally used for mining equipment. Only 75 workers could be hauled clear at a time, adding up to no more than 300 in an hour. 'Room for improvement' One of the last miners brought to safety, Richman Maneli, told AFP news agency he was happy to be out. "It has been 30 hours of suffering," he said. "We had no food, no water and we are exhausted." Earlier, another rescued miner, Granny Makad, told South Africa's Mail and Guardian newspaper many of the trapped miners were crying and believed they would die underground. "There was not enough air and they tried putting in more and ventilating the areas where we were trapped."

Darfur rebels threaten to pull out of peace talks
"Trust is being lost," says Andrew Natsios Andrew Natsios said the atmosphere between the governments of north and south Sudan had become poisonous. He said the Comprehensive Peace Agreement had to be addressed before the situation deteriorated further. At least 200,000 people have died and some two million forced from their homes during the four-year conflict in Darfur. Talks between Khartoum and rebel groups over Darfur are scheduled to begin in the Libyan capital on 27 October, although on Saturday a key rebel leader threatened to boycott them. 'Tension rising' Mr Natsios said it was hoped when the 2005 governmental peace deal was signed that the two enemies in war would be partners in peace. But he said that had not happened and described the governments of north and south Sudan as opponents unable to resolve their differences. Mr Natsios said: "We are deeply concerned with the health of the CPA. The important deadlines have been missed... and trust is slowly being lost." He said tensions, particularly along the border areas where armed units confront each other, were rising. Meanwhile, key rebel leader Khalil Ibrahim has threatened to boycott the Darfur peace talks if more than two rebel groups are invited. Mr Ibrahim, head of the Justice and Equality Movement (Jem), said only his group, a united Sudan Liberation Army and the government should participate. The BBC's Amber Henshaw says many fear the talks are doomed from the outset because the factions are not united and another key leader, Abdul Wahid al-Nur of the Sudan Liberation Army, is refusing to take part.

At least 150 militants and 50 Pakistani troops killed in clashes
Lahore, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani air force planes swooped down on the country's troubled tribal region on the border with Afghanistan Tuesday, launching a blistering airstrike that left as many as 50 militants dead, Pakistan Army sources said. The strike in the Miran Shah region was the latest salvo in intense fighting between Pakistani security forces and Taliban and al Qaeda militants that broke out Saturday, as the summer cease-fire crumbled even further. Those battles -- in North Waziristan, part of the country's largely lawless tribal region -- killed up to 150 militants, as well as 50 government troops, an army spokesman said. Another 20 security forces have been wounded. Intelligence sources said 12 to 15 soldiers remain missing. According to the army spokesman, the military operation, which was launched Sunday, will continue until peace is completely restored to North Waziristan. Pakistani officials offered few other details about the scope of the latest fighting which follows recent attacks on Pakistani security forces and a breakdown over the summer of a ceasefire between the Islamabad government and tribal leaders. That truce was blamed for an increase in attacks on U.S. troops over the border in Afghanistan, as Taliban fighters were able to prepare, train, and reconstitute weapons supplies without interference from the Pakistani government. The Taliban are the former Afghan regime that sheltered al Qaeda until the U.S.-led war following the September 11, 2001 attacks. U.S. intelligence officials say al Qaeda has established a "safe haven" in Waziristan, just over the border into Pakistan -- and that Osama bin Laden is believed to be in the area. American and NATO troops pushed the terrorist network and its Taliban allies out of power in Afghanistan following the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, but top leaders -- including al Qaeda mastermind bin Laden -- are believed to have found refuge in the mountainous border zone. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, cracked down on al Qaeda militants and arrested many in the Waziristan area before the truce was reached, but critics say he has failed to prevent the militants from gaining strength within the country. Tens of thousands of Pakistani civilians are fleeing a town on the border with Afghanistan following three days of fighting which has killed up to 250 people, locals and military officials said today. About 90% of the population of Mir Ali, a town of 50,000 people in the lawless north Waziristan region, has fled the fighting using cars and tractors or on foot, a local man told the Reuters news agency.

Shootings in Cleveland high school leave five injured, gunman dead
(CNN) -- It was only after a crowd of screaming students ran past Darnell Rodgers in a stairway at his Cleveland, Ohio, high school Wednesday afternoon that he realized he had been shot. Oh my God,'" said Rodgers, a senior at SuccessTech Academy near downtown Cleveland. Rodgers suddenly felt his arm "burning," he said, and realized he had been shot in the elbow. Police have started to piece together what happened. ET, 14-year-old gunman Asa Coon, who was a student at the school, walked the halls firing a gun in each hand, Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath said. When it was all over, five people had been shot, but the only fatality was Coon, who police said killed himself in a classroom. Police found a .22- caliber revolver and .38-caliber revolver near Coon's body, along with a box of ammunition and three knives, said McGrath. Investigators have reason to believe some victims were specifically targeted by Coon, who had been suspended from school Monday. Watch what happened at the school -- and the warning signs » "We do not believe this was a random shooting," McGrath said. "It may have been the teachers he went to the school looking for.

One of those arrested was Maori rights campaigner Tame Iti More than 300 police were involved in the operation, reportedly targeting Maori sovereignty and environmental activists - not foreign groups. Police Commissioner Howard Broad said those arrested had used firearms and other weapons at military-style training camps. The North Island raids were the first use of the country's Terrorism Suppression Act. The people targeted were from "a range of motivations" and from various ethnicities, the police chief said. "Based on the information and the activity known to have taken place, I decided it was prudent that action should be taken in the interests of public safety," Mr Broad said.

Australia Votes 2007: Liberals promise personal income tax cuts
Coalition keeps up pressure on Labor over tax Updated John Howard and Peter Costello have used a visit to a small business in the marginal New South Wales electorate of Eden-Monaro to push the Coalition's plan to progressively reduce the tax rates. Mr Costello says the Coalition is the only party to release a plan for Australia's economic future and he is continuing to pressure Labor to release its tax plan. Mr Howard says the Coalition's $34 billion proposal will encourage more people into work, or to start their own business. "Our tax plan is not just about putting extra dollars in the pockets of middle Australia but it's very much about further growth of the Australian economy," he said. "It's about providing additional incentives for people to work. Deputy Opposition Leader Julia Gillard says Labor will not be bullied into rushing out a tax policy, saying that John Howard took his time in 1996. "We know of course Mr Howard when he was opposition leader didn't announce his tax plan until weeks into the campaign," she said. "The big end of town has to be happy with Peter Costello's $34 billion tax cuts, but it's the wrong way for Australia," he said. "These tax cuts should have been channelled into making this country a fairer country." Rudd won't be pressured on tax policy Updated Federal Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd says he will not be rushed into releasing his tax policy. The Government today unveiled its first major campaign pledge,$34 billion in tax cuts over three years.

Turkish Parliament approves military action in Iraq
The vote came as relations between the countries were strained by a House committee’s passage last week of a bill calling the World War I-era mass killing of Armenians an act of genocide. In a nod to Turkey’s importance as an ally in Iraq, Congressional leaders began to back away on Wednesday from a commitment to hold a vote on that bill. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We are at a defining moment in Turkish-American relations,” said Morton Abramowitz, the American ambassador to Turkey during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, commenting on the Turkish vote. “This is a very big warning sign to the Americans and to the Iraqi Kurds.” Security experts here and in the United States agreed that Turkey was unlikely to cross the United States with a full-scale military operation. Still, the government is closer than it has been in years to military action of some sort, embarrassed into acting by a public angry over mounting deaths and what is seen as American inaction. More than two dozen Turks, some of them civilians, have been killed in cross-border rebel attacks in the past several weeks, and the powerful Turkish military which, unlike the government, has long been pressing for action, is fanning public anger.

Ilker Basbug, commander of the Turkish land forces, told villagers in Besagac that the killing of 12 Turks in late September by Kurdish rebels was “a crime against humanity,” according to Turkey’s official Anatolian News Agency. The vote itself drew responses from the leaders of three countries — the United States, Syria and Iraq — and set off a flurry of diplomacy as officials in several countries worked strenuously to avert military action.

'Large-scale attack' against ex-Prime Minister Bhutto leaves more than 100 dead in Pakistan
KARACHI, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 136 people were killed and more than 387 wounded around midnight Thursday in a suicide bombing near a motorcade carrying former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who returned to the country earlier in the day after eight years of self-imposed exile, according to hospital and police sources.

Two-horse race likely for leadership of UK Liberal Democrats
Nick Clegg will formally announce his bid to run for the Liberal Democrat leadership today, having already signed up more than twice as many MPs as his rival, Chris Huhne. The home affairs spokesman, regarded as the frontrunner in the race to succeed Sir Menzies Campbell, received a boost yesterday as the manifesto coordinator, Steve Webb, stood aside in his favour. Mr Webb's backing will help Mr Clegg ensure he cannot be portrayed by supporters of Mr Huhne as a rightwinger. But some senior Liberal Democrats are disappointed that Mr Webb, regarded as one of the party's leftwingers, is not standing. Lord Ashdown has also backed Mr Clegg. It is understood the former leader tried to persuade him to stand in the last leadership contest. Eighteen of the 63 Lib Dem MPs told the Guardian they would nominate the home affairs spokesman, while eight said they would back his rival. Mr Webb said he had the support of enough MPs to get on the ballot, but the "huge cost" to his family, and Mr Clegg's qualities, had persuaded him not to run. He added: "I believe that my work with colleagues on our policy platform has given us a firm foundation as a party. We now need a leader who will excel in communicating those core Lib Dem values and policies and who has the strategic political judgment that we need. Mr Clegg will today pay tribute to his "friend and colleague" Sir Menzies before laying out his vision for the party. He will warn that Liberal Democrats have to end their long period of "self-analysis" and look outwards to the concerns of the British people or risk irrelevance. Mr Clegg's early lead among his colleagues does not necessarily mean he will do so well among the Liberal Democrat members who will decide the contest.

Calls made for prosecution in light of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 report
Garuda pilots face jail if found guilty Updated Indonesian police say they are gathering evidence to pursue manslaughter charges against the two pilots who survived the crash of a Garuda plane earlier this year. Five Australians were among the 21 people killed when Garuda flight 200 crash-landed in March. The pilots, if found guilty, could face up to five years in jail. A spokesman for Indonesia's National Police, Sisno Adiwinoto, has said that two out of five requirements must be met before Garuda flight 200's pilots, Marwoto Komar and Gagam Rachman, can be named as suspects in negligently causing the deaths. Witness testimony, expert witness testimony, suspect testimony, documents and physical evidence or clues can all be drawn on to build a criminal case against the pilots, but only two of these are required to name the pilots as suspects. A damning report by Indonesia's National Transport Safety Committee or NTSC points to pilot errors, and Inspector General Adiwinoto says the case will proceed if enough evidence is found. Downer offers support for Garuda crash charges Updated Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer says the Government will lobby for criminal charges to be brought against those responsible for the Garuda crash which killed five Australians in Indonesia earlier this year. The families of the Australian victims are preparing a class action and Mr Downer says the Government is happy to talk to them about their plans. "You're dealing with the Indonesian system here, it's a different system from our own, so it's not necessarily going to be very easy," he said. "But I think our first priority is to make sure that those who are responsible for this accident, who survived the accident, be brought to justice, that's my priority."

Bush says missile shield "urgently" needed to counter Iranian threat
President George W. Bush speaks at the National Defense University in Washington October 23, 2007. Bush said on Tuesday a planned missile shield in Europe is vital to protect against an ''emerging Iranian threat'' as he pressed an escalating U.S.-led campaign against Tehran.... REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque WASHINGTON President George W. Bush said on Tuesday a planned missile shield in Europe is vital to protect against an "emerging Iranian threat" as he pressed an escalating U.S.-led campaign against Tehran. Laying out his position in the clearest terms so far, Bush used a policy speech at the National Defense University to hammer home the theme that Iran poses a grave danger because of its simultaneous pursuit of nuclear and missile technologies. Bush's latest verbal salvo followed his stark warning last week that a nuclear-armed Iran could lead to World War Three, a remark that drew criticism from political opponents at home who accuse him of stoking tensions with Tehran. "The need for missile defense in Europe is real, and I believe it's urgent," Bush said. "Iran is pursuing the technology that could be used to produce nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles of increasing range that could deliver them." Bush sought to reassure Russia that it need not fear U.S. plans to locate components of the anti-missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, and said Iran would be the key target of such a shield. Trying to shore up international opposition to Iran, the Bush administration has sharpened its rhetoric in the standoff over Tehran's nuclear program. Bush has said he wants a diplomatic solution, although he has not ruled out military action if all else fails. Russia has said it is not convinced Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons or that it will pose a serious missile threat anytime soon.

REUTERS/Mian Khursheed WASHINGTON The United States had cautioned Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf against declaring emergency rule and urged him on Saturday to stick to his pledge to hold free elections early next year. "President Musharraf needs to stand by his pledges to have free and fair elections in January and step down as chief of army staff before retaking the presidential oath of office," Johndroe added. Musharraf imposed emergency rule on Saturday in a bid to reassert his flagging authority against challenges from Islamist militants, a hostile judiciary and political rivals. "All parties involved should move along the democratic path peacefully and quickly," Johndroe said. Earlier, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, while on a visit to Turkey, said she was "deeply disturbed" by Musharraf's declaration of emergency rule, calling it a step backward for democracy. "The U.S. has made very clear that it does not support extra-constitutional measures as they would take Pakistan away from the path of democracy and civilian rule," Rice told reporters as she was taking off from Turkey. "We will be urging the commitment to hold free and fair elections be kept and we will be urging calm on all parties," she said while en route to Jerusalem. Rice said she had spoken multiple times recently to Pakistan's leaders as had other Bush administration officials and expressed strong U.S. reservations about declaring emergency rule. She said she had not spoken to Musharraf since he made the announcement on Saturday. "I am not going to provide the details of those discussions except to say we made very clear that extra-constitutional means would not be supported by the United States," said Rice.

"Obviously we are going to have to review the situation with aid, in part because we have to see what may be triggered by certain statutes," Ms Rice said. In recent years Gen Musharraf has been a key ally in Washington's war on terror and has received about $10bn in aid since 2001. "Some of the aid that goes to Pakistan is directly related to the counterterrorism mission," Ms Rice said, adding that that complicated the issue.

Italy arrests reputed Mafia boss Lo Piccolo
Sicily's Cosa Nostra yesterday suffered a dizzying blow with the arrest of the mafia don regarded as the successor to Bernardo Provenzano, the "boss of bosses" seized last year. Salvatore Lo Piccolo, 65, was captured when police raided a "godfathers' summit" in the hills above Palermo. His son and two other top mafia bosses were arrested with him. The prosecutor who oversaw the operation warned it could unleash a power struggle within Cosa Nostra. Some organised crime experts pointed to a "baby boss" in his 20s as a likely contender for the top job. Among signs of instability in the world's most fabled crime syndicate was that Lo Piccolo was said by investigators to have been betrayed by his own chief "enforcer". The silver-haired don arrived at the main Palermo police station to scenes of jubilant disorder. As the convoy of police vehicles hurtled towards the entrance, officers wearing face masks gave "V for victory" signs to applause from a crowd outside. An elite squad of police and paramilitary Carabinieri had earlier surrounded a house near the town of Giardinello where the top don was meeting with two other fugitive "godfathers", Andrea Adamo and Gaspare Pulizzi. While the arrests were made, police said, a weeping Alessandro Piccolo cried out: "I love you, dad."

Illegal drug found to be used in the manufacture of toys
(Recasts with Aqua Dots recall) By Karey Wutkowski and Julie Vorman WASHINGTON Nov 7 About 4.2 million Chinese-made Aqua Dots toys were recalled for possibly containing a "date rape" drug, U.S. safety officials said on Wednesday after earlier announcing another batch of toy recalls for unacceptably high levels of lead. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said the Aqua Dots craft toys include a chemical, 1,4 butanediol, on their beads which, if swallowed, can turn toxic and cause unconsciousness, respiratory depression, or seizures. The Aqua Dots toys made Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N) list of top 12 Christmas toys and have been sold at major U.S. retail stores since April for between $17 and $30. Australian officials issued a nation-wide ban on a similar toy after three children were hospitalized. Also on Wednesday, the CPSC issued recalls for about 403,000 toys with paint containing excessive levels of lead, including 380,000 toy cars sold at Dollar General stores. Other warnings were for Dizzy Ducks music boxes, Winnie-the-Pooh spinning tops, "Big Red" wagons, Dragster and Funny Car toys, and Duck Family collectible wind-up toys, all because of paint with unsafe levels of lead. Lead is toxic and can pose serious health risks to children, including brain damage. No injuries were reported in Wednesday's lead-related recalls but a CPSC spokesman said the agency had two reports of American children who swallowed the Aqua Dots beads and became unconscious. It urged consumers to take away the Aqua Dots toys from their children and look for any stray beads that may have fallen out of the craft kits. The toy is distributed in North America by Spin Master, Ltd a Toronto company, which said it had recalled Aqua Dots from Canadian retail stores as well. Australia announced a nationwide ban on about 1 million of the toys after investigations showed they contained 1,4 butanediol, which when swallowed metabolizes into a date-rape drug.

French commuters have been hard-hit by the transport strikes Strike action spreads Hundreds of thousands of civil servants have joined striking transport and energy workers as France is paralysed by a second week of industrial action. Teachers, postal workers, air traffic controllers and hospital staff are holding a 24-hour stoppage over planned job cuts and higher wage demands. Many thousands joined street protests in Paris, Rouen, Strasbourg, Marseille, Grenoble, Lyon and other cities. It could end up as the biggest show of defiance at President Nicolas Sarkozy's reform plans since his election in May. The latest nationwide stoppage left many schools closed, hospitals providing a reduced service and newsagents without newspapers. Sarkozy's silence The French capital's two airports and Marseille airport in the south suffered delays and cancellations. I think they have the right to go on strike Paris commuter Strike fever hits France France's workplace anger Are you affected? Half of the country's high-speed TGV trains were operating on Tuesday, while in Paris only one metro train in three was in service and less than half of buses were expected to run. State rail operator SNCF, which is due to hold talks with transport unions on Wednesday, says the number of its workers on strike had fallen since last week. STRIKERS' GRIEVANCES Teachers, civil servants oppose job cuts and want more pay Newspaper distributors angry at planned restructuring Transport workers on strike for a week over pension reforms Students protest at changes they say could exclude poor In pictures: Strikes spread But with traffic gridlock on the capital's roads on Tuesday morning, the stoppage still caused havoc for commuters.

Sabotage strikes French railways
Cables were blackened by apparent acts of arson on the railway It said acts of sabotage overnight, including fires, caused huge delays to TGV services already hit by a transport union strike in its eighth day. President Nicolas Sarkozy said culprits would be severely punished. Union leaders also condemned the attacks. The sabotage came as three-way talks opened in a bid to end the strike. Managers from SNCF and the Paris metro operator RATP were meeting unions and government representatives to try to reach a compromise on reforms to transport workers' pensions. The government has vowed not to back down on its core proposals. Fires In a statement, the SNCF said there had been "several acts" occurring "at the same time" on lines running north, west, east and south-east out of Paris. They are all a bunch of lazy people, and I am personally both enraged and ashamed at their behaviour! Sophie Pradere Paris resident French strikes: Your reaction In pictures: Train 'sabotage' Sarkozy: 'Thatcher moment'? It said these included a "very large" fire on the TGV's Atlantic branch that damaged signals affecting 30km (18 miles) of track. At a cabinet meeting, President Sarkozy ordered the justice and interior ministers to investigate, vowing to punish the perpetrators "with the utmost severity", Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau told France 2 TV. 'No budging' The TGV network was targeted several hours after French Labour Minister Xavier Bertrand said he hoped that conciliation talks would help end the strike.

Middle East peace conference begins in Annapolis, Maryland
“We meet to lay the foundation for the establishment of a new nation: a democratic Palestinian state that will live side by side with Israel in peace and security,” Mr. Bush told the gathering of officials from 49 countries at the United States Naval Academy. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Flanked by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, Mr. Bush cast peace between Israelis and Palestinians as part of a broader struggle against extremism in the Middle East. It was a moment of diplomatic theater, endorsed by the attendance of a member of the Saudi royal family and orchestrated by Mr. Bush, who pledged that the United States would “monitor and judge the fulfillment of the commitment of both sides.” The agreement, cast as a “joint understanding” between the Israelis and the Palestinians, fell short of the detailed five-page document that Palestinian officials have been pushing. But it went somewhat further than the Israelis had wanted, calling for an immediate start to wide-ranging talks aimed at reaching a final peace accord within 13 months. “We agree to immediately launch good-faith bilateral negotiations in order to conclude a peace treaty, resolving all outstanding issues, including all core issues without exception, as specified in previous agreements,” the joint understanding said. “We agree to engage in vigorous, ongoing and continuous negotiations, and shall make every effort to conclude an agreement before the end of 2008.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was not clear until Mr. Bush, Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas stepped onto the podium in the ornate frescoed Memorial Hall at the Naval Academy, near a replica battle flag from the War of 1812 declaring “Don’t Give Up the Ship,” whether the Israelis and the Palestinians had agreed on anything at all. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Even this morning, Mr. Bush held last-minute talks with Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas, while outside the room, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice buttonholed her Israeli and Palestinian counterparts, Tzipi Livni and Abu Alaa, to wring agreement on the wording of the accord. In making the announcement, Mr. Bush read aloud the joint understanding wearing his glasses, suggesting there had not been enough time to convert the just-agreed document to large type for his speech. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Abbas shook hands with Mr. Olmert and Mr. Bush and then pointedly and emotionally put all of the most divisive issues squarely at the center of the talks that are scheduled to begin on Dec. 12. “I am not making an overstatement, Mr. President, if I say that our region stands at a crossroad that separates two historical phases: pre-Annapolis phase and post-Annapolis phase,” Mr. Abbas said. We are prepared to make a painful compromise, rife with risks, in order to realize these aspirations,” he said.

Second night of rioting in Paris suburb, Villiers-le-Bel
Rioting youths blamed the French police for the teenagers' deaths Youths target police The police say some officers suffered bullet wounds, while others were hurt by stones, fireworks and petrol bombs thrown at them in Villiers-le-Bel. The youths said they were avenging the two teenagers killed when their motorcycle hit a police car on Sunday. A senior union official said the riots had been more intense than in 2005. The 2005 unrest, sparked by the accidental deaths of two youths, spread from a nearby suburb of Paris to other cities and continued for three weeks, during which more than 10,000 cars were set ablaze and 300 buildings firebombed. 'Fired upon' The second consecutive night of rioting began early in the evening in Villiers-le-Bel, the northern suburb that saw most of the violence on Sunday. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to keep at bay gangs of youths who were attacking them with stones, fireworks and petrol bombs. Our colleagues will not allow themselves to be fired upon indefinitely without responding Patrice Ribeiro Secretary, Synergie police union Paris riots replayed Have your say More than 70 vehicles and buildings, including the municipal library, two schools and several shops, were set on fire. The national secretary of the Synergie police union, Patrice Ribeiro, said at least 77 officers had been injured in the violence and that several had been wounded by shotgun pellets fired at them. The French Interior Minister, Michele Alliot-Marie, said six police officers had been injured seriously and that they included those who had been "struck in the face and close to the eyes". Mr Ribeiro said police were facing a situation that was "far worse than that of 2005", which began in the nearby suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois. "Our colleagues will not allow themselves to be fired upon indefinitely without responding," he told the radio station, RTL. On Sunday, about 30 cars and several buildings, including a police station, were torched in Villiers-le-Bel and neighbouring Arnouville.

Statement of "joint understanding" released after Annapolis Conference
U.S. President George W. Bush (C) stands on stage with Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert (L) and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the Israel-Palestinian Peace Conference at the U.S. Bush has set himself the Herculean... REUTERS/Jim Young ANNAPOLIS, Maryland U.S. President George W. Bush has set himself the Herculean task of shepherding an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal by the end of next year, but doubts remain about his commitment. As Bush proudly beamed behind them, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas shook hands on Tuesday over an agreement to immediately begin their first formal peace negotiations in seven years. Their goal is to craft a peace treaty by the end of 2008 -- just before the U.S. president leaves office -- but analysts remain skeptical the two politically weakened leaders can cut a deal and that Bush will seriously push them to do so. The question is whether they have the will and the skill," Aaron David Miller, a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center think tank in Washington and a former U.S. peace mediator, said of the Bush administration. "I am not persuaded yet that they have grasped the seriousness and the amount of work that is required to do what they say they want to do -- to reach an agreement on the core issues by the end of the Bush administration," he added. Talks on those issues -- borders, settlements, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees -- are to begin December 12 and any agreement would require compromises that will be painful for both sides. Analysts question whether Olmert, who is unpopular among Israeli voters in part because of corruption investigations, and Abbas, who lost control of the Gaza Strip to the Islamist Hamas group in June, can deliver on any deal they might make. "Neither has the support at home or the control of his government to do something extremely serious," said Jon Alterman of the CSIS think tank in Washington. In part, skepticism about Bush's commitment is born of what critics consider his relative neglect of the issue for the first six years of his presidency. "There is, I think, considerable doubt remaining about whether the administration is prepared to take on the heavy lifting ... to make this work," said Bruce Riedel, an analyst at the Brookings Institution. In his speech at Annapolis, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal raised some doubt about U.S. determination, noting Washington had committed to try to settle the conflict "within a specific time frame and we shall hold them to that." However, Daniel Levy of the New America Foundation think tank said he saw some reasons for "very, very guarded optimism," including the fact that Bush demonstrated his interest in the issue simply by hosting the 44-nation meeting in Annapolis.

Sudanese protesters demand death for British teacher
KHARTOUM, Sudan -- Two British parliament members met officials in Sudan Saturday to try to secure the release of a British teacher imprisoned for naming a teddy bear Muhammad and later said the Khartoum government wants to resolve the case. Britain's Channel 4 News quoted the teacher, Gillian Gibbons, as saying in a statement from police custody that she was being treated well. I'm well," Channel 4 quoted Gibbons as saying. "I want people to know I've been well treated, and especially that I'm well fed. I've been given so many apples I feel I could set up my own stall. I'm really sad to leave, and if I could go back to work tomorrow then I would." Fiona Long, a Channel 4 News spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that the program stood by the accuracy of its report. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi and Lord Nazir Ahmed, both Muslim members of Parliament's upper house, had earlier visited Gibbons in prison for more than an hour. "Gillian was surprisingly in good spirits considering the last seven days," Warsi, a Conservative, told Sky News.

Chinese officials say man dies of H5N1 Avian Flu virus
Special report: Global fight against bird flu  NANJING, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- A man in east China's Jiangsu Province died of bird flu on Sunday, the provincial health department reported. The 24-year-old, surnamed Lu, developed fever, chills and other symptoms on Nov. 24. He was hospitalized on Nov. 27 after being diagnosed with "lower left lobe pneumonia" and his condition further deteriorated. He was the 17th Chinese to die of avian flu since 2003. A respiratory tract sample from the man that was examined by Jiangsu Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Center on Saturday was H5N1 positive. The term referred to the virus's genetic make-up. Before he developed symptoms, Lu had been staying at home preparing for an exam and eating home-cooked food, according to local sources. He also had no contact with infected or deceased fowl, the health department said. A test conducted by the China Disease Control and Prevention Center on Sunday, however, indicated he was H5N1 positive. In line with the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of avian flu infection as well as the Chinese standard, a bird flu prevention and control expert panel of the Chinese Ministry of Health concluded Lu had been infected with the flu. All 69 people who had close contact with Lu have been put under strict medical observation.

Nine who admitted raping 10-year-old released by Australian judge
Sexual abuse has been a noted problem in indigenous communities A judge's decision not to jail nine men guilty of raping a 10-year-old girl in an Aboriginal community has triggered outrage in Australia. The offenders were either placed on probation or given suspended sentences for the 2005 rape in the Aurukun settlement, in northern Queensland. In her ruling, Judge Sarah Bradley told them that the victim "probably agreed to have sex with all of you". A review of sexual abuse sentences in Aboriginal Queensland has been ordered. Sentencing seven of the accused in Cairns in October, Judge Bradley told them that the girl involved was not forced into sex, according to a report in The Australian newspaper. She placed six of the offenders, who were minors at the time of the rape, on probation for 12 months, local media said. 'No excuse' But Australia's newly-elected Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has spoken out against the ruling, saying he was "appalled" by the verdict after it was revealed in the Australian press on Monday. My attitude is one of zero tolerance," he told reporters in Queensland, his home state. I am not prepared to just write this off as an unusual one-off case Anna Bligh Queensland Premier Boni Robertson, an Aboriginal activist in Queensland, said there could be no excuse for the judge's decision. "There is nothing culturally, there is nothing morally, there is nothing socially and there is definitely nothing legally that would ever allow this sort of decision to be made," she said. "I am not prepared to just write this off as an unusual one-off case," she said.

Musharraf lifts emergency rule in Pakistan
Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif waves to his supporters during an election rally in Patoki near Lahore December 16, 2007. REUTERS/Zulfikar Balti BRUSSELS The European Commission welcomed on Monday the lifting of emergency rule in Pakistan but called for all restrictions to be removed ahead of elections. The move by President Pervez Musharraf on Saturday meant it would be possible to send a limited European Union mission of about 50 people to observe the January 8 general election, a spokesman for the EU executive said. "We welcome President Musharraf's lifting of state of emergency and the revoking of the provisional constitutional order," Amadeu Altafaj Tardio told a regular briefing. "It is essential for all restrictions on fundamental rights and freedoms to be lifted in advance of the parliamentary elections," he said. "We thus appeal to the government to take further steps to enhance confidence in the political process." Altafaj underlined it needed to allow a level playing field for all political parties and to ensure complete transparency in the election process. EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner now believed it would be possible to send an election mission to Pakistan, but some points needed to be clarified, he said. Musharraf, a key ally of the West in the battle against Islamist militancy, restored the constitution after more than a month of emergency rule in which he sacked senior judges, locked up lawyers and rounded up thousands of activists. When Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf declared emergency rule six weeks ago, it was a decision fraught with peril – the opposition was threatening mass protests, and he seemed in imminent danger of being overthrown.

Belgian Chamber of Representatives backs interim government
Mr Verhofstadt's team has a backlog of important business Belgium's caretaker Prime Minister, Guy Verhofstadt, won a vote of confidence on Sunday by 97 votes to 46. King Albert appointed him last Thursday for a three-month term. Coalition talks had failed to reconcile party leaders. Belgium's Dutch-speaking Flemish majority and the French-speaking Walloons remain deeply divided over questions of regional autonomy. Mr Verhofstadt, a Dutch-speaking Liberal, has pledged to spend the next three months drafting a new budget, tackling rising prices and preparing reforms to devolve more power to the regions. In March his five-party cabinet will hand power to Yves Leterme's Flemish Christian Democrats - the winners of the 10 June elections. Mr Leterme remains determined to fulfil his election pledge to devolve more power to the regions. Walloon politicians especially dislike Flemish plans to loosen federal control over taxation and social security. Mr Leterme is deputy prime minister and minister for the budget, transport and institutional reform in the 14-member interim government, which includes politicians from the French-speaking community. Mr Verhofstadt's cabinet will remain in office until March The five-party cabinet of caretaker Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt will stay in office for three months. Belgium had been without a full cabinet since the polls, but rival parties from the Dutch- and French-speaking regions finally struck a deal early this week. The main political dispute is over greater regional autonomy - a move broadly favoured by the Dutch-speaking Flanders region but opposed by the French-speaking south. His government will stay in office until March to tackle urgent economic issues neglected during the political crisis.

Benazir Bhutto killed in suicide attack
The blast happened by an entrance to a park A PPP spokesman has told the BBC that Ms Bhutto was injured. It is not clear how badly. She had just addressed the rally in the town of Rawalpindi. In October some 130 people were killed in an attack on Ms Bhutto's cavalcade when she returned to the country. It was one of the worst incidents of violence in a year of deteriorating security in Pakistan. Benazir Bhutto on the campaign trail PPP spokesman Farahtullah Babar said Ms Bhutto was only some 50 metres away when the bomb exploded, the Associated Press news agency reports. "She had just crossed the gate when we heard a deafening sound." Mr Babar said that Ms Bhutto was safe, but subsequently PPP party members have said that Ms Bhutto was injured in the blast and taken to hospital. Ms Bhutto returned from self-imposed exile in October after years out of Pakistan where she had faced corruption charges. Her return was the result of a power-sharing agreement with President Musharraf in which he granted an amnesty that covered the court cases she was facing. On the day of her return she led a motor cavalcade through the city of Karachi.

Violent clashes in Kenya kill scores
Government forces are cracking down on protesters in the wake of Thursday's controversial vote. The thousand-odd protesters carried leafy branches – a standard totem of protest in Kenya – and returned to the slum of Kibera after being turned back, peacefully, by police. It is a calm exception to the looting, shooting, and tear gas that have followed Kenya's most closely contested presidential election. It is also a sign that opposition discontent – peaceful or otherwise – over the announced victory of incumbent President Mwai Kibaki shows no sign of stopping. "The international community knows exactly what has happened: Mr. Kibaki lost the election," says opposition presidential candidate Raila Odinga at a Monday press conference. It is important that this crisis be resolved peacefully, and we have urged our supporters around the country ... to resist acts of violence." If the Dec. 27 elections were a test of Kenyan democracy, as analysts said they would be, the past few days show Kenya heading for a failing grade. Charges of rigging from both major parties, violent protests, and a spiral of ethnic violence – some of it prompted by racist cellphone text messages – have killed more than 120 Kenyans around the country. "From an outside perspective, it looks like [this election] happened too fast," says Bradley Austin, an election expert at the International Foundation for Election Systems.

Study suggests hospitals are not the best place for cardiac arrest treatment
If your heart were to stop suddenly, you'd think a hospital would be the safest place to be. An alarming new study, released today in the New England Journal of Medicine, says that in about a third of cardiac arrest cases nationwide, hospital staffs do not respond quickly enough, which increases the risk of brain damage and death, and may contribute to the deaths of thousands of Americans every year. Watch the full report tonight on "World News with Charles Gibson" at 6:30 p.m. ET Click here to ask one of the authors of this new study a question about hospital heart care. On television a "code blue" is called, and doctors and nurses come running with a defibrillator to shock the heart back to life. But in actuality, hospital staffs often don't move that fast, and the consequences can be chilling. If you get prompt defibrillation within two minutes of cardiac arrest, your changes of surviving are nearly 40 percent. But delay defibrillation — even by a few minutes — and your chances tumble to 22.2 percent. Today's study, which looked at 6,789 cardiac arrest cases at 369 hospitals, showed that hospital staffs took longer than two minutes nearly one-third of the time. Now compare those statistics to the more than 50 percent of patients who survive heart attacks while in a crowded airport or a casino, where defibrillators are readily available. Delays in hospitals were most common at night and on weekends. Patients in smaller hospitals with fewer than 250 beds, and in units without heart monitors, are in especially grave danger.

Israeli troops kill 9 in Gaza
Israel is upset with Cairo for allowing more than 2,000 Gazans to return home from the hajj pilgrimage through the Rafah border crossing with Gaza, rather than, as originally agreed, through the Kerem Shalom crossing controlled by Israel. Israel wanted to check the returning pilgrims to see if they were smuggling cash back for Hamas, which runs Gaza, or if some of those returning were wanted militants who had received military training in Lebanon, Syria or Iran.

But if Hamas is allowed through a porous border to strengthen itself, build a more formidable military regime and expand the range of its rockets, it’s not in Egypt’s interests, either.” Israel continued its attacks on Palestinian militants in Gaza, especially from Islamic Jihad.

Pentagon releases video of incident involving Iranian ships in Persian Gulf
Iran says US video was fabricated The US says Iranian boats were being provocative and dangerous The confrontation Iran's Revolutionary Guards say the US navy fabricated evidence that a convoy of its ships was harassed by Iranian speedboats in Gulf waters on Sunday. The US has released grainy footage, apparently showing small boats speeding near the American warships. In an audio recording, an Iranian radio operator appears to say "I am coming at you; you will explode". The Iranian parliamentary speaker has dismissed the affair as being part of a US propaganda campaign against Tehran. "The footage released by the US Navy are file pictures and the audio has been fabricated," Iranian state-run TV quoted a Revolutionary Guards source as saying. The US Pentagon says the American ships were about to open fire when the Iranian boats withdrew. US President George W Bush described the incident as "provocative", adding that it was a "dangerous situation" that should not have happened. Warning You will explode Voice on US tape Radio communications The video, said to be shot from the bridge of the USS Hopper in the Strait of Hormuz, appears to show the small boats racing near the wake of the US ships and crossing close to each other. One boat is shown in close-up - a blue speedboat with at least two crew. After spotting the approaching vessels, a Navy crewman can be heard over the radio, warning them they are approaching a coalition warship. "Request you establish communications, identify yourself and state your intentions, over," he says. At the end of the US recording, the screen goes black and the remainder is in audio only.

'Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography' released, $100 million lawsuit in planning stages
The controversial author of a new biography of Tom Cruise is defending his claim that the actor is the de facto “second in command” of the Church of Scientology and says a lengthy church statement rebutting the book supports the charge. Labeled a writer of “outlandish and malicious lies” by Cruise’s publicist, Andrew Morton told TODAY co-host Meredith Vieira in an exclusive interview that he knew that there would be a backlash when he set out to explore the deep ties between Cruise and the church founded by the late science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. “I think this is a fair, evenhanded treatment of Tom Cruise’s life,” said Morton, who’s also written biographies of Princess Diana, Monica Lewinsky and Madonna. “He’s a man who deserves attention.” “Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography” was released in the U.S. Tuesday after publishers in the United Kingdom and elsewhere reportedly passed on it due to concerns about lawsuits. The release was greeted by a 15-page rebuttal issued by the Church of Scientology, of which Cruise is a member, which calls attention to Morton’s background as a British tabloid journalist and states: “His book is a bigoted, defamatory assault replete with lies.” The church took particular exception to Morton’s claim that Cruise, who has been named the most powerful celebrity in the world by Forbes magazine, is effectively the second-in-command of the controversial religion. “Insinuations that Mr. Cruise is second-in-command of the Church are not only false, they are ludicrous,” the church’s statement says. Mr. Cruise is a Scientology parishioner and holds no official or unofficial position in the church hierarchy.” “It’s nonsense for them to say that, because he’s one of the most significant members of the church,” Morton told Vieira. This book is very carefully researched, very carefully vetted.” When Vieira asked who told him that Cruise is effectively second-in-command, Morton said, “People who worked with David Miscavige, the head of the Church of Scientology, people who’ve just left, people who’ve been in executive positions.” Further, he said, it’s unusual for a church to issue a lengthy rebuttal of a book for an ordinary member. Countering Morton’s assertions of accuracy, the church pointed out that the book is not being published in Australia, England and New Zealand because of those countries’ strict libel laws. And in its review, The New York Times wrote that Morton “pushed the limits of responsible reporting.” “Their policy is always to attack the attacker,” Morton said of Scientology, which in his book he calls a cult.

Tom Cruise Scientology promotional video leaked to the Internet
'It's rough and tumble, wild and woolly" and "a blast," according to Tom Cruise. But Scientology also confers some serious bling, none shinier than the Freedom Medal of Valour. The actor and proselytiser for the Church of Scientology was awarded this gold-coloured medallion by the movement in 2004 but an edited video clip of Cruise giving an intense spiel for the award ceremony has only just emerged on YouTube. The gong features two interlocking triangles on their sides with an "S" snaking through and the words "freedom medal" around the top. According to Andrew Morton's new unauthorised biography of Cruise, the actor is the second most powerful person in the organisation. In a statement condemning Morton's book, the Scientologists described him rather more dismissively as "a Scientology parishioner" who "holds no official or unofficial position in the Church hierarchy". He is, however, the only holder of the Freedom Medal of Valour. Cruise's is the same, says Janet Laveau, of the Church of Scientology in Britain, but "the Medal of Valour means the humanitarian work he did reached a larger global population". "It's about rolling up your own personal sleeves and making a very big difference for people who need help," she says. So, Cruise gets some bling, but Scientology gets something far more valuable: an A-list Hollywood actor, ever ready to extol the virtues of his movement. The Internet is buzzing with a video that shows a behind-the-scenes interview of Tom Cruise discussing The Church of Scientology.But the inside look has left many people wondering about the religion.The video can be found on Gawker and YouTube, and is the center of a legal battle between Scientology and Gawker.The video is a "Tom-Cruise-in-his-own-words"-type presentation that was played at a Scientology awards dinner as a preamble to Cruise winning an award several years ago.Mark Oppenheimer, who's researched and written about Scientology for The New York Times and other publications, analyzed the video onThursday.Oppenheimer, author of "Knocking on Heaven's Door: American Religion in the Age of Counterculture," clarified what Cruise was saying, and what he meant by many of the terms he used.

Fred Thompson quits U.S. Presidential race
(CNN) -- Former Sen. Fred Thompson on Tuesday ended his run for the presidency, coming off the heels of a disappointing third-place finish in South Carolina's GOP primary and heading into the showdown state of Florida next week. Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee has dropped out of the race for the GOP presidential nomination. "Today I have withdrawn my candidacy for president of the United States," Thompson said in a statement. "I hope that my country and my party have benefited from our having made this effort. Jeri and I will always be grateful for the encouragement and friendship of so many wonderful people." Thompson entered the race in September, long after his Republican rivals had announced their candidacies and began raising money. His campaigning style was criticized as lackluster, and he was never able to capitalize on the anticipation supporters had built before he announced that he was getting into the race. Short of cash and sinking in national polls, Thompson had staked his hopes on South Carolina, where a strong showing could have reinvigorated his flagging campaign. Watch how Thompson's withdrawal could affect the race » Thompson played to the voters as a staunch conservative and a son of the South. Sen. John McCain won Saturday's contest with 33 percent, followed by Huckabee with 30 percent. "He's really been good lately, but it's too late," CNN analyst Bill Bennett said of Thompson after South Carolina returns started to come in.

Italy's PM Prodi faces confidence vote
(Adds 1st vote, opposition, analysis and quotes)  By Stephen Brown  ROME, Jan 23 Italy's centre-left government struggled to stay afloat on Wednesday and even the president appeared to doubt that Prime Minister Romano Prodi, weakened by defections, could survive a confidence vote in the Senate. As expected, Prodi won a first confidence vote in the lower house where he has a clear majority. But with Prodi under pressure to step down before the vote in the upper house due on Thursday, the third biggest economy in the euro zone seemed doomed to prolonged political upheaval that will further delay reforms, just when a global slowdown looms. Ordinary Italians, who have seen 61 governments since World War Two, seemed jaded by the prospect of more turmoil, while in worried markets, the spread between Italian government bonds and German bunds widened to levels not seen for 6-1/2 years. A government source said President Giorgio Napolitano had advised Prodi to "review" the wisdom of facing the Senate, where he has lost his majority. "After today it's 100 percent certain Romano Prodi will resign to avoid being beaten in the Senate," said right-wing National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini. Prodi's once slim Senate majority has been erased by the defection of former justice minister Clemente Mastella's Catholic Udeur and the centrist Liberal Democrats. Losing or drawing the vote would force Prodi to quit but the 68-year-old prime minister fuelled speculation he might resign earlier by visiting Napolitano -- a reminder of his tactical resignation last February meant to scare his allies into line. "MINORITY DICTATORSHIP"  Prodi's fate hangs on whether he can muster enough support in the Senate to compensate for the defections and for two coalition dissidents who have said they will vote 'no'. Without his two-seat Senate majority, he relies entirely on seven unelected lifetime senators to survive. Giulio Andreotti, an ex-prime minister and honorary senator, said he saw "no alternative at the moment to this government, so I will vote for Prodi". But Roberto Maroni, a deputy from the right-wing Northern League, said it would be a "minority dictatorship" if Prodi clung to power on the votes of unelected elder statesmen.

REUTERS/Enrico Oliverio/Italian Presidency Press Office/Handout ROME Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi resigned on Thursday after his centre-left government lost a confidence vote in the Senate, prompting opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi to demand immediate elections. We will say what we want to do in the first 100 days of our government," said conservative former prime minister Berlusconi, who has led Prodi in opinion polls. But President Giorgio Napolitano may first appoint an interim government to reform a messy electoral system, which in 2006 landed Prodi with a tiny Senate majority and an unstable nine-party coalition ranging from Catholics to communists. Analysts said the demise of the 61st government since World War Two should not hurt economic growth prospects, as Prodi had been too busy surviving politically to carry out deep reforms, but could threaten a recent improvement in public finances. Many Italians hope for electoral reform to cure chronic instability, illustrated by the fact that Prodi's 20-month spell in power was the seventh longest government in post-war Italy. "This isn't necessarily bad news, it all depends what comes after Prodi," said Unicredit MIB economist Marco Valli. "Markets don't like uncertainty but if what follows Prodi is a stronger government, then that could be positive." Berlusconi's senators opened champagne to celebrate, earning a rebuke from Senate President Franco Marini who said: "Get rid of that bottle, we're not in a pub here." Prodi, 68, was undermined by his own allies, just as when his first spell in office was cut short in 1998. This time a small Catholic party's defection erased his tiny majority in the Senate and made a vote of no confidence almost inevitable.

Indonesia reports 100th human death from bird flu
Jan 29 The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed on Tuesday the deaths of a 23-year-old Indonesian woman and a nine-year-old Indonesian boy from the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. Of the 124 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 100 have been fatal. There have been 223 human deaths globally from the H5N1 strain and 357 confirmed cases of infection since 2003, according to WHO data. Following is a list of confirmed human cases of H5N1. Deaths Total cases AZERBAIJAN 5 8 CAMBODIA 7 7 CHINA 17 27 DJIBOUTI 0 1 EGYPT 19 43 INDONESIA 100 124 IRAQ 2 3 LAOS 2 2 MYANMAR 0 1 NIGERIA 1 1 PAKISTAN 1 1 THAILAND 17 25 TURKEY 4 12 VIETNAM 48 102 ------------------------------------------------- TOTAL 223 357 -------------------------------------------------  The H5N1 virus remains mainly a virus of birds, but experts fear it could change into a form easily transmitted from person to person and sweep the world, killing millions. So far, most human cases can be traced to direct or indirect contact with infected birds. Initial tests usually take a day or two to confirm if someone has H5N1. More detailed testing by government laboratories or those affiliated with the WHO can take a week or more. JAKARTA, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of bird flu casualties in Indonesia has reached 100, following the death of two more patients over the last few days, according to local media on Tuesday. A 9-year-old boy died at a Jakarta hospital on Sunday and was tested positive of having the H5N1 virus, and on the same day a 23-year-old woman from the Jakarta suburb of Bekasi became the 100th victim, Metro TV news reported. In overall, Indonesia has confirmed 124 bird flu cases in human since the virus began ravaging in 2003. Indonesia is the nation worst affected by bird flu and has struggled to contain the virus.

International manhunt for alleged kidney harvester
Indian police have confiscated the passports of two Britons who allegedly travelled to the country to buy kidneys in an organ transplant racket, investigators said today. After raiding a private hospital last week in Gurgaon, an upmarket suburb of Delhi, police found that poor labourers had had their kidneys removed, sometimes against their will, and sold to clients from around the world. Doctors running the illegal operation charged 1.5m rupees (£18,750) for a kidney transplant while the donor was paid about 40,000 rupees. The trade has shocked India, which banned the sale of kidneys for commercial gain in 1994 with jail terms of up to five years for those found guilty. However, the ring is believed to have seen more than 500 organs bought in the past nine years. The police seized computers and are decoding e-mail accounts. Five labourers, three of whom had lost kidneys, were also rescued. Police told the Guardian today that "two British people have not been let out of the country" as part of their investigation". They are helping with our investigation... [There] are allegations that they are part [of the buying ring]," said the deputy commissioner of Gurgaon police, Rakesh Arya. They have been apprehended but not yet charged." The police refused to divulge their names and the British High Commission said it had not been informed of an investigation.

ATHENS, Greece — The leader of Greece’s powerful Orthodox Church, Archbishop Christodoulos, who eased centuries of tension with the Vatican but was viewed as reactionary by his liberal critics, died Monday. Christodoulos, who headed the church for a decade, was first hospitalized in Athens in June before being diagnosed with cancer of the liver and large intestine. He spent 10 weeks in a hospital in Miami but an October liver transplant operation was canceled when doctors discovered the cancer had spread. He refused hospital treatment in the final weeks of his life. He died at his home in the Athens suburb of Psyhico, church officials said. The Interior Ministry announced four days of national mourning and said Christodoulos would be buried on Thursday with full state honors. The archbishop’s flag-draped coffin was taken to the cathedral in Athens, where his body will lie in state until his funeral. Christodoulos was elected church leader in 1998 and is credited with reinvigorating the vast institution that represents 97 percent of Greece’s native born population. Christodoulos helped create church Web sites and radio stations, and frequently issued detailed checklists on how black-clad Orthodox priests should conduct themselves in public. In 2001, Christodoulos received the late John Paul II — the first pope to visit Greece in nearly 1,300 years.

High level al-Qaeda leader reported dead
Libi is thought to have directed recent suicide attacks News of his death emerged on a website used by Islamist groups. Ekhlaas.org said he had "fallen as a martyr". Pakistan says it cannot confirm reports that Libi was killed by a US missile strike in Pakistan on Tuesday Libi is believed to have behind an attack at an Afghan air base last year while the US vice-president was there. Most analysts say Libi's death would be a blow to al-Qaeda, both symbolically and operationally. But the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says al-Qaeda has proved itself to be resilient to individual losses and setbacks, and no-one is predicting an immediate decline in attacks in the region. US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he did not "have anything definitive" to say about the news, the Associated Press reported. Al-Qaeda spokesman Libi, 41, has appeared in a number of al-Qaeda videos. ABU LAITH AL-LIBI Born: Libya, around 1967 Description: 193cm (6'4") tall, solid build, dark hair and eyes, scars on back Role: Senior operations commander; al-Qaeda spokesman Source: Globalsecurity.org  Profile: Abu Laith al-Libi He has acted as a spokesman for the group, announcing in 2002 that Osama Bin Laden and Taleban leader Mullah Omar had survived the US invasion of Afghanistan. Libi was under US intelligence surveillance and most details about him are classified, our correspondent says. "This individual is in the top half-dozen figures in al-Qaeda... who has a long record of military activity on behalf of al-Qaeda," an unnamed Western official told Reuters news agency. He is thought to be one of al-Qaeda's most senior field commanders in Afghanistan, and to have directed a number of recent suicide bomb attacks in the east of the country. The US has linked him the bombing at the US base at Bagram in Afghanistan in February last year that killed 23 people.

75 million left without Internet access after fault in undersea cable
The first cut caused widespread disruption to net services The Falcon cable, owned by a firm which operates another damaged cable, led to a "critical" telecom breakdown, according to one local official. The cause of the latest break has not been confirmed but a repair ship has been deployed, said owner Flag Telecom. The earlier break disrupted service in Egypt, the Middle East and India. "The situation is critical for us in terms of congestion," Omar Sultan, chief executive of Dubai's ISP DU, told The Associated Press, following the most recent break. Wednesday's incident caused disruption to 70% of the nationwide internet network in Egypt on Wednesday, while India suffered up to 60% disruption. Flag Telecom said a repair ship was expected to arrive at the site of the first break - 8.3km from Alexandria in Egypt - on 5 February, with repair work expected to take a week. A repair ship deployed to the second break - 56km from Dubai - was expected to arrive at the site in the "next few days", the firm said. Web returns The first cable - the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG) - was cut at 0800 on 30 January, the firm said. INSIDE A SUBMARINE CABLE 1 Polyethylene cover 2,4 Stranded steel armour wires 3,5 Tar-soaked nylon yarn 6 Polycarbonate insulator 7 Copper sheath 8 Protective core 9 Optical fibres Not to scale A second cable thought to lie alongside it - SEA-ME-WE 4, or the South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 cable - was also split. FLAG is a 28,000km (17,400 mile) long submarine communications cable that links Australia and Japan with Europe via India and the Middle East. The two cable cuts meant that the only cable in service connecting Europe to the Middle East via Egypt was the older Sea-M-We 3 system, according to research firm TeleGeography.

US presidential candidates gearing up for Super Tuesday
With 72 hours to go before Super Tuesday, and with some two dozen states at play, the candidates are hop-scotching the country this weekend, trying to scoop up delegates like pebbles. Ensconced in delegate rich California this weekend, Sen. Hillary Clinton seems to be sending a message to voters torn between her and Sen. Barack Obama, suggesting maybe she'd make him her running mate. "Seeing the two of us was just so exciting for so many people," Clinton told PBS host Tavis Smiley in an interview after the two debated Thursday night. With delegates allotted proportionally, a candidate doesn't have to win the state to walk out closer to the nomination. "This is, frankly, a delegate race at this point," Obama admitted at a campaign rally earlier this week. "The president made a deal with Sen. Kennedy and neither one of them meant to mess it up," the former president said, referring to Kennedy's support for President Bush's No Child Left Behind education plan. Clinton's fellow Arkansan Mike Huckabee is staying south for the Republican race -- trying to prevent his fellow evangelicals from flocking to rival Mitt Romney. "I've got a far more conservative record than Mitt Romney ever dreamed of having," Huckabee said this week. Sen. John McCain is also down south today in Nashville, trying to build on momentum from big endorsements and his Florida win before he heads to Massachusetts, the home state of Mitt Romney. Romney is sinking more of his millions into TV ads in Super Tuesday states, but for the first time he hinted he needs to get a serious return on his investment Tuesday to keep going.

Rugby union: Wales, France, England win in second week of 2008 Six Nations
By Sean Davies Williams' second try was highly controversial Wales (10) 30 Tries: S Williams 2, Hook Cons: Hook 2, S Jones Pens: Hook, S Jones 2 Scotland (6) 15 Pens: Paterson 5 A spectacular brace of Shane Williams tries saw Wales maintain their 100% start to the RBS Six Nations. The home side dominated possession and territory and their flair saw first half tries for Williams and James Hook. But dogged Scotland held on through the boot of Chris Paterson, the wing landing all five of his goal kicks. Leading just 17-15 on 60 minutes, Wales changed their half-backs and regathered before Williams split the defence and squeezed in for a controversial score. Highlights: Wales 30-15 Scotland Interview: Man of the match Martyn Williams Interview: Wales coach Warren Gatland Interview: Scotland coach Frank Hadden Wales began with the momentum of last week's stunning win over England, man-of-the-match Martyn Williams and Hook pouncing on a loose Scotland line-out to win their side a scrum five metres from the visitors' line. 606: DEBATE Martyn Williams remains the scavenger supreme BBC Sport's Bruce Pope Scotland's defence proved stout through a series of Welsh drives, and they escaped with a penalty when Tom Shanklin held the ball on the floor. The Welsh were looking to spread the ball in front of a record crowd at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, but Hook spun a midfield pass into the arms of Andrew Henderson. Paterson hacked forward to the Wales line, securing the position from which the wing - restored to Frank Hadden's team this week after the miserable loss to France - opened the scoring with a 10th-minute penalty. It's 100% certain that I scored, there's no doubt in my mind Shane Williams More Wales reaction The ball was spun left, Hook putting Lee Byrne into space with a delightful pass after Gavin Henson helped straighten the line. Byrne's pass went behind Williams, but the winger gathered and threw a trademark side-step to cross for the opening try, converted by Hook. The 14 men held out, Hook and Paterson exchanging penalties after his return to leave Scotland relieved with a scoreline of 10-6 at the break.

International row after Spielberg quits 2008 Beijing Olympics
'A call for a boycott doesn't serve any purpose and it would be a great pity' Boycotting the Olympics would not help the human rights situation in Darfur, the Olympics minister Tessa Jowell said today. She said that although aspects of Chinese policy were "wholly unacceptable", a boycott was not the right way to exert pressure on Beijing. Jowell was speaking in response to calls from Sudanese rebels for the international community to boycott the Olympics because of China's support for the Sudanese government and its role in Darfur. "The world has known for the last seven years that Beijing would host the Olympics," Jowell told the Times. "Most progressive governments accept that there are wholly unacceptable aspects of Chinese policy, but that did not stop the International Olympic Committee awarding them the games. "A call for a boycott doesn't serve any purpose and it would be a great pity. This doesn't mean, however, we should be distracted from the urgency of Darfur." Mr Spielberg's decision is a high-profile blow to Olympic organisers The foreign ministry said "ulterior motives" may be behind criticism of its links with Sudan. The director said his conscience would not allow him to continue in his role. China has strong economic and military ties with Sudan, which campaigners say it should use to put pressure on Khartoum to resolve the Darfur crisis. "It is understandable if some people do not understand the Chinese government policy on Darfur, but I am afraid that some people may have ulterior motives, and this we cannot accept," he told a news conference.

Six dead in campus shooting at Northern Illinois University
NIU campus gathers to commemorate 1 year since fatal rampage Victims are mourned and community aims to move forward in victims' honor On Saturday, the sophomore returned to the center, joining another crowd to pay tribute to the victims once again. But this time, the mood was different, as the university also celebrated its triumph of recovery. Alyssa Everley was among thousands of students who gathered solemnly at Northern Illinois University's Convocation Center last February for a memorial service honoring five victims slain in a bloody rampage. "Last year it was shock and pain," Everley said. "Now we still want to pay respect to the victims, but we also realize the best way to honor them is by moving forward." Twelve months have passed since a suicidal gunman, Steven Kazmierczak, shot 25 students in an NIU lecture hall, leaving the campus plagued with confusion, anger and sadness. On the first anniversary, the university spent sun-up to sundown honoring the victims, while heralding the compassion and courage demonstrated on the campus. "This is a celebration of character," proclaimed NIU President John Peters, speaking at the morning kick-off ceremony, which honored first responders who arrived on the scene of the shootings, the volunteers who poured onto campus and those who donated cash, quilts and other support to the university. "A year ago, a year ago in this very place, we pledged to not let a single act of violence define us," Peters said. The university used the day of remembrance to unveil plans for a $160,000 memorial garden to be built near Cole Hall, the building where the shootings occurred. Peters led a ceremonial procession to the site that included the families of the victims and Gov.

US military to shoot down errant spy satellite

President George W. Bush decided to have the Navy shoot the 5,000-pound (2,270 kg) minivan-sized satellite with a modified tactical missile, after security advisers suggested its reentry could lead to a loss of life. U.S. officials said they were not trying to protect classified information on the satellite or to demonstrate their capabilities to China, which downed one of its own satellites with a missile last year, drawing criticism from Washington. Two defense officials also cited disagreement within the administration over the action and said the decision appears to have been strongly influenced by the White House. Officials would not estimate the likelihood of success, only calling it high. Thousands of space objects fall to Earth each year, but they generally scatter over a huge area and there have never been any reported injuries. What makes this different is the likelihood that the satellite could release much of the more than 1,000 pounds (454 kg) of hydrazine fuel as a toxic gas, according to James Jeffries, deputy national security adviser. He said the satellite was unlikely to hit a populated area and described the danger from toxic gas as limited. Jeffries and other U.S. officials rejected suggestions that Bush opted to shoot down the satellite out of concern that classified material on board could survive reentry into Earth's atmosphere, and potentially land in the wrong hands.

Kosovo declares independence from Serbia
Albanian and American flags have been on prominent display Declaration Kosovo's parliament has unanimously endorsed a declaration of independence from Serbia, in a historic session. Celebrations went on into the night after Prime Minister Hashim Thaci promised a democracy that respected the rights of all ethnic communities. Serbia's PM denounced the US for helping create a "false state". A split later emerged at the Security Council, when Russia said there was no basis for changing a 1999 resolution which handed Kosovo to the UN. Seven Western countries said it was quite clear the situation had moved on. Tens of thousands of people had thronged the streets of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, since the morning. We have waited for this day for a very long time... from today, we are proud, independent and free Hashim Thaci Kosovo Prime Minister Kosovo's 'dream come true' Mark Mardell's Euroblog Serb and Albanian views Crowds surrounded an independence monument which was unveiled during the evening and signed by Mr Thaci and Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu.

Magnitude 7.5 earthquake strikes Aceh
The tremor, whose epicentre was near the island of Simeulue, 319km (198 miles) off the coast of Sumatra, also damaged many buildings, they added. The epicentre was close to that of the earthquake which triggered the 2004 Asian tsunami, killing 200,000 people. Tsunami warning centres initially issued alerts, but later lifted them. Indonesia lies on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, one of the most seismically active regions of the world. 'Mass panic' Local residents said Wednesday's earthquake, which hit Simeulue at 1508 (0808 GMT) according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), lasted for almost a minute. It was felt strongly more than 300km (185 miles) away in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, where people left their offices after buildings started shaking. Everything shook very strongly for more than a minute and I ran along with the others Ahmad Yushadi "Everything shook very strongly for more than a minute and I ran along with the others. I heard people screaming in panic," Ahmad Yushadi told the Associated Press news agency. An official from the Indonesian ministry of health, Rustam Pakaya, said the authorities on Simeulue had reported three deaths and 25 serious injuries caused by the earthquake.

Belgrade: demonstration against independent Kosovo escalates into riots
A charred body has been discovered inside a torched office at the U.S. Embassy in Serbia's capital Belgrade, embassy officials said Thursday, just hours after several hundred demonstrators attacked the compound. The swarm of rioters had broken away from a massive rally held earlier in the day to protest against Washington's recognition of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The U.S. Embassy in Belgrade burns after masked attackers broke into the building and set an office on fire. ((Associated Press)) Flames and smoke billowed out of an office on the embassy grounds around 7 p.m. local time after crowds of masked young men broke into the compound and used metal bars to smash into the first floor of the building. A few demonstrators climbed the building and set the U.S. flag on fire as others used a door to ram the metal-barred windows. "Our embassy was attacked by thugs," White House press secretary Dana Perino said while travelling from Africa with reporters and U.S. officials on Air Force One. "We have made known to the Serbian government our concern and displeasure that their police force did not prevent this incident." Embassy spokesman William Wenland said all embassy staffers were accounted for, and noted the person who died was likely a protester. "It appeared to have been a protester who was caught in the fire that had been set by the protesters and not as a result of any interaction with U.S. security forces," Wenland said. Dozens of heavily armed police patrolled the area soon after, while riot police used shields and tear gas to push back the mostly male demonstrators, who then fled into side streets and continued to clash with security forces. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S. ambassador to Serbia was staying safe at his home and was in contact with U.S. officials as the clashes were ongoing. Security officials and marine guards were in a different part of the compound, but no embassy staff were inside the attacked building, McCormack told reporters Thursday afternoon in Washington.

Rescuers rappelled from helicopters to search for remains in the shattered wreckage lodged 13,000 feet above sea level on a craggy, rock wall known as "Indian Face." Pieces of white fuselage and other remains from the crash littered the area, images from a video shot by searchers showed. Whipped by cross-winds, rescue mountain-climbers struggled to lower themselves down the cliff to reach the plane operated by the small local airline Santa Barbara, civil defense chief Antonio Rivero said. With few clearings to land choppers, searchers set up camp almost a mile away and trekked across the rugged terrain to the wreckage. The plane crashed 6 miles from the tourist city of Merida after taking off for the capital Caracas on Thursday before dusk in a notoriously difficult region to navigate.

Prince Harry ordered to return home
British media agreed not to report the prince's deployment The 23-year-old royal, who has spent the last 10 weeks serving in Helmand Province, is flying back to the UK amid concerns for his safety. The move follows the collapse of a news blackout deal over his tour of duty, which was broken by foreign media. There had been fears the prince, who is third in line to the throne, could become a target for the Taleban. In a statement, the Ministry of Defence described the reporting of Harry's deployment by foreign media as "regrettable" but said that contingency plans for such a leak were in place. Prince Harry, in an interview recorded in Afghanistan prior to his withdrawal, said he had enjoyed being away from the press and England. "I don't want to sit around Windsor, because I generally don't like England that much and it's nice to be away from all the press and the papers.....," he said. More recently he took part in a major operation to disrupt Taleban lines of communication Brigadier Andrew Mackay It added that while the prince should have returned "in a matter of weeks" with his Household Cavalry regiment battlegroup, the situation had now "clearly changed". Brigadier Andrew Mackay, Commander of Task Force Helmand, said Harry had been "deployed in the field, conducting operations against the Taleban" at the time of the decision. "This decision has been taken primarily on the basis that the worldwide media coverage of Prince Harry in Afghanistan could impact on the security of those who are deployed there, as well as the risks to him as an individual soldier," it added. Prime Minister Gordon Brown paid tribute to the prince and said Britain owed him a "debt of gratitude" for his service in Afghanistan, but he added that it was correct to bring Harry back to the UK.

Mystery surrounds ricin discovery in Las Vegas hotel
LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Officers who found the deadly poison ricin in a Las Vegas, Nevada, extended-stay hotel room also discovered firearms and an "anarchist-type textbook" with an entry about ricin bookmarked, police said Friday. The deadly poison ricin and an "anarchist-type textbook" were found in a room in this Las Vegas hotel. Two tests had confirmed the substance found was ricin, and that a man who was staying there has been hospitalized for more than two weeks and is in critical condition, police said Friday. The 57-year-old man, whose name was not released, summoned authorities February 14 and asked to be transported to a hospital because of difficulty breathing, Kathy Suey, deputy chief of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters. But police were not aware of the ricin's existence until Thursday, when a second man, who identified himself as a relative of the victim, went to the Extended Stay America room to clear the victim's possessions out and found the substance. That man brought the poison, which was in vials in a plastic bag, to the manager's office, and police were notified. "He brought it to the management and said that 'I'm not comfortable with whatever this item is.'" Watch how ricin can be used to kill » Lombardo said police first were called to the room on Tuesday after weapons were discovered there. He said officers discovered "general firearms," which have been impounded, and an "anarchist-type textbook" marked at an entry on ricin.

Armenian President Kocharyan declares state of emergency
(CNN) -- Armenian President Robert Kocharian declared a state of emergency Saturday night after a day of clashes between police and protesters, a spokeswoman for the Armenian Foreign Ministry said. The state of emergency will "hopefully bring some order" to the capital, Yerevan, said Salpi Ghazarian, assistant to the Armenian foreign minister, who spoke to CNN early Sunday. The state of emergency could last until March 20, she said, but the government hopes "that it will be lifted sooner." The clashes began when authorities used force to clear Freedom Square of thousands of demonstrators who had camped there for the past 10 days, according to a U.S. Embassy official. Ghazarian said the authorities "moved in" because "they thought that there were arms there, and it turned out that they were right." Watch a report on clashes between police and the opposition » The embassy official estimated that the demonstrations in Freedom Square grew to as many as 60,000 Armenians at times over the last 10 days. Watch Ghazarian discuss the situation in Armenia » "What is happening on the streets of Yerevan is people protesting what they consider to be unfair elections," Ghazarian said. There are a couple of burning cars, and there are a few hurt people," she said. Witnesses told CNN that Saturday morning's action by Armenian riot police was bloody, but the U.S. official said there were no confirmed deaths or serious injuries.

Small explosion investigated in Times Square, New York
Authorities on Friday were investigating whether an explosion at the Times Square military recruiting office was connected to strikingly similar bombings at two foreign consulates in New York, but ruled out a link to mysterious letters sent to Capitol Hill offices. Investigators were also scrutinizing surveillance video and forensic evidence after a bicycle-riding bomber struck the landmark station Thursday, scarring one of the world's most recognizable locations. Authorities said there was no connection between the blast and a letter sent to as many as 100 members of Congress bearing the words "Happy New Year, We Did It." The lengthy anti-war letters — which arrived with photos of a man standing in front of the recruiting office before it was damaged — contained no threats, officials said. Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles, said an individual was questioned there about the letters to Congress and "there is no evidence linking the letters, which contained no threat, to the bombing." A law enforcement official in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation of the bombing is continuing, called the timing of the letters an "incredibly unbelievable coincidence" and said no charges were expected in connection with them. Democratic lawmakers were startled to receive the letters in their office mail just hours after the early morning New York bombing, and turned them over to the Capitol Police. One law enforcer said the "We did it" referred to the Democratic wins. That process, which involves radiating incoming mail, can easily take a week or more, making it likely the letters were mailed well ahead of the bombing. Law enforcement officials speculated the letters may have been sent to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the start of the Iraq war, which is March 19. And the "We did it" claim may simply be sarcasm connected to the war, one official said.

Protester says Japanese whalers shot him

REUTERS/Sea Shepherd Conservation Society/Handout SYDNEY A hardline anti-whaling activist, Sea Shepherd captain Paul Watson, said he was shot during a clash with Japanese whalers in the Southern Ocean on Friday, but survived because he was wearing a kevlar vest. But Japan's fisheries agency said coastguard officials aboard the whaling ship had only thrown "flash grenades", which are used for crowd control and are not regarded as weapons. Watson told Australian radio from his ship that anti-whaling activists threw "stink bombs" on to the Japanese whaling factory ship the Nisshin Maru. The Japanese retaliated throwing "flash grenades" on to the deck of the Steve Irwin and during the clash, Watson said he was shot. It bruised my shoulder but it would have hit my heart if I didn't have the vest," Watson said. Sea Shepherd posted photos on its news Web site showing Japanese throwing smoking canisters and Watson holding what he said was a bullet and a dented badge hit by the object. "I didn't see anyone shoot at me and it was pretty hard for any of the crew to see anything because everyone was ducking from these flash grenades," said Watson. Australia's foreign affairs department initially said it had been told by Japan that warning shots had been fired, but later clarified its statement saying Japanese whalers fired three "warning balls", also known as "flashbangs". "He must have heard the bang of the flash grenade and got a shock," the fisheries ministry official said.

China kills suspected terrorists, prevents 'air disaster'
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The terrorists killed and captured more than a month ago in the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region had planned an attack targeting the Beijing Olympic Games, a senior official said here on Sunday. Chinese police smashed a terrorist gang in late January in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, killing two and arresting 15 others. Knives, axes, grenades and books about terrorism were seized. "Obviously, the gang had planned an attack targeting the Olympics," said Wang Lequan, chief of the Xinjiang autonomous regional committee of the Communist Party of China on the sidelines of the national parliamentary session. The group was said to have collaborated with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a group the United Nations labeled a terrorist organization in 2002. "Those terrorists, saboteurs and secessionists are to be battered resolutely, no matter what ethnic group they are from," said the official, adding that such evil forces usually attempt to deceive the world under the name of ethnic and religious causes. Wang vowed to adopt a strike-first policy against the "three evil forces" of terrorists, separatists and extremists, saying "we are prepared to strike whenever their conspiracies are detected." The attackers were stopped in time, and all the passengers and crew members on board were safe, according to Nur Bekri, chairman of the autonomous regional government, who added that further investigation is still going on. BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China on Friday foiled a planned attack on a passenger plane taking off from Urumqi, capital of the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, an official said here on Sunday. The China Southern Airlines aircraft took off at 10:35, and landed in Lanzhou, capital of neighboring Gansu Province, at 12:40 Friday, before reaching its destination Beijing, because "some people were attempting to create an air disaster," said Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang regional government, on the sidelines of the ongoing parliament session.

New York governor Spitzer tied to prostitution ring
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal prosecutors have unsealed an affidavit that details a rendezvous in a Washington hotel room last month between a prostitute and a client who a source tells CNN was New York Gov. The affidavit does not mention Spitzer by name, but a source with knowledge of the case said the subject identified as Client-9 is the governor. Spitzer took office in January 2007 after serving eight years as the state's attorney general, when he rose to national prominence as a hard-charging prosecutor. Spitzer, who is married with three children, went before reporters Monday to confess to an undisclosed personal indiscretion, saying he had acted "in a way that violates my obligations to my family, that violates my or any sense of right and wrong."

According to the affidavit, defendant Temeka Rachelle Lewis -- who is accused of working as a booking agent for the club -- wrote a text message Monday, February 11, asking the operation's day-to-day organizer to "pls let me know if (Client-9's) 'package' arrives 2mrw.

Gay Iranian awaits decision on asylum
LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain says it will reconsider the asylum application of a gay Iranian teenager who claims he will be persecuted if he is returned home. Mehdi Kazemi believes he will face persecution if he is made to return to Iran. Friday's announcement came after the European Parliament urged a resolution to the case and said that Iran routinely detained, tortured and executed homosexuals. The case of 19-year-old Mehdi Kazemi has been in limbo after Britain initially rejected his asylum request. He fled to the Netherlands and sought asylum there -- but the government turned him down, saying the case should be dealt with in Britain, where he first applied. "Following representations made on behalf of Mehdi Kazemi, and in the light of new circumstances since the original decision was made, I have decided that Mr. Kazemi's case should be reconsidered on his return to the UK from the Netherlands," British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said in a statement.

Anti-China protesters clash with police in Tibet
Stones were thrown and buildings burnt in Lhasa An emergency official said that many people had been hurt and an unspecified number had died. The US-based Radio Free Asia quoted witnesses who said they had seen at least two bodies on Lhasa's streets. Tibet's government would "deal harshly" with the protesters, its Chairman Qiangba Puncog warned. "We will deal harshly with these criminals who are carrying out activities to split the nation," he told the Associated Press news agency, denying that police had opened fire. China's state-run Xinhua news agency earlier said police had fired warning shots and used tear gas to disperse protesters. Rallies have continued all week in what are said to be the largest protests against Beijing's rule in 20 years.

China: Dalai Lama's comments are 'downright nonsense'
Special report: Dalai's separatist activities condemned BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- High-ranking Tibetan officials refuted Dalai Lama's "cultural genocide" and "terror rule" remarks on Sunday and said such arguments were a tale of a tub and "downright nonsense." Dalai cited the "rule of terror" and "cultural genocide" in its latest separatist remarks after the Lhasa riot, according to media reports. "Should the Dalai separatists group not spoil (the stability in Tibet), Tibet would be in its best period of development in history," said Lhasa Mayor Doje Cezhug. "Nowadays, Tibetan people have been living a modern life while enjoying the development of traditional Tibetan culture." Legqog, director of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan Regional People's Congress, said that "'the rule of terror in Tibet', as Dalai claimed, was downright nonsense." "The concept of 'citizen' didn't even exist in the old Tibet," he said. "Under the serfdom rule, slaves had nothing and were traded by their owners. They suffered all kinds of excruciating tortures." "The Tibetan people only started to manage their own affairs after the regional autonomy was inaugurated in 1965," Legqog said. Monks and the public enjoy full religious freedom," Legqog said. The Party and government has attached great importance to the cultural development of Tibet and have carried out a large scale of survey, salvage and protection for Tibet's cultural relics, said Qiangba Puncog, Tibet Autonomous Regional Government chairman.

Visionary and author Arthur C. Clarke dead at age 90
Sir Arthur C Clarke was famous for his science fiction writing The Somerset-born author achieved his greatest fame in 1968 when his short story The Sentinel was turned into the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. His visions of space travel and computing sparked the imagination of readers and scientists alike. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse paid tribute, hailing the writer as a "great visionary". Since 1995, the author had been largely confined to a wheelchair by post-polio syndrome. He died at 0130 local time (2000 GMT) of respiratory complications and heart failure, according to his aide, Rohan De Silva. Far-seeing scientist "Sir Arthur has left written instructions that his funeral be strictly secular," his secretary, Nalaka Gunawardene, was quoted as saying by news agency AFP. He served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, and foresaw the concept of communication satellites. When asked why he never patented his idea for communication satellites, he said: "I did not get a patent because I never thought it will happen in my lifetime." In the 1940s, he maintained man would reach the moon by the year 2000, an idea dismissed at the time.

But in a statement, they said: "We embarked on this course of action reluctantly, indeed with a heavy heart, as we did not wish the pursuit of it to become a distraction from our sole aim - finding Madeleine." They called on Portuguese police investigating her disappearance to end their status as suspects [in Portuguese, arguidos]: "We hope that the Portuguese authorities lift our arguido status in the very near future so that everyone can focus on finding our beautiful little girl."

"The exceptional publication of these apologies, together with today's statement of full apology in open court before Mr Justice Eady, was the only just and proper response by Express Newspapers following our complaint."

Major US presidential candidates have passport files breached
State Department employees snooped through the passport files of three presidential candidates — Sens. Barack Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain — and the department's inspector general is investigating. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the violations of McCain and Clinton's passport files were not discovered until Friday, after officials were made aware of the unauthorized access of Obama's records and a separate search was conducted. The incidents raise questions as to whether the information was accessed for political purposes and why two contractors involved in the Obama search were dismissed before investigators had a chance to interview them. It recalled an incident in 1992, when a Republican political appointee at the State Department was demoted over a search of presidential candidate Bill Clinton's passport records. McCormack said one of the individuals who accessed Obama's files also reviewed McCain's file earlier this year. The individual no longer has access to passport records, he said. "I can assure you that person's going to be at the top of the list of the inspector general when they talk to people, and we are currently reviewing our (disciplinary) options with respect to that person," McCormack said. Apologizing and investigating Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke with all three candicates on Friday and expressed her regrets. After speaking with Obama, Rice told reporters: "I told him that I was sorry, and I told him that I myself would be very disturbed." The State Department said the Justice Department would be monitoring the probe in case it needs to get involved.

Muqtada al-Sadr calls for end to fighting
BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called on followers to stop shooting and cooperate with Iraqi security forces Sunday, a move Iraq's government praised as a step toward ending six days of fighting that has left hundreds dead. A Shiite fighter runs toward an Iraqi Army armored vehicle Sunday after clashes near a TV station in Basra. "We announce our disavowal from anyone who carries weapons and targets government institutions, charities and political party offices," al-Sadr said in a nine-point statement issued by his headquarters in Najaf. The statement was accompanied by demands that the Iraqi government issue a general amnesty to his followers and release any being held. The move was welcomed by Iraq's government, whose forces have been fighting al-Sadr's militia, the Mehdi Army, in six days of clashes with so-called "outlaws" who had taken control of much of the southern city of Basra. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who had vowed not to leave Basra until his government reclaimed control of the city, called al-Sadr's statement a "step in the right direction" and said he hoped it would help to stabilize the region. But Iraqi authorities said after al-Sadr's announcement they would lift an indefinite curfew that had been imposed on Baghdad since Thursday.

Two UN contract workers kidnapped in Somalia
(Recasts with UN statement, adds details) By Ibrahim Mohamed and Mohamed Abdi MOGADISHU, April 1 Somali gunmen on Tuesday kidnapped two contractors, a Briton and a Kenyan, working for a U.N.-funded project in southern Somalia, the United Nations said. Local militias were pursuing the kidnappers in the hope of freeing the captives, residents said, and local clan elders were pressing the gunmen to release the two men. "Two foreign nationals -- a Briton and a Kenyan -- were abducted this morning by unknown gunmen between Saakow and Bu'aale in Middle Juba," the U.N. country office for Somalia said in a statement. The two work for Genesys International Corporation Ltd of Bangalore, India, which has been hired by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation to carry out a survey of the Juba and Shabelle rivers, the statement said. "Witnesses on the ground say there was gunfire when the men were taken, but there is no information to suggest that any serious injury was sustained by either man," it said, referring to reports that one of the men had been wounded. The two are being held in or near the town of Jilib, and "clan elders and community leaders who do not condone such abductions are putting pressure on the perpetrators to release the men," the statement said. Local elders and militiamen pursued the kidnappers toward Jilib district, 280 km (175 miles) south of Mogadishu. "These foreign men have been in Sakow for three days, there is no tight administration there and they have not contacted us over their security. We are just trying our best to free them safely," regional chairman Ibrahim Noleye said. Kidnapping is a lucrative business for Somali criminals, who usually treat their captives well, seeing them as investments on which they expect to earn a good return in the form of ransom. But kidnapping is relatively rare in southern Somalia as the region is too dangerous for most aid workers.

Gen. Petraeus, Amb. Crocker testify before US Armed Services Committee
In a reprise of their testimony last September, Army Gen. David H. Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker came to Capitol Hill today to tell lawmakers that security has improved in Iraq and that the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has taken steps toward political reconciliation and economic stability. But unlike in September, when that news was fresh and the administration said a corner had been turned, even some of the war's strongest supporters in Congress have grown impatient and frustrated. Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, and Crocker are facing many lawmakers today and tomorrow who had expected more by now and who are wondering whether any real change will occur before the clock runs out on the Bush administration. "I think all of us realize we're disappointed at where we are," Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said at a hearing last week. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.) asked, "How do we get out of this mess?" While the cost in U.S. lives and money increases, said another senior GOP senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity: "We cannot . Among the questions these and other lawmakers said they plan to ask Petraeus and Crocker is why the United States is still paying for Iraqi domestic needs ranging from military training to garbage pickup when the Maliki government has $30 billion in reserves -- held in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland -- as well as $10 billion in a development fund, significant budgetary surpluses from previous years and a projected 7 percent economic growth rate for 2008. "They're perfectly content to watch us spend our money while they build up these huge cash reserves from oil windfalls.

Pope Benedict XVI visit to the United States begins
Miguel Lenarduzzi travelled for 24 hours by van from Texas to join more than 13,000 of the faithful from across the US to welcome Pope Benedict XVI to Washington today. "We made a long trip. But our faith is bigger than that. The thousands of people here just want to say hi to the Pope," the 43-year-old waiter said. With the country in the grip of Pope-mania, about 9,000 gathered on the White House lawn to hear the pontiff. Another 4,000-plus without tickets, like Lenarduzzi, lined the streets outside to sing, pray and catch a glimpse of his motorcade. The Pope, making his first visit to the US since his election in 2005, was greeted on the White House lawn by President Bush, and given a 21-gun salute and a serenade from a top opera singer. Spectators sang happy birthday to Benedict — 81 today — who smiled, clasped his hands together and bowed in acknowledgement. Lenarduzzi, who travelled in a convoy of nine vans from Dallas, had four hours' sleep before getting up early to bag a spot in the street close to the White House. He and his noisy, banner-waving and guitar-playing retinue plan to follow the Pope for the next six days. There had been an expectation that this Pope, only the second to visit the White House, might not generate the same fervour as his predecessor, whose charisma he does not share.

'Expelled' producers accused of copyright violations
Having ruffled feathers in the scientific community, the filmmakers behind a documentary questioning evolution theory have now incurred the wrath of one of the most powerful figures in the popular music business, Yoko Ono, and have generated a blogosphere mini-drama in the process. The flap concerns the film's use of the song "Imagine," by the late John Lennon. Bloggers had accused Ms. Ono, Mr. Lennon's wife, of selling out... All: Well, it's been an interesting time since I first published this. I never thought that someone, far less Ben Stein, would take a song as famous as "Imagine" and use it in his film without permission. However, I have learned that in fact Yoko Ono did not license the song for use in the film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, and any use of the song in that film is being made without authorization. The movie, Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, has been reviewed and reviewed and discussed. I guess that the $20 million plus the estate earns every year isn't enough for Yoko Ono, not only does she feel the need to license the song out, she probably held out for the highest bidder, in this case, the money behind the movie, Walt Ruloff, who made over one hundred million dollars selling his company to Microsoft. (Irony is that a company who makes computers, perhaps the ultimate daily example of the higher power of science in our lives, indirectly funded a movie that doesn't believe science should be taught in schools.)

Pope addresses UN in NY as US visit continues
And in a passage that will have particular resonance for the current United Nations leadership, which is trying to establish the right of the outside world to intervene in situations where nations fail to shield their own citizens from atrocities, the pope said that “every state has the primary duty to protect its own population from grave and sustained violations of human rights.” Photo The concept, known as “responsibility to protect,” is one that Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general, has championed as a way for international institutions to take action in regions like Darfur. “If states are unable to guarantee such protection,” the pope said, “the international community must intervene with the juridical means provided in the United Nations charter and in other international instruments.” In an apparent allusion to countries that claim such international actions constitute intervention in their national affairs, he said instead they “should never be interpreted as an unwarranted imposition or a limitation of sovereignty.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story He added, “On the contrary, it is indifference or failure to intervene that do the real damage.” On his fourth day in America —and his first visit as pope — Benedict traveled north from Washington on “Shepherd One,” the Alitalia papal plane, to New York, where he will visit ground zero and celebrate Mass at Yankee Stadium before departing for Rome on Sunday night. He was greeted by Cardinal Edward C. Egan, head of the New York archdiocese, and a host of state and Catholic officials at a low-key ceremony on the tarmac of Kennedy International Airport. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After traveling by helicopter and motorcade to the United Nations, Benedict delivered a speech that touched on themes important both to his three-year-old papacy and his decades of writing as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At base, the pope presented the idea that there are universal values that transcend the diversity — cultural, ethnic or ideological — embodied in an institution like the United Nations, founded to help prevent the ruin of another world war. Thus religion, he said, cannot be shut out of a body like the United Nations, which he said aims at “a social order respectful of the dignity and rights of the person.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story “A vision of life firmly anchored in the religious dimension can help achieve this, since recognition of the transcendent value of every man and woman favors conversion of heart, which then leads to a commitment to resist violence, terrorism, war and to promote justice and peace,” he said. Photo Benedict was introduced to the thronged General Assembly hall by Mr. Ban, who called the United Nations a secular institution but is “home to all men and women of faith around the world.” Mr. Ban said the pope supported many of the goals of the United Nations, such as climate change, world peace, the eradication of poverty, and maintaining a dialogue among the world’s religions. The speech to the General Assembly is a papal tradition: Pope Paul VI made an appearance in 1965, and Pope John Paul II in 1979 and 1995. On Friday afternoon, Benedict met with members of the local Jewish clergy at the Park East Synagogue, a historic Upper East Side Orthodox congregation founded by Austro-Hungarian Jews in 1890. It was the first papal visit to a synagogue in this country, and only two other visits have ever been recorded, both in Europe.

Hillary Clinton wins Pennsylvania, cuts Obama's lead
A defiant Hillary Clinton signalled today she is staying in the Democratic race for the long haul after beating Barack Obama in the key Pennsylvania primary. With 95% of the precincts reporting, Clinton racked up 1,181,047 votes, 55%, to Obama's 972,236, 45%. Speaking at a victory party in Philadelphia, she vowed to fight on, in spite of Obama holding an almost unassailable lead overall. In a passionate speech, Clinton rejected calls from inside the party to bring the protracted contest to an end by standing down. "Some counted me out and said to drop out," she said. She said it was "long road" to the White House, and appealed for funds for her cash-strapped campaign, which is carrying a debt of $10m, in contrast with the millions Obama has raised. "Tonight, more than ever, I need your help to continue this journey ... We can only keep winning if we can keep competing with an opponent who outspends us so massively," she said. But he claimed that he had done better than expected, defying those who had said he would be "blown out of the water" and had closed the 20-point lead she had had the start of the Pennsylvania campaign. If the margin of Clinton's win had been small, she would have faced a chorus of calls today from senior Democrats to quit in the interests of party unity.

US claims North Korea helped Syria build reactor bombed by Israel
The White House was today set to reveal video images it claims support allegations that North Korea was helping Syria to build a nuclear reactor. The suspected reactor was destroyed by Israeli planes last September in a raid reminiscent of its 1981 raid on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq. Little remains known about the raid seven months later, and today's evidence has been keenly anticipated. US media reports said the video images – believed to have been obtained via Israeli intelligence - show Korean faces among the workers at the Syrian plant. The reports said the video also revealed that the Syrian reactor core's design was the same as that of the North Korean reactor at Yongbon, including a virtually identical configuration and number of holes for fuel rods. Following the Israeli attack, Syria kept relatively quiet about the bombing raid on its territory, bulldozing the area and constructing a new building on the exact location of the old one. Damascus refused to allow international nuclear inspectors to visit the location, fuelling suspicions that it had something to cover up. Speaking in London, the Syrian ambassador to Britain dismissed US accusations that it was helping build a nuclear reactor that could produce plutonium. Sami al-Khiyami told Reuters that the accusation was intended to put pressure on North Korea in talks about Pyongyang's nuclear programme. "This has nothing to do with North Korea and Syria," he said. "The cooperation between North Korea and Syria has nothing to do with [building] a nuclear facility. The Bush administration is going public with the video at a sensitive time in negotiations with North Korea about its nuclear programme.

Livingstone brands Boris 'a joke' in London mayoral elections

REUTERS/Stephen Hird LONDON Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone traded personal attacks on Wednesday as they made a final push for votes on the last day of campaigning in the London mayoral race. The Conservative hopeful sent half a million emails to Londoners accusing Livingstone of being "tired, out-of-date and beset by allegations of sleaze". The Labour mayor posted a million postcards with the message "Don't Vote for a Joke" and predicted voters would decide at the last minute that they couldn't risk electing Johnson. "The election is not a joke, it will affect the day to day life of every Londoner," Livingstone's campaign team said. In an interview, the mayor predicted that his rival would suffer from "hovering pencil syndrome", where voters decide at the last moment not to take a risk on a change at City Hall. "Although people may be toying with the idea of voting for Boris, when it comes to it they will find they just can't do it," he told Wednesday's Evening Standard newspaper. Livingstone's camp has repeatedly accused Johnson of not being a serious candidate. They have played on his popular image as a floppy-haired joker best known by many as the sometime host of "Have I Got News for You" and as a former newspaper columnist responsible for a string of gaffes.

Johnson ousts Livingstone in London mayoral election
His triumph capped an outstanding set of local election results for the Tories, and suggests David Cameron is well on course to become Prime Minister in two years’ time. The final declaration was delayed as record turn-out led tellers to continue counting ballots well into the evening. Mr Johnson’s victory was in part secured as a result of the increased numbers who took to the polls, as his team’s successful “doughnut strategy” of wooing natural Tories in the outer boroughs who in the past failed to vote in London elections proved devastating for Labour. The toppled mayor, Ken Livingstone, proved equally successful in getting the vote out in his inner London heartland, but was outnumbered by the more numerous suburban residents. Such was the strength of the campaign run by the Australian Lynton Crosby, that at one stage it even looked as if Mr Johnson would be declared the winner on first preference votes. In the end, it took the second preferences of the defeated Liberal Democrats and the minor parties to secure Mr Johnson victory by a margin greater than even he had hoped to dare for. The result means that Londoners have swapped one of the most colourful politicians in the country for an even more flamboyant character. The mayor-to-be spent the day at his home in North London, leaving only to go for a jog accompanied by a number of camera crews. Have your say: What kind of mayor will Mr Johnson be? Boris Johnson has won the race to become the next mayor of London - ending Ken Livingstone's eight-year reign at City Hall. The Conservative candidate won with 1,168,738 first and second preference votes, compared with Mr Livingstone's 1,028,966 on a record turnout of 45%.

In the first three minutes of her address, she asked supporters to contribute money, saying, “Tonight, I need your help to continue this journey.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Clinton advisers acknowledged that the results of the primaries were far less than they had hoped, and said they were likely to face new pleas even from some of their own supporters for her to quit the race. They said they expected fund-raising to become even harder; one adviser said the campaign was essentially broke, and several others refused to say whether Mrs. Clinton had lent the campaign money from her personal account to keep it afloat. The advisers said they were dispirited over the loss in North Carolina, after her campaign — now working off a shoestring budget as spending outpaces fund-raising — decided to allocate millions of dollars and full days of the candidate and her husband in the state. Incomplete results from Lake County — home to the city of Gary, just across the state line from Chicago — left the statewide tally in doubt early Wednesday. Photo With six primaries remaining on the Democratic calendar, the fight between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton now turns to Washington.

Large earthquake hits central China
CHENGDU, China (CNN) -- Rainy weather and poor logistics thwarted efforts by relief troops who walked for hours over rock, debris and mud on Tuesday in hopes of reaching the worst-hit area of an earthquake that killed nearly 10,000 in central China, state-run media reported. Setting out from Maerkang in Sichuan Province at 8 p.m. Monday, the 100 or so troops had to travel 200 kilometers (124 miles) to go before reaching Wenchuan, the epicenter of the quake, also in the province, Xinhua reported. After seven hours, they still had 70 kilometers (43 miles) to go. "I have seen many collapsed civilian houses, and the rocks dropped from mountains on the roadside are everywhere," the head of the unit, Li Zaiyuan, told Xinhua. Added CNN Correspondent John Vause: "The roads here are terrible in the best of times ... right now they're down right atrocious. They've resorted to going in one man at a time on foot." Nearly all the confirmed deaths were in Sichuan Province, but rescuers were hindered because roads linking it to the provincial capital, Chengdu, were damaged, Xinhua reported. Local radio quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. The earthquake was powerful enough to be felt throughout most of China. An expert told CNN the 7.9-magnitude quake at about 2:28 p.m. Monday (6:28 a.m. GMT) was the largest the region has seen "for over a generation." Residents as far as Chongqing -- about 200 miles from the epicenter in Sichuan Province -- spent the night outdoors, too afraid of aftershocks to sleep indoors. Local radio in Sichuan quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged.

Pakistan's coalition government faces split
ISLAMABAD May 13 Pakistanis are shocked by the split of a six-week-old coalition government on which they had pinned hopes for stability and change, and fear another bout of political polarisation and instability. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who heads the second biggest party in the coalition, announced on Monday his members, were quitting the cabinet after failing to reach agreement with the party of slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto on the restoration of judges fired by President Pervez Musharraf. The two parties defeated former army chief Musharraf's allies in a February election and their alliance had raised hopes for a stable civilian government in a country ruled by generals for more than half its history since its independence in 1947. "I voted in the hope that something good will happen but I don't see that," said Nighat Anis, a teacher at a school on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad. The fate of the judges has monopolised the attention of the coalition parters since the election, to the cost, critics say, of action on surging inflation, a slumping currency and stocks and the fight against militancy. The rupee PKR=PK has fallen more than 10 percent this year as the brewing political crisis has undermined a currency under pressure from a surging oil import bill and fiscal deficit. Nuclear-armed Pakistan's Western allies in the campaign against terrorism dread more instability in a country plagued by turbulence since March last year when Musharraf tried to dismiss the country's top judge, touching off protests. As part of his efforts to secure another term as president, Musharraf fired about 60 judges seen as hostile to him in November, after he imposed a brief state of emergency. "POLITICS OF VENDETTA" Sharif, the prime minister Musharraf ousted when he seized power in 1999, had made the restoration of the judges his main condition for joining a coalition with Bhutto's party, led by her widower, Asif Ali Zardari, since her assassination in December. But the restoration of the judges is likely to spark a showdown with Musharraf and the two leaders failed to agree on how it should be done. While pulling his party out of the coalition after a deadline for the return of the judges passed, Sharif promised not to destabilise it and to support it on an issue-by-issue basis.

Coordinated series of bombs kills at least 80 in India
The seven bombs killed 80 people including 10 children and injured another 200 when they went off over a 20-minute period in the city’s crowded bazaars on Tuesday evening. An eighth device failed to detonate. “We have arrested two people and have detained several more for questioning,” said Vasundhara Raje, the chief minister of Rajasthan state of which Jaipur is the capital. Mrs Raje, who belongs to the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, made a thinly veiled jibe at India’s neighbouring nuclear rival Pakistan. “This seems to have been done by some international group,” she claimed. Pakistan-based Islamic militants, fighting Indian rule in the disputed Jammu and Kashmir province, are blamed routinely for such attacks. The bombings on Tuesday were Jaipur’s first in an India wracked by terrorist attacks. Mrs Raje also said that the bombs used in the attack were a mix of plastic RDX explosive, ammonium nitrate and ball-bearings that acted like tiny missiles once the devices were detonated. Officials and witnesses said these ball bearings, which were yesterday still embedded in walls and doors in areas where the blasts took place, were largely responsible for the fatalities. Officials said the bombs were all tied to newly purchased bicycles and scattered in a 500 yard arc around the busy market place that is the hub of Jaipur’s emerald and gold market and the city’s principal commercial centre. Investigations had revealed that all the bicycles had been bought locally in Jaipur. "They (the bombs) were ensured to inflict the maximum damage at a time when the market was packed,” said R S Malik, a banker who witnessed one of the explosions near a Hindu temple.

US says polar bears are threatened species
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Polar bears will now be listed as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act. Scientists predict that two-thirds of the world's polar bears will disappear in the next 50 years. But in announcing the listing, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne said the decision should not be "misused" to regulate global climate change. But it should not open the door to use of the Endangered Species Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, power plants, and other sources," said Kempthorne. "That would be a wholly inappropriate use of the ESA law. The ESA is not the right tool to set U.S. climate policy." Watch Kempthorne explain the decision » While there are an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears now in the Arctic, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey predict two thirds of the world's polar bears will disappear in the next 50 years because of a decline in Arctic sea ice. Learn more about polar bears and their habitat » Controversy over the status of the polar bear is tied to the fact that this is the first time a species has been considered for listing specifically because its habitat is threatened by global warming.

John Edwards endorses Barack Obama
It would have meant more in February or March, but John Edwards' endorsement of Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination was welcomed nonetheless by a politician eager to turn the page. Edwards' surprise appearance at a rally Wednesday steered some of the attention away from Hillary Rodham Clinton's landslide win over Obama in Tuesday's West Virginia primary. Despite the victory, the former first lady faces long odds in trying to deny Obama the presidential nomination. Edwards had been their chief rival from 2007 through last January. But after finishing second to Obama in Iowa, the former North Carolina senator and 2004 vice presidential nominee placed third in the next three contests, then left the race. Obama and Clinton immediately sought his support, but Edwards stayed mum until Wednesday. The endorsement would have carried more clout had Edwards made it months ago, when the outcome of the Democratic contest was very much in doubt. "We are here tonight because the Democratic voters have made their choice, and so have I," Edwards said to thunderous applause. He said Obama "stands with me" in a fight to cut poverty in half within 10 years, a claim Obama confirmed moments later. Praise for Clinton Edwards told the rally that "we must come together as Democrats" to defeat Republican John McCain in November. "We are a stronger party" because of her involvement and "we're going to have a stronger nominee in the fall because of her work," he said. In America, he said, "you should never be homeless, you should never be hungry."

Child virus outbreak reaches Beijing
BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The death toll in China's outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease has risen to 42 children, with the capital Beijing reporting its first case Wednesday, state media said. Parents sit with children being treated for the virus in Fuyang, China, last month. The child died on the way to a hospital Sunday, health authorities told the Xinhua news agency. Another child died of the virus at a Beijing hospital, but that death was counted in the child's home province of Hebei, which neighbors Beijing, the news agency said. So far, the virus has sickened 24,934 children on the Chinese mainland, authorities said. The deaths are blamed on enterovirus 71, or EV-71, one of the most common causes of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD). The official count of infections has increased dramatically in recent days since an order issued late last week by the Ministry of Health mandating that all cases be reported. HFMD can be caused by a number of intestinal viruses, of which EV-71 and Coxsackie A16 are among the most common. Adults with well-developed immune systems can usually fend off the virus, but children are particularly vulnerable to it, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Senator Ted Kennedy dies at age 77
(CNN) -- A sampling of reactions to the death of Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died Tuesday night at age 77: Sen. Harry Reid says Kennedy's "mighty roar may now fall silent, but his dream shall never die." U.S. President Barack Obama: For five decades, virtually every major piece of legislation to advance the civil rights, health and economic well being of the American people bore his name and resulted from his efforts. I valued his wise counsel in the Senate, where, regardless of the swirl of events, he always had time for a new colleague. I cherished his confidence and momentous support in my race for the Presidency. And even as he waged a valiant struggle with a mortal illness, I've profited as President from his encouragement and wisdom. An important chapter in our history has come to an end. Our country has lost a great leader, who picked up the torch of his fallen brothers and became the greatest United States Senator of our time. You could see it, those of you who knew him and those of you who didn't know him. You could just see it in the nature of his debate, in the nature of his embrace, in the nature of how he every single day attacked these problems. And in the process of his doing, he made everybody he worked with bigger -- both his adversaries as well as his allies."

UK minor faces charges for calling Scientology 'cult' at protest
The boy, who is described only as a minor, was taking part in a demonstration outside the church's central London headquarters on May 10 when City of London Police officers ordered him to remove the placard. It read: "Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult." When he refused, he was issued with a form of summons for an alleged breach of public order. Police plan to pass a file to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether charges can be brought. After a complaint from the church, several demonstrators were told to remove signs but the youth was the only one who refused. A spokesman for the force said the youth had been "reported" under section five of the Public Order Act, which contains measures against displaying signs considered to be "threatening, abusive or insulting". The document did not specify any date for appearance in court. Writing anonymously on an internet forum, the boy said: "Within five minutes of arriving … I was told by a member of the police that I was not allowed to use 'that word'." Chief Supt Rob Bastable said: "City of London Police upholds the right to demonstrate lawfully, but we have to balance that with the right of all sections of community not to be alarmed, harassed or distressed as a result of other people's behaviour."

Bangladesh reports first human case of H5N1 bird flu
GENEVA The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday confirmed the first human case of bird flu in Bangladesh, a baby boy who has recovered, bringing the number of countries which have recorded human infections to 15. Bangladesh authorities announced the case on Thursday, and the WHO said it had been confirmed by a laboratory at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. It is the first in Bangladesh," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told Reuters. The 16-month-old boy was infected in January and has since recovered, he said. Bangladesh authorities informed the United Nations agency promptly about the case but it took time for the international laboratory testing to be completed, Hartl said. The H5N1 virus was first detected in Bangladesh in March last year and since then the authorities have culled around 2 million chickens and destroyed more than 2 million eggs. Avian influenza has spread through 47 of Bangladesh's 64 districts, causing losses of about 45 billion taka ($650 million) for the growing poultry sector, which accounts for 1.6 percent of the impoverished nation's gross domestic product. "When a disease is so widespread in poultry, it is really a matter of time before you get a human case. It shows the need to control the disease in animals if you are going to reduce the chances of transmission to humans," Hartl said. The virus rarely infects people but experts fear it could mutate or combine with the highly contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a pandemic, which could kill millions of people. Prior to the Bangladesh case, 14 countries had reported 382 cases including 241 fatalities since 2003, according to the WHO.

World Health Organization calls for ban on tobacco ads
World No Tobacco Day is held annually on 31 May The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called on governments to ban all tobacco advertising to help prevent young people taking up the habit. It accused manufacturers of using increasingly sophisticated marketing techniques to ensare young people, particularly girls in poorer countries. The UN agency says the more they are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely people will start smoking. The organisation said only 5% of the world's population was covered by comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. 'Dangerous messages' In Russia, which has few anti-smoking laws, the number of female and adolescent smokers has tripled in the last decade. However, in Canada, where smoking and cigarette advertising has been severely restricted, numbers of smokers are at their lowest in 40 years. The WHO also accused manufacturers of continuing to attract young people by "falsely" associating cigarettes with "glamour, energy and sex appeal". In a WHO worldwide survey of 13 to 15 year olds, 55% reported seeing billboard advertisements for tobacco, while 20% owned an item with a cigarette brand logo. Douglas Bettcher, director of the WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative, said a full ban was necessary to ensure young people were shielded from dangerous messages.

Helicopter carrying quake survivors crashes in China
China quake helicopter crashes with 14 on board Updated A military helicopter crashed while evacuating injured survivors of China's earthquake, underlining the lingering risks of a disaster that has left more than 68,000 dead. The chopper crashed on Saturday (local time) amid fog and strong turbulence as its crew of four was evacuating 10 injured residents from quake-hit areas in south-west China's Sichuan province, state-run Xinhua news agency said. The crash highlights the ongoing challenges as China seeks to respond to a tragedy that has also left nearly 15 million people homeless and raised fears of epidemic outbreaks in affected areas. The helicopter had ferried a team of military experts on disease outbreaks to Li county and was returning with the injured residents when it lost contact with ground command, Xinhua reported. President Hu Jintao, touring quake-stricken areas in neighbouring Shaanxi province, immediately ordered a search and rescue operation, Xinhua said. The overall death toll from the earthquake, China's worst natural disaster in a generation, reached 68,977 on Saturday, with another 17,974 missing, the Government said. The lake, formed when a huge landslide blocked the Jian River, has emerged as the most serious lingering threat to the region's traumatised citizens, as it poses a flood risk to areas populated by more than one million people. More than 197,000 people had been evacuated in case of flooding, officials told AFP, but a total of 1.3 million stood ready to move should the controlled release of water turn into a flood. Authorities had originally planned to blast the blockage away with dynamite but feared that could cause all the rubble to give away, thus letting loose a deluge. "About 1.3 million people are prepared for evacuation," a disaster relief official in Mianyang city downstream from the lake, who gave only his surname Pu, told AFP on Saturday.

US Senator Kennedy has brain tumor surgically removed

REUTERS/Chris Keane Senator Edward Kennedy waves as he walks out of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, May 21, 2008. REUTERS/Brian Snyder DURHAM, North Carolina U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Democratic icon and a leading backer of presidential contender Barack Obama, had successful surgery on Monday to remove a malignant brain tumor and should suffer "no permanent neurological effects," his surgeon said. "I am pleased to report that Senator Kennedy's surgery was successful and accomplished our goals," Dr. Allan Friedman said in a statement after a 3 1/2-hour operation at Duke University's Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. After the surgery, Kennedy told his wife, Vicki, "I feel like a million bucks," an aide to the senator said. Friedman, Duke's chief of neurosurgery, did not specify how much of the cancerous tumor he was able to remove. He called the operation "the first step" in a treatment plan for the 76-year-old senator from Massachusetts, head of America's most fabled political family. "After a brief recuperation, he will begin targeted radiation at Massachusetts General Hospital and chemotherapy treatment," Friedman said. Dr. Mark Gilbert of the University of Texas' cancer center, speaking at a news conference at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago, said: "If all you do is surgery, even if you do a beautiful job, the tumor will be back in one or two months" without other treatments. Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor called a glioma, a type of tumor that usually kills within three years, after suffering a seizure on May 17. Several doctors agreed that surgery in this region could affect a patient's ability to speak and understand language, and perhaps could paralyze the patient's right side as well.

Barack Obama effectively clinches Democratic nomination
(CNN) -- The titanic struggle for the Democratic candidacy neared its end Tuesday with final voting expected to push Hillary Clinton aside and usher in Barack Obama as the first ever black U.S. presidential nomination for a major political party. After months of primaries and caucuses, the Democratic party still does not have a nominee. Clinton's campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe told CNN Clinton will not concede at a New York rally being held after voting closes Tuesday night in the last two primary states. That was a reaction to an Associated Press story quoting two senior Clinton campaign officials as saying she will concede Tuesday night or early Wednesday that Obama has done enough to secure the Democratic nomination, while stopping short of formally suspending or ending her race. But Clinton told New York lawmakers she is willing to be the vice presidential nominee on Obama's presidential ticket, those lawmakers told CNN. Obama needs the support of about 40 more Democratic delegates to make the 2,118 needed to capture the nomination at the party's August convention but he is likely to depend on superdelegates -- party officials free to back any candidate -- to tip the balance. The Illinois senator, who has sought to dispel fears of inexperience by campaigning on a message of change, has emerged as favorite in recent weeks despite a dogged campaign by Clinton who as former first lady claims to have more political experience. Although campaigns for both parties said there had been no formal discussion, sources close to Clinton said she was poised to acknowledge her inevitable defeat by Tuesday signaling her willingness to accept an offer of becoming Obama's running mate if asked. "In her speech tomorrow night she will convey the message that first and foremost she is committed to Democrats winning in November and will do whatever she's asked to do," a close friend of the New York senator said. Her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, also told voters in South Dakota on Monday that "this may be the last day I'm ever involved in a campaign of this kind." Watch how the race could end » Obama insiders are said to be split over whether a joint ticket with Clinton will be a good idea, with some doubting she can deliver, despite claims the pairing would help "ram down the animosity" between supporters of the two that many fear could cost the Democrats the election. Democratic Party insiders are also discussing how to patch up Clinton's relationship with the black community and how to bring African American Clinton supporters into the Obama fold, several top Clinton supporters said.

On Tuesday, Pakistani investigators searched through the rubble at the scene of the explosion, which came weeks after al-Qaeda threatened Denmark over published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service, known as PET, said in a statement late Monday that the embassy was the likely target. "It is PET's assessment that al-Qaeda or an al-Qaeda-related group likely is behind the attack," agency director Jakob Scharf said. He added that "a series of other militant Islamic groups and networks in Pakistan also could have the intention and the capacity to hit Danish targets in Pakistan." The blast also comes as Pakistan seeks to deflect pressure to stop negotiating peace deals with militants in regions along the border with Afghanistan. It wounded some 35 people, left a deep crater on the road outside the embassy and severely damaged a development group's office nearby.

US and UK diplomats detained in Zimbabwe
(CNN) -- U.S. and British diplomats are safe after Zimbabwe police, soldiers and "war veterans" stopped their convoy Thursday and threatened to burn them alive, U.S. officials said. Ambassador James McGee visits a reported victim of political violence at a Harare clinic this month. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said five American Embassy employees and two local staff members had been detained. "While this immediate incident has been resolved, it will not be forgotten," McCormack said. Just hours after the incident, Zimbabwe Social Welfare Minister Nicholas Goche said that all aid organizations were ordered to cease operations in the country until the presidential runoff is concluded, a journalist in the country said. Despite Goche's announcement, Boniface Chidyausiku, the Zimbabwean ambassador to the United Nations, said CARE International was the only aid group told to suspend work. The government had accused some of the 300 CARE employees in Zimbabwe -- mostly Zimbabweans -- of passing out brochures in favor of an opposition political party, CARE spokesman Kenneth Walker said. Chidyausiku said the Zimbabwean minister of social services is reviewing the activity of all non-governmental organizations in light of accusations that some have been politicizing their operations and campaigning for the opposition. "What we find is that there have been complaints about NGOs operating as Trojan horses for the oppositions, but the opposition has denied it," he said. Fore told CNN that the "suspension is a direct threat to the lives and well-being of tens of thousands of innocent people in Zimbabwe." U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said, "This demonstrates this is a regime that is very much out of step with international norms."

Tsvangirai campaign rallies banned in Zimbabwe
By Farai Sevenzo Harare Basic foods are fast becoming beyond the reach of even those with jobs In the week in which world leaders met in Rome to discuss an ongoing global food crisis, will Zimbabwe's own food crisis be exacerbated by the announcement that aid groups and non-governmental organisations should stop operations at once and re-apply for their permits? Put together the facts - a recurring poor harvest of basic cereals like maize and wheat; persistent droughts; a farming infrastructure which has been in renewal or chaos; economic inflation beating even the projected figures - and you can see that this country is seriously in need of the kind of assistance these groups have been told to stop providing. And there are many of them, all channelling food for the needy throughout Zimbabwe from the UN, the World Food Programme (WFP) and elsewhere.

"No-one will talk for fear of jeopardising access to people who still need help," explains an doctor with the US Agency for International Development (USAid). Inaccessible countryside The charge against them is that they have been campaigning for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) under the pretext of distributing aid. And while undertaking all these tasks, it is the government's contention that medics are neglecting polio immunisation programmes in favour of distributing MDC campaign matter. Large parts of the countryside have become inaccessible to the media and to international agencies as roadblocks controlled by pro-government militias have sprung up.

Audiences would be able to watch live broadcasts of Olympic events via the satellite. The quality and coverage of the country's television and broadcasting services were to be increased, and people in remote regions of China would receive clear television programs. The China Great Wall Industrial Corporation (CGWIC), the contractor of the satellite launch, signed the launch service contract with China Satcom in November 2005. As the only company engaged in international commercial satellite launching services, CGWIC has launched 34 foreign satellites for 28 services.

Ireland rejects EU Lisbon Treaty
PA Photos Protestors calling for a No vote before the Lisbon treaty referendum, hand out flyers in Dublin city centre. Officials in Brussels and other European capitals appeared shell-shocked as they absorbed the news they had dreaded to hear on Friday the 13th: Irish voters had rejected the Lisbon Treaty aimed at updating the European Union's creaking institutions. Ireland's population of 4.2 million amounts to less than 1% of the E.U. 's 490 million citizens, but in the mire of the defeat that offered no comfort to E.U. The Union's consensus-based decision-making system requires that all 27-member states approve the treaty, and a veto by one is enough to torpedo it. Ireland was the only member state to submit the long and confusing document to a popular referendum, and the resulting "no" vote, by a decisive margin of 54% to 46%, has created a crsisis for the E.U. The Irish result set off a whirl of confusion, with officials struggling to suggest how the E.U. "The Treaty is not dead," said European Commission President José Manuel Barroso. The first step, he urged, would be to continue the process of ratification, a task all other member states have left to their parliaments. "The ratification process is made up of 27 national processes, 18 member states have already approved the treaty, and the European Commission believes that the remaining ratifications should continue to take their course," he said. If no immediate contingency plan is apparent, it is because the Lisbon Treaty was already the E.U.

Iran says its nuclear program is unchanged
(CNN) -- Iran's government spokesman on Saturday reiterated its right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes, a state-run news agency reported. Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki has suggested that Iran would never launch an unprovoked attack on Israel. Gholam-Hossein Elham made the remark to reporters a day after Iran delivered a response to a world powers proposal that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment in exchange for economic and other incentives, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. World leaders, such as those from the West, the U.N. Security Council and Israel, have been suspicious that Iran is using its nuclear program to develop weaponry. Iran has consistently disputed that and said it plans to use nuclear power for energy. Elham said "Iran's stand on the issue has not changed" and that Iran "will not withdraw from legitimate rights of its people," IRNA reported. "Tehran's stand is based on the legitimate rights of the Iranian nation as well as the international regulations. The Iranian nation will continue with the path determined by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei," Elham said. The incentives proposal to Iran was made last month by the foreign ministers of the five U.N. Security Council permanent members -- the United States, Britain, China, Russia and France -- and by the foreign minister of Germany, which has been involved in nuclear negotiations, and by European Union security chief Javier Solana. Watch what a deal could mean » Iran responded to those ministers on Friday. Saeed Jalili, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, told Solana in a phone call that Iran's response focused on "common ground between the two sides and a constructive and creative view," according to Iranian news reports. Along with the incentives, the European Union, acting on behalf of the world powers, also is offering a six-week "pre-negotiations" phase proposal, a gesture of goodwill and an effort to jump-start talks that have been at an impasse over Iran's nuclear aspirations. It is calling for suspending any new sanctions if Iran takes a six-week break from installing or manufacturing any more centrifuges that enrich uranium. That would mean Iran would be allowed to continue to use the more than 3,000 centrifuges it already has but could not manufacture more in that period.

Hurricane Bertha strengthens over Atlantic Ocean
Hurricane Bertha is seen in a satellite image taken on July 7, 2008. REUTERS/NOAA/Handout MIAMI Strengthening far more swiftly and vigorously than predicted, Hurricane Bertha became a "major" hurricane in the open Atlantic on Monday, with sustained winds of at least 115 miles per hour (185 kph), U.S. forecasters said. The second named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season was heading west-northwest in the direction of Bermuda when it became a Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity, the National Hurricane Center said. "A gradual turn toward the northwest with a decrease in forward speed is expected over the next couple of days," the Miami-based center said. That could take Bertha near Bermuda, a wealthy mid-Atlantic British colony that is viewed as one of the more storm-proof islands in the region, with tough building codes and a storm-conscious population. The National Hurricane Center said it did not expect Bertha to get much stronger due to unfavorable atmospheric conditions in its path. At 5 p.m. EDT, the storm's center was located around 1,150 miles southeast of Bermuda and it was moving at around 12 mph (19 kph) to the west-northwest. Energy markets have paid close attention Atlantic storms since the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, during which a number of powerful hurricanes ripped through the Gulf of Mexico, toppling oil rigs and severing pipelines. The record 2005 season, which included Katrina which swamped New Orleans and killed 1,500 people on the U.S. Gulf Coast, saw 28 storms.

Labour, which has yet to choose a candidate, said it was getting people off benefits and into work. The SNP campaign launched with a call for action on rising energy costs. During his campaign visit, Mr Cameron said it was the Conservative's mission "to heal the wounds of poverty, crime, social disorder and deprivation". He said social breakdown in Glasgow East was simply an "extreme version" of what could be seen elsewhere and highlighted the high level of welfare dependency and knife crime.

"It comes at a time when the country is asking 'What is going on with the knife crime and violence on our streets?'." "We can and will bring hope and aspiration to places where there is resignation and despair," he said.

Iran conducts nine missile tests
Advertisement The US and Israel have condemned Iran after it test-fired a long range missile capable of reaching Tel Aviv. Iran state media said nine missiles had been fired in total, including a new Shahab-3, with a range of 2,000km (1,240 miles). Tehran has tested the missile before, but the latest launch comes amid rising tensions with the US and Israel over the country's nuclear programme. A senior US state department official said the launch was "provocative". Wednesday's early morning test at a remote desert site sent oil prices climbing. Israel should prepare itself to do what is needed to do Ze'ev Boim Israeli minister Brig Gen Hoseyn Salami, commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' air force, said: "Our missiles are ready for shooting at any place and any time, quickly and with accuracy." Western leaders have been attempting to convince Tehran to stop enriching uranium, which it has continued doing despite sanctions from the UN and the European Union, insisting its nuclear programme is purely for civilian energy. US Under-secretary of State William Burns said that thanks to UN sanctions, Iran's real progress on its nuclear programme had been "modest", despite its sabre-rattling. "We view force as an option that is on the table but a last resort," he told a Congressional hearing on Wednesday. Our correspondent - who is in Israel - says the country has a fully operational anti-ballistic missile system, which Israeli military experts believe can counter any Iranian threat.

Chaotic first day for iPhone 3G
Sang Tang / AP A customer looks at a new Apple iPhone 3G at the Apple retail store in Regent Street, London. Anticipation quickly turned to frustration on Friday for the millions of Apple customers trying to upgrade their old iPhones to the new software, or activate their newly purchased iPhone 3G. With Apple's servers overloaded and unable to accommodate customer demand, eager buyers who had camped out all week to acquire the new phone were thwarted. Though the new-generation phones were designed to be activated in-store, salespeople instructed customers Friday to go home, connect the phone to a personal computer and download new software to activate it. Apple did not return phone calls or emails asking for an explanation of its launch-day problems, but by 10 p.m. EST on Friday, this reporter at long last reached a technical support representative, who identified himself only as George: "It's been crazy the whole day," he said. The logjam was a major misstep for a company that markets its products as simpler, more elegant and easier to use than the competition's. "The store is basically broken at this point," said Michael Rose, a blogger for tuaw.com, which reports on Apple. When he tried to upgrade his older iPhone Touch early Friday to take advantage of the new software, he says he received an error message informing him the iTunes store was unavailable (the iPhone must be authenticated through Apple's iTunes program to complete a software upgrade). "I haven't figured out how to use this thing properly," Kroll told TIME at the end of the business day on Friday. Although he was able to make phone calls, when he tried to load applications onto the new phone, he received a perplexing error message stating that applications in his iTunes library could not be installed on the new iPhone for lack of authorization.

GENOA, Italy (Reuters) — An Italian court found 15 police officers guilty on Monday of beating protesters at the Group of 8 summit meeting in Genoa in 2001. It sentenced them to prison terms ranging from five months to five years. All of those convicted are expected to appeal; none can go to prison until the appeals process is complete, which normally takes years. The heaviest sentence was given to an inspector in the penitentiary police department. The police were accused of organized brutality at the Diaz high school, where protesters were camping during the summit meeting, and later at the Bolzaneto police barracks, where arrested protesters were taken. The three-day summit meeting in 2001 was a focus of protests by antiglobalization, left-wing and anti-American demonstrators. · Sentences up to five years for mistreatment in 2001 · Verdict likely to embarrass Berlusconi government Fifteen Italian police officers and doctors were last night sentenced to jail terms of up to five years after being found guilty of abusing protesters detained during riots at the 2001 G8 summit in Genoa. Thirty other defendants were cleared of charges ranging from assault to the denial of basic human rights. The sentences totalled less than a third of what had been demanded by the prosecution. But they will nevertheless be embarrassing for Silvio Berlusconi and his rightwing allies, in office in Italy both then and now. The court heard former detainees including Britons testify that they were insulted, beaten and sprayed with asphyxiating gas.

French police search for missing explosives
PARIS French anti-terrorism police are investigating the theft of 28 kg (61 lbs) of plastic explosives from a site near the southeastern city of Lyon, officials said on Friday. Staff at a mine clearance centre at Corbas, near Lyon, noticed that thieves had apparently broken into the site, which was not guarded, and taken explosives and detonators. Interior ministry spokesman Gerard Gachet told France's LCI television that the director of the centre had been suspended for allowing the explosives to be stored at the unsecured site. Semtex has been used by various terrorist groups French anti-terrorist officers are searching for 28kg (61lb) of Semtex explosive missing from a depot in the suburbs of the city of Lyon. France's interior ministry confirmed an investigation was underway, saying the manager of the site had been suspended. Semtex is a powerful explosive favoured by terrorist groups as it is odourless and difficult to detect. The depot, in a disused 19th century fort at Corbas, is used for storing explosives by a civil defence unit charged with the job of blowing up bombs and ammunition left over from the two world wars. Police said the discovery that the Semtex was missing was made on Friday but admitted the explosives could have been taken up to a week ago. In a statement released late on Friday the interior ministry said there had been "security failings" which had made the theft possible. Police sources have declined to confirm a newspaper website report which said that the store had been unguarded. A bomb containing about half a kilogram of the explosive caused the blast which brought down Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people. About 62 pounds (28 kilograms) of explosives were stolen from a depot at the civil security site at Fort de Corbas, the ministry said in a written statement, because of an apparent breach in the site's protection.

Human cells grow blood vessels in mice
WASHINGTON Cells taken from human bone marrow, blood and umbilical cords grew into functioning blood vessels in mice with just the right coaxing, U.S. researchers reported on Saturday. The so-called progenitor cells teamed up to form working blood vessels that connected to the circulatory systems of the mice, the team at Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital Boston reported. "What's really significant about our study is that we are using human cells that can be obtained from blood or bone marrow rather than removing and using fully developed blood vessels," said Harvard's Joyce Bischoff, who led the study. Her team used immature cells, known as progenitor cells, grown under special lab conditions before being implanted into mice. Once implanted, the cell mixture grew and differentiated into a small ball of healthy blood vessels, they reported in the journal Circulation Research, published by the American Heart Association. They used endothelial progenitor cells, which mature into cells that line the blood vessels, and mesenchymal progenitor cells, which differentiate into the cells that surround the lining and provide stability. A mixture of cells from adult blood and bone or from umbilical cord blood worked the best, they said. They hope to find a way to help the body replace blocked or damaged blood vessels, such as arteries blocked in a heart attack or stroke. "What we are most interested in right now is speeding up the vascularization," Bischoff said in a statement. If you have an ischemic tissue, it's dying tissue, so the faster you can establish blood flow the better." One ultimate goal is to replace some heart surgery with injections of laboratory-grown cells that would establish themselves in the body, providing a system of blood vessels for damaged hearts that need more oxygen, said Juan M. Melero-Martin, a co-author of a paper in the July 18 issue of the journalCirculation Research: Journal of the American Heart Association. "We are proving the concept in mice who are compromised so that they don't reject human cells," said Melero-Martin, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital Boston.

Two nuclear leaks in two weeks trigger security and safety reviews in France
French nuclear companies are hoping to play a central role in the government's plan to build a new generation of reactors. At home, however, the industry has been buffeted by a series of mishaps. Angelique Chrisafis reports from Bollène Sylvie Eymard's Provence farmhouse kitchen should be the picture of French rural calm. But the stockpiles of bottled water, disinfectant rinse and disposable paper plates hint at something strange. For the past two weeks, Eymard, 41, and her children, 13 and seven, have had a phobia of taps. To wash up, they go out to the yard and fill a bowl from a specially delivered plastic tank of purified water on a fork-lift tractor. They carry the water up to the bathroom to wash. Even the dog drinks bottled water, and it is left out for the birds. The view from the house over the fields is dominated by the nearby cooling towers of the Tricastin site, a nuclear power plant run by EDF, the company which is poised to buy British Energy and take control of most UK nuclear stations. Next to the plant is a nuclear treatment centre run by a subsidiary of Areva, the nuclear group which hopes to design many of the new British reactors. Last month an accident at the treatment centre during a draining operation saw liquid containing untreated uranium overflow out of a faulty tank.

Hole in fuselage causes Qantas flight to make emergency landing
The flight with 365 people on board was flying from London to Melbourne, via Hong Kong when it was forced to land. Less than two hours after flight QF 30 left Hong Kong this morning, the pilot sought an emergency landing at Ninoy Aquino International Airport after reporting a hole in the plane's cargo section near the right wing. The plane was flying at 29,000 feet when its fuselage ruptured causing the cabin to lose air pressure. Passengers on the flight have said that the plane plunged about 20,000 feet and a door apparently popped open. Qantas has confirmed the plane has landed at Manila and is being inspected on the tarmac, but will not say what caused the emergency landing. "The pilot has some pressurisation warnings about a door on the left hand side of the aircraft, but exactly what went wrong is still being determined," he said. Speaking from the Manila airport, passenger Dr June Kane says she heard a loud bang from underneath the plane, and saw debris fly through the cabin. "I'm looking at the plane now and on the left hand side, just forward of the wing, there's a gaping hole from the wing to the underbody," she said. "It's about two metres by four metres and there's baggage hanging out so you assume that there's a few bags that may have gone missing."

US presidential candidate Obama speaks in Berlin, Germany
BERLIN — He didn't break into German, but he spoke of tearing down walls of division, and the crowd loved it. Tens of thousands of Germans, along with some resident Americans, filled Berlin's Tiergarten park to hear Barack Obama talk about the U.S., Europe and their shared visions and challenges. It was a remarkable turnout for the lazy days of late July, when most Germans are more focused on summer vacations than foreign politics. The audience repeatedly interrupted his speech with applause and cheers, and erupted in chants of "Yes, we can!" A lot of Europeans are hoping Obama will give them a reason to love America again. "I expect Obama to be a president who makes it possible to be proud of being a fan of the USA," said Gerda Schulz, a 72-year-old retiree. Schulz has watched historic speeches here by a string of American presidents -- John F. Kennedy in 1963, Ronald Reagan in 1987 and Bill Clinton in 1994 -- and on Thursday added the Democratic presidential contender to the list. "In the last seven years, it was rather embarrassing here to say, 'I like the Americans and I am thankful for what they did for us,' " she said. (CNN) -- Barack Obama touched hearts during an impassioned speech to a 200,000-strong crowd in Berlin, German newspapers agreed, but suspicions remain about the White House contender's motives for courting a European audience. Berlin's Der Tagesspiegel wondered whether so many young people had ever gathered for a political event in Germany and said that Obama's address -- which echoed speeches by former U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan when the divided city was in the Cold War frontline -- could only have been made in the German capital. But with its symbolism and the message of this 46-year-old, it certainly was the signal of a new era for a new generation on both sides of the Atlantic," the newspaper said.

Puffin numbers are falling on UK's Farne Islands
By Mark Kinver Science and nature reporter, BBC News  England's biggest colony of puffins has seen the birds' numbers fall by a third in just five years, a survey shows. Experts had expected to see a slight increase in the population on the Farne Islands, owned by the National Trust. The Trust says the size of the decline is unprecedented, adding that it will carry out another survey in 2008 in order to monitor the situation. One theory is that many of the birds are dying from starvation during the eight months they spend at sea. "We were expecting a slight increase because since the last survey in 2003, we had a number of good years for puffins," explained David Steel, the Trust's head warden on the islands. "There were plenty of chicks fledging from the nests, so we were not only getting enough to maintain the population, but increase it. Advertisement Winter losses The three-month survey, carried out on eight of the islands, recorded 36,500 breeding pairs. The population of puffins on the Farne Islands had been growing steadily Mr Steel told BBC News that there was no visible explanation for the decline on the islands. "The birds had been bringing in good quantities of food, and there was not a predator problem on the islands." One suggestion for the downturn is the survival rate over the winter months, when the puffins spend eight months at sea.

NASA to extend the Phoenix probe mission by 5 weeks
The Phoenix spacecraft has tasted Martian water for the first time, scientists reported Thursday. By melting icy soil in one of its lab instruments, the robot confirmed the presence of frozen water lurking below the Martian permafrost. Until now, evidence of ice in Mars' north pole region has been largely circumstantial. In 2002, the orbiting Odyssey spacecraft spied what looked like a reservoir of buried ice. After Phoenix arrived, it found what looked like ice in a hard patch underneath its landing site and changes in a trench indicated some ice had turned to gas when exposed to the sun. Scientists popped open champagne when they received confirmation Wednesday that the soil contained ice. "We've now finally touched it and tasted it," William Boynton of the University of Arizona said during a news conference in Tucson on Thursday. Phoenix landed on Mars on May 25 on a three-month hunt to determine if it could support life. It is conducting experiments to learn whether the ice ever melted in the red planet's history that could have led to a more hospitable environment. It is also searching for the elusive organic-based compounds essential for simple life forms to emerge. Researchers were able to prove the soil had ice in it because it melted in the oven at 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 Celsius) — the melting point of ice — and released water molecules.

UN renews Darfur peacekeeping mission
“We don’t think it should be loaded up like a Christmas tree with a bunch of other topics,” said Richard Grenell, the spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations. “We made it clear from the beginning that trying to introduce the I.C.C. language into a simple roll-over resolution was problematic.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The language had already been heavily diluted from what was first proposed by Libya and South Africa, with the support of Russia and China, among others, that would have invoked Article 16 in the court charter, which allows the Security Council to suspend action by the court for a year. Moscow and Beijing reiterated their positions after voting. China, which has about 300 engineers in the peacekeeping force, said its priority was to allow negotiations to proceed and, among other goals, to avoid putting its soldiers in harm’s way. The indictment threatens to derail any future negotiations, Ambassador Wang Guangya suggested, by wrecking any trust between Sudan and the United Nations. “No progress will be possible without the full cooperation of the Sudanese government,” Mr. Wang said, calling the proposed indictment “an inappropriate decision made at an inappropriate time.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Wang said China would soon bring to the Security Council the idea of postponing any action by the international court.

Sudan’s United Nations ambassador, Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem, called the court prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, “a screwdriver in the workshop of double standards.” Given that the peacekeeping force relies heavily on contributions from African countries, the general sentiment was that some reference should be made to their concerns. Most countries accepted the idea that the fight over Article 16 could be postponed.

Suspect in 2001 anthrax attack dies of apparent suicide
In the early days after the letter attacks, in September and October 2001, Dr. Ivins joined about 90 of his colleagues at the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in a round-the-clock laboratory push to test thousands of samples of suspect powder to see if they were anthrax. Later, in April 2002, he came under scrutiny in an Army investigation of a leak of potentially deadly anthrax spores outside a sealed-off lab at Fort Detrick. He later admitted he had discovered the leak but not reported it. A federal law enforcement official said that Dr. Ivins had been regarded as a strong suspect and that agents had been nearing an arrest, and a lawyer familiar with the investigation said he believed that prosecutors had planned to charge only Dr. Ivins. The link between Dr. Ivins’s suicide and the federal investigation was first reported on Friday in The Los Angeles Times. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined on Friday to make public its case against Dr. Ivins, noting that evidence was under court seal as part of a grand jury investigation. Officials said they were briefing the victims of the anthrax letters — those who recovered, as well as family members of those who died — and would need to go to court to have evidence unsealed before it could even be summarized for the public. A lawyer who had represented Dr. Ivins since May 2007, Paul F. Kemp, insisted that Dr. Ivins was innocent and had been driven to suicide by false suspicions.

Sixteen policemen killed in suspected terrorist attack in Xinjiang, China
・A raid of a border armed police division in Xinjiang Monday morning killed 16 policemen. ・The incident was suspected as a terrorist attack, according to the local police. ・The police said the two attackers had been arrested, and one of them got a leg injury. URUMQI, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) -- Terrorist plot was suspected in the violent attack targeting border police in China's westernmost city of Kashi, which left at least 16 policemen killed and 16 others injured Monday. The attack occurred in the front of the Yiquan Hotel, which is nearly 200 meters away from the Kashi border armed police division, Xinhua correspondent reported from Kashi. The reporter said the police investigation found that two attackers drove a tip lorry to hit a team of policemen who were jogging to pass the hotel in a regular morning exercise at about 8:00 a.m. The suspects then got off the lorry to throw explosive and hack the policemen with knives, after the vehicle veered to knock on a roadside wire pole, said the Kashi police. The reporter corrected the previous account of the raid of the border armed police division, saying that the attackers did not break into the division station and the explosion took place outside the station. Xinhua reporter saw blood stain left on the sidewalk, although the accident site had been cleaned by police. The police said the two attackers had been arrested, and one got a leg injury in the raid. The regional public security department said it had got intelligence that the "East Turkistan Islamic Movement" planned to make terrorist attacks during Aug. 1-8, just ahead of the opening of the Olympic Games in Beijing.

Microsoft study proves six degrees of separation
What are the odds you are connected to an Argentinean folk singer? They're probably better than you think. According to a new study by Microsoft, not only are the odds pretty good, but you can probably be linked to anyone else by fewer than seven acquaintances. The findings throw more science behind the old "small world" theory that all strangers are connected through people they know, popularized by a trivia game about the interconnectedness between the rest of the world and actor Kevin Bacon. "What's the distance between you and any random person on the planet? That's the kind of result we were seeking," Microsoft researcher Eric Horvitz told "Good Morning America." Horvitz and fellow Microsoft researcher Jure Leskovec looked at over 30 billion conversations over Microsoft Messenger in June 2006. The conversations represented about 180 million people around the world, according to a report by the Washington Post. Play They found that on, average, any two random people were connected by 6.6 people. "To me, it was pretty shocking," Horvitz told the Washington Post. "What we're seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity. But we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore." For years now, the "small world" theory found practicality in a trivia game called the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, in which competitors would attempt to connect the actor with other actors using as few links as possible.

Vitamin C can help prevent cancer say the National Institutes of Health
BEIJING, Aug. 5 (Xinhuanet) -- High-dose injections of vitamin C, also known as ascorbate or ascorbic acid, can stop the spread of cancer and slow the growth of tumours by 50 percent in lab mice tests. In a study in Tuesday's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) injected ascorbate into the veins or abdominal cavities of rodents with aggressive brain, ovarian, and pancreatic tumors," delivering "up to four grams per kilogram of body weight daily." The researchers, however, tested the idea that ascorbate, when injected at high doses, may have prooxidant instead of antioxidant activity. Prooxidants would generate free radicals and the formation of hydrogen peroxide, which, the scientists hypothesized, might kill tumor cells. By injecting mice with 43 cancer and five normal cell lines, the researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested, while sparing normal cells. Scientists involved with the study also pointed to evidence that "these high ascorbate concentrations could be achieved in people." Vitamin C, which is found in fruit and vegetables, plays a critical role in health, and a prolonged deficiency leads to scurvy and eventually to death. Vitamin C was considered as a possible treatment for cancer three decades ago, but fell out of favour when studies where the vitamin was given orally failed to live up to expectations. News in Science Injected vitamin C cuts cancer growth Injections of high doses of vitamin C have almost halved the rate of tumour growth in mice, leading US researchers to believe it may be useful in the treatment of cancer in humans.

Mauritania president Abdallahi arrested in coup
Mauritania coup leaders seize President, PM Updated A coup has taken place in the north-west African republic of Mauritania, where the army has seized the President and the Prime Minister after the President sacked several top army officers. A presidency source says soldiers seized President Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, Prime Minister Yahya Ould Ahmed Waghf and the interior minister, and took them to an unknown destination. Troops have also shut down Mauritania's state radio and television, witnesses say. The President's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, has confirmed that presidential guardsmen seized have seized her father. "The security agents of the BASEP (Presidential Security Battalion) came to our home around 9.20 and took away my father," she said. France's foreign ministry says a group of Mauritanian army generals is reported to be holding Mr Waghf. "We are in contact with our embassy to obtain confirmation of the events that appear to be taking place in Nouakchott," a ministry spokesman said. "Based on initial information, it seems that a group of generals are holding the Prime Minister." In a decree published earlier on Wednesday by the national news agency, Mr Abdallahi sacked army chief of staff General Mohamed Ould Cheikh Mohamed Ahmed Ghazouani and presidential guard chief Mohamed Ould Abdelaziz. Mr Abdallahi replaced one government in May following criticism over its response to soaring food prices and to attacks over the last year carried out by al Qaeda's north African arm. But the new government resigned last month in the face of a proposed no-confidence vote which prompted a cabinet reshuffle.

Bin Laden's former driver convicted of supporting terrorism
This was the first US war crimes trial since World War II Osama Bin Laden's former driver has been sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison at the first US military trial in Guantanamo Bay. Salim Hamdan was convicted on Wednesday of supporting terrorism, but acquitted of conspiracy to murder. Prosecutors had demanded a sentence of not less than 30 years. On time served Hamdan could be released in five months but the Pentagon has said he will still be retained as an "enemy combatant". The US has always argued it can detain such people indefinitely, as long as its so-called war on terror continues. The Pentagon said Hamdan would serve his sentence and then be eligible for review. Regret The BBC's Kim Ghattas at the trial says the sentence is a dramatic snub to the Bush administration and came after just one-and-a-half hours of deliberation. The jury of six US military officers, not the judge, imposed the sentence under the tribunal rules. "It is my duty as president [of the jury] to inform you that this military commission sentences you to be confined for 66 months," a juror told Hamdan. HAMDAN CHARGES Conspiracy: Not guilty of two counts of conspiring with al-Qaeda to attack civilians, destroy property and commit murder Providing support for terrorism: Guilty on five counts, including being the driver and bodyguard for Osama Bin Laden, a man he knew to be the leader of a terrorist group. Not guilty on three other counts All sides claim victory Profile: Salim Hamdan Timeline: Al-Qaeda Our correspondent says Hamdan looked nervous as he walked in for sentencing but after hearing it, he told jurors: "I would like to apologise one more time to all the members and I would like to thank you for what you have done for me." The judge, Navy Capt Keith Allred, told Hamdan: "I hope the day comes when you return to your wife and your daughters and your country."

Several large explosions reported in Xinjiang, China
(Adds details of injured suspects, background of unrest) By Chris Buckley BEIJING Aug 10 A series of blasts killed at least two people in China's restive far northwest Xinjiang on Sunday, underscoring volatile tensions there two days into the Olympics and less than a week after a blast killed 16 police. The blasts in central Kuqa, a major town in southern Xinjiang more than 3,000 km (1,860 miles) from Beijing, occurred before dawn, Xinhua news agency quoted witnesses as saying. "Casualties of the incident may still rise, Xinhua reported, citing witnesses who "saw flashes of fire and heard sporadic gunshots after the explosions". No group has claimed responsibility or been blamed for the blasts, but Chinese officials have said militants seeking an independent homeland for Xinjiang's largely Muslim Uighurs are one of the top security threats to the Beijing Olympics, which started on Friday. "With these special circumstances and the special background of the eve of the Beijing Olympic Games, hostile forces at home and abroad will surely act like cornered mad dogs and step up their terror and sabotage activities," said the governor of Xinjiang, Nuer Baikeli, in the Xinjiang Daily on Friday. Many of Xinjiang's 8 million Uighurs chafe at the strict controls on religion that China enforces and resent influxes of Han Chinese migrant workers and businesses. Uighurs now make up slightly less than half of its 20 million people, and most of the rest are Han Chinese. Kuqa county, where the town of the same name lies, is an ethnically mixed area with a population of some 450,000 that has seen unrest. In April, Xinjiang's hardline Communist Party chief, Wang Lequan, visited Kuqa and told officials "stability comes before all else", according to a report on the Kuqa government website (www.xjkc.gov.cn).

Russia advances into Georgia from Abkhazia
GORI, Georgia Aug 11 At least six Georgian attack helicopters bombed targets in the region around the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali, a Reuters witness said. The action appeared to countermand a Georgian declaration of an end to military activity over the separatist region. The reporter said the helicopters flew from Georgia proper and attacked targets just over the de facto boundary with South Ossetia, sending dark smoke billowing into the air. Russia had earlier accused Georgia of shelling Russian troops, which drove Georgian forces from Tskhinvali this week. TBILISI Aug 10 Russian troops advanced 40 km (25 miles) from separatist Abkhazia to the town of Senaki inside Georgia proper on Monday, the Georgian Interior Ministry said. Senaki lies outside the so-called security zone that runs along the de facto Abkhaz boundary with the rest of Georgia. Russian peacekeepers have been stationed since the territory broke away in the 1990s. "The have advanced in dozens of APCs (armoured personnel carriers) and are now in Senaki," Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili told Reuters. The Russian Defence Ministry said that its operation in Senaki, which sits 30 miles outside the Abkhaz border, was necessary to avert renewed Georgian attacks on South Ossetia. A Georgian Interior Ministry spokesman said that Russian forces had also moved into the town of Zugdidi and seized police stations. The deployments into areas beyond the disputed territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia follow a threat from Moscow that Russian forces would move into the main area of the country if Georgian troops refused to disarm.

Under the deal signed on Thursday, the US will install 10 interceptor missiles at a base on the Baltic coast in return for help strengthening Polish air defences. A top general in Moscow said the move would worsen ties with the West already strained by the Georgian conflict. 'Worsen ties' Russia's envoy to Nato has meanwhile been quoted as saying the timing of the deal shows its true purpose is to counter Russia's "strategic potential".

Ceasefire signed in Georgian-Russian conflict
It soon became clear that Russian forces had turned this provision to their advantage as Russian troops, pushed further into Georgia and seized full control of the central city of Gori in recent days. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Rice addressed these concerns, and called for the speedy deployment of an international peacekeeping force for the two separatist enclaves, which would make any further Russian presence unnecessary. She said Russian and Georgian troops must now pull back to the positions they occupied before hostilities began over a week ago. Only Russian troops performing a true peacekeeping role should remain in the two enclaves, she said. Standing beside Mr. Saakashvili in Tbilisi, Ms. Rice said: “This must take place and take place now.” Tensions between Washington and Moscow have risen sharply in the past 24 hours, as Russia’s president and foreign minister made it clear that they would support separatist efforts by two breakaway Georgian territories and as the specter of a resurgent Russia helped persuade Poland to agree to a long-stalled deal on an American missile defense system.

Iran tries to launch satellite with Safir carrier rocket
Advertisement Iran says it has successfully launched a rocket capable of carrying its first domestically built satellite. Officials said only the rocket had been fired, correcting state media reports that the communications satellite itself had been sent into orbit. Tehran has pursued a space programme for years, despite international concern over its nuclear plans. In February it sent a probe into space as part of preparations for the launch of the satellite. Long-held ambition Footage aired on Irinn (Islamic Republic of Iran News Network) showed the launch of the Safir rocket in darkness. The presenter said that the satellite launch was a trial which was successful. State and military officials confirmed the launch had taken place. In October 2005 a Russian-made Iranian satellite named Sina-1 was put into orbit by a Russian rocket. White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said: "The Iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions.

Olympic highlights: August 20, 2008
Britain's Olympic medal haul was given a surprise boost after Tasha Danvers produced a superb run to seal a bronze medal in the women's 400m hurdles. The London-born athlete, who has endured an injury-plagued season and almost failed to make the British team, qualified for the world championship final last year but finished last in that race and has never previously threatened the medal placings in major championships. But her time of 53.84sec was enough for third place today, with Jamaica's Melaine Walker taking gold and Sheena Tosta of the USA taking silver. Blonska, 30, failed a test in the early hours after last weekend’s competition and now faces a lifetime ban for what is a second doping offence if she is found guilty by an IOC disciplinary commission which is expected to report its findings today. Sotherton condemned Blonska at last summer’s world championships in Osaka, calling her a cheat and claiming that she should not have been allowed back into the sport after testing positive for the steroid, stanozolol in 2003. On that occasion, Blonska had beaten Sotherton to the silver medal but the Briton’s gain in Beijing will only mean her moving up a place, from fifth to fourth. “I have not seen any of her results since early June and then she comes out here and is producing good performances, which was suspicious. “I hope the Russian and American will be upgraded and get their medals in a proper, official presentation, otherwise they have lost that moment forever. I’m happy I’ve moved up one place but I’m still disappointed with my performance.” If she is found guilty of a doping offence, the immediate punishment for Blonska would be the loss of her medal and expulsion from the Games.

Campaign offices for John McCain evacuated in Centennial, Colorado and Manchester, New Hampshire, USA
DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- Suspicious letters, one containing white powder, received at two of Sen. John McCain's campaign offices were not dangerous, police and fire officials said. Sen. John McCain's camp received two threatening letters, including one that contained white powder. The two letters were sent to a campaign office in suburban Denver and to an office in Manchester, New Hampshire. It was initially reported that the Denver letter contained an unknown white powder and a threatening message, but a fire department spokesman said there was no white powder, just a small amount of an unknown substance. The substance tested positive for protein, the official said. Manchester Police said they examined the letter and found no dangerous substance. The letter drew suspicions because it had a Denver return address, a campaign spokesman said. Four or five people from the office drove themselves to a nearby hospital, said Bruce Williamson of the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office. The people were treated and released after the hospital determined they were not ill. Others in McCain's office were evacuated, Williamson said. Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain smiles during a campaign stop at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan July 18, 2008. The letter arrived in the mail in the afternoon, and the campaign immediately notified local and federal law enforcement authorities, said Jeff Sadosky, a spokesman for the campaign in suburban Washington, D.C. McCain, 71, a Republican senator from Arizona, was taking the day off from the campaign, spending the day at his home in Sedona, Arizona.

US candidate Barack Obama announces Joe Biden as his running mate via text message
His e-mail announcement began: “Friend — I have some important news that I want to make official. I’ve chosen Joe Biden to be my running mate.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The selection was disclosed as Mr. Obama moves into a critical part of his campaign, preparing for the party’s four-day convention in Denver starting on Monday. Mr. Obama’s aides viewed the introduction of his vice presidential choice — including an afternoon rally Saturday at the old State Capitol in Springfield, Ill., the same place where Mr. Obama announced his candidacy on a freezing winter morning almost two years ago — and a tour of swing states as the beginning of a week-long stretch in which Mr. Obama hopes to dominate the stage and position himself for the fall campaign. Word of Mr. Obama’s decision leaked out hours before his campaign had been scheduled to inform supporters via text and e-mail message, and hours after informing two other top contenders for the vice presidential nomination — Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and Gov. As the selection process moved to an end, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, whom Mr. Obama had defeated in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, had slipped out of contention — to the degree that Mr. Obama had never seriously considered her.

Afghan government: More than 90 civilians killed by US airstrike
KABUL, AFGHANISTAN — President Hamid Karzai on Saturday denounced an airstrike by U.S.-led forces that his government said killed 76 Afghan civilians. Civilian casualties are an extremely sensitive subject in Afghanistan, where the government has repeatedly pleaded with Western troops to exercise greater care to avoid injuring and killing noncombatants. The U.S. military initially put the number of dead at 30, describing all of those killed Friday in a remote part of Herat province, on Afghanistan's western border, as Taliban militants. On Saturday, U.S. spokesmen said that five of the dead were believed to be women or children, and that allegations of a much higher and predominantly civilian death toll would be investigated. Accounts of the fighting provided by Afghan authorities, human rights groups and the U.S. military have varied widely, and the remoteness of the area made it difficult to determine exactly what had happened. ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 23 -- U.S. military officials said Saturday that they are investigating allegations by Afghan officials that a U.S.-led bombing raid killed at least 70 civilians in western Afghanistan in the past week. Lt. Col. Rumi Nielson-Green, a spokeswoman for the U.S. military, said 30 Taliban insurgents were killed in the operation, which targeted a compound occupied by a local Taliban commander. "We're confident that we struck the right compound," she said. But Afghan President Hamid Karzai said in a statement that about 70 civilians were killed in the raid. Raouf Ahmedi, a spokesman for the western regional command of the Afghan army in Herat, said Afghan military officials who inspected the site Saturday found the bodies of 60 children and 19 women among the dead. "We couldn't and we haven't found any identification showing they are Taliban," Ahmedi said.

US presidential race tied as the Democratic National Convention starts
DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- It's a dead heat in the race for the White House. Both John McCain and Barack Obama had the support of 47 percent of people questioned in the CNN poll. The first national poll conducted after Barack Obama publicly named Joe Biden as his running mate suggests that the battle for the presidency between the Illinois senator and John McCain is all tied up. In a new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Sunday night, 47 percent of those questioned are backing Obama, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominees, with an equal amount supporting his Republican opponent, McCain. "This looks like a step backward for Obama, who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "Even last week, just before his choice of Joe Biden as his running mate became known, most polls tended to show Obama with a single-digit advantage over McCain." It may be supporters of Hillary Clinton, who still would prefer the New York senator and former first lady as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee. » Sixty-six percent of Clinton supporters -- registered Democrats who want Clinton as the nominee -- are now backing Obama. "The number of Clinton Democrats who say they would vote for McCain has gone up 11 points since June, enough to account for most, although not all, of the support McCain has gained in that time," Holland said. She suspended her bid for the White House and backed Obama in early June, after the end of primary season.

Oldest Catholic boarding school in Australia at centre of child-sex claims
Bathurst head 'not aware' of current sex abuse Updated The principal of Bathurst's St Stanislaus College says he is not aware of any current paedophile activity at the school. John Edwards says he received information several years ago about alleged sexual misbehaviour at St Stanislaus during the 1980s, and forwarded it to police. In May, police charged a 65-year-old former priest with 33 counts of sexual assault and gross acts of indecency against five boys. Mr Edwards says the allegations are "gravely concerning" and he hopes they are properly dealt with by the courts. "It is absolutely a requirement for this matter to be open, for this matter to be addressed and this matter to be resolved," he said. "This school is very concerned to ensure that children are treated well and that their interests are protected." The commander of the Bathurst-based Chifley Command, Superintendent Michael Goodwin, says the investigation is ongoing. "If there's anyone out there that is currently concerned they may be the subject of this particular investigation they are urged to come forward in the strictest confidence and contact CrimeStoppers," he said. "These allegations happened some 20-odd years ago, there is absolutely no suggestion whatsoever that the college involved is/has been looking to anything in the current day. "I don't know anything about eight alleged other victims, I've not been served with any witness statements so I really can't comment about it," he said.

Barack Obama accepts US presidential nomination from the Democratic Party
(Recasts 1st paragraph; adds details, background) By Steve Gorman LOS ANGELES Aug 29 Over 38 million Americans tuned in for television coverage of Barack Obama accepting the Democratic nomination for U.S. president on Thursday in what is believed to be the most watched convention speech ever. Obama's TV audience, reaching nearly a fourth of all U.S. households, was by far the largest of the four-day Democratic National Convention, surpassing the addresses by his running mate, U.S. Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, and his onetime rival for the nomination, Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York. It also easily eclipsed the acceptance speeches of either of Obama's two immediate Democratic predecessors or the 27.6 million viewers President George W. Bush drew on the fourth night of the Republican National Convention in 2004, when he was nominated for a second term. Obama's historic address, by the first African American chosen to lead a major political party in the race for the White House, averaged 38.4 million U.S. viewers across all major networks, Nielsen Media Research reported on Friday. That figure is the highest for any single night of any major party convention going back to 1996, the last election cycle for which Nielsen keeps night-by-night data. The 1992 conventions as a whole garnered higher household ratings in prime time than this week's Democratic gathering in Denver, meaning a larger percentage of homes were tuned in to those earlier events. The same is true for most conventions held from 1960 to 1984. But because today's household ratings translate into a larger number of individuals based on population growth, Nielsen analyst Anne Elliot said Obama's audience tally is probably the biggest for any televised convention speech in history. Moreover, Nielsen is now including time-shifted viewing by people watching later the same day through digital video recorders -- data not included in previous cycles.

Alaskan governor Sarah Palin chosen by McCain as Vice Presidential running mate
DAYTON, Ohio, Aug. 29 -- Sen. John McCain confounded conventional wisdom Friday by announcing first-term Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate, a decision that guarantees that either an African American or a woman will ascend to the White House for the first time in history next year. The senator from Arizona lived up to his maverick reputation, bypassing former rivals and more experienced governors to choose the little-known Palin, 44, as the person "who can best help me shake up Washington." The self-described "hockey mom" brings a blue-collar conservatism and strong antiabortion views to the ticket and appeals to a party base sometimes suspicious of McCain. She made an immediate pitch to female voters, especially those who had supported Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries, saying that her selection "could help shatter the glass ceiling once and for all." But she is also less than two years into her term as governor, and her only previous political experience came as mayor of the town of Wasilla, which has a population of about 6,700. After a raucous rally here before what the campaign said were 15,000 supporters -- the largest gathering of McCain's campaign -- the two spent six hours together. They traveled by bus to Pittsburgh, ingratiating themselves to Ohioans as they bought Ohio State Buckeye paraphernalia and stopped for ice cream at a roadside stand. The trip provided valuable bonding time for two people who acknowledge they barely know each other. McCain met Palin at a governor's conference in February, and did not see her again until she secretly flew to Arizona on Wednesday night. After a phone interview with the senator on Sunday night, she arrived in the state three days later for a session with McCain's two top lieutenants. She met with McCain's wife, Cindy, on Thursday morning at the couple's Sedona ranch, then McCain joined them and offered her the job on the deck of the house around 11 a.m. Thursday. While Palin, pronounced PAY-lin, had been mentioned as a dark-horse candidate for the job, she was never described as being on the shortlist under consideration by McCain.

Memorial for toddler who died under care of controversial '1 Mind Ministries' group
They wore all white, refused medical care, referred to themselves with titles such as "Princess" and "Queen," talked to the walls and attempted to banish demons. From the moment that Ria Ramkissoon and her baby boy Javon joined the tiny religious cult, 1 Mind Ministries, in April 2006, her life would change irrevocably. Now, the 21-year-old woman is sitting in the psychiatric unit of a city jail in Baltimore accused by police of slowly starving her son to death and allowing cult members to beat him for disobeying orders such as saying "amen" at meals. After he stopped breathing in his mother's arms, they stuffed Javon's body into a green suitcase, which cult leader "Queen Antoinette" occasionally sprayed with Lysol to cover up the stench, drove to Philadelphia and left the suitcase inside a shed where it sat for a year until police made the gruesome discovery in April, according to a statement of charges. Play In total, five members of the cult, including Ramkissoon, have been charged with murder. A bail hearing for Ramkissoon, who is charged with first- and second-degree murder, child abuse, assault, reckless endangerment and conspiracy, is set for today. "She sounded like an empty shell," Seeta Khadan-Newton told ABCNews.com. "She sounded like she was going to die. She said she didn't know how this happened, that it wasn't supposed to happen that way… She's not doing well. She had a confrontation with somebody, and she's in the psychiatric ward right now." Khadan-Newton still remembers that fateful day in 2006 when she dropped off her daughter and grandson at a house in West Baltimore, assuming that a babysitter lived there to take care of the boy while Ramkissoon went to school. "They told me not to come back to get her because they would drive her home.

At the least, Republicans close to the campaign said it was increasingly apparent that Ms. Palin had been selected as Mr. McCain’s running mate with more haste than McCain advisers initially described.

Work on Lehman Brothers’ rescue to continue over weekend
Lehman Brothers has lost 80% of its market value since Monday. Executives at Lehman Brothers are racing to meet a deadline of Sunday night to find a new owner for the troubled US bank, the BBC has learned.

Los Angeles commuter train collides with freight train; over two dozen killed
A commuter train engineer who ran a stop signal was blamed Saturday for the nation's deadliest rail disaster in 15 years, a wreck that killed 25 people and left such a mass of smoldering, twisted metal that it took nearly a day to recover all the bodies. A preliminary investigation found that "it was a Metrolink engineer that failed to stop at a red signal and that was the probable cause" of Friday's collision with a freight train in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell said. She said she believes the engineer, whose name was not released, is dead. "When two trains are in the same place at the same time somebody's made a terrible mistake," said Tyrrell, who was shaking and near tears as she spoke with reporters. Authorities later announced that the effort to recover bodies from the Metrolink train's crushed front car had ended, with the death toll at 24. It rose to 25 when a 50-year-old man transported to a hospital from the wreck died. Firefighter Searcy Jackson III, a 20-year veteran and one of the first to pull bodies from the wreckage, said he had never seen such devastation.

Russian Boeing 737 crashes with 88 aboard
MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- A passenger jet caught fire early Sunday, exploded and crashed into railway tracks in the central Russian city of Perm, killing all 88 people on board. Wreckage from the Aeroflot-Nord Boeing 737, which crashed near Perm, lies across a railway track. The exact cause of the pre-dawn crash is under investigation, but government spokesman Vladimir Markin said "a technical breakdown" was a likely cause. Markin said in televised remarks that the failure of one of the Boeing 737-500's two engines may have caused the plane to come down, The Associated Press reported. "We think it's very doubtful that it was the result of a terrorist attack, because at the scene, there were no traces of explosives as we know for now," said Lev Koshlyakov, Deputy Director General of Aeroflot. When the sun rose, pieces of the Aeroflot jet were strewn about the railroad tracks. "It slammed in front of my house, and there was a huge flame," an unidentified woman in Perm told Russian state television. She said the impact of the crash "threw me across my sheets.... Then my daughter ran in from the next room and asked if a war had started." "It looked like a comet," she said. The jet was en route to Perm from Moscow when the pilots lost communication with air traffic control just before landing about 3:10 a.m. (2110 GMT), an Aeroflot official said.

Royal Society education chief forced out in creation row
Creationism should be included in science lessons to reduce the confusion among the rising numbers of schoolchildren who have been brought up to reject the principles of evolution, one of the country's leading scientists said yesterday. Citing evidence that more than one in 10 children in British state schools now believes in creationism, Professor Michael Reiss, the director of education at the Royal Society, called for such beliefs to be discussed and debated in class by science teachers, but not taught as a subject. The professor, who is also an ordained Church of England clergyman, said the move would help pupils understand that such literal beliefs in religious scripture are not supported by scientific evidence. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the body responsible for the national curriculum, has ruled that discussion of creationism should be omitted from the science curriculum because creationism is "not a scientific theory". But at the British Association's science festival at Liverpool University, Professor Reiss said it was necessary for this to change. "I'm trying to make it less likely that students will ignore science, that they will detach from it, because it makes them feel that they cannot continue with science because it conflicts with their beliefs... But I feel if a science teacher feels comfortable with it then it could reduce confusion." Surveys show that more than 10 per cent of children believe that the Earth is only a few thousand years old rather than the four billion years or so accepted by science. "We have an increasing number of children in schools from Muslim backgrounds and a very high proportion of Muslim families have creationist beliefs," Professor Reiss said. "Secondly, while Christianity as a religion is becoming less important in British society, within Christianity there is quite a high proportion of families that do hold fundamentalist beliefs, and that often means they are creationists." "A better way forward is to say, look, I simply want to present you with the scientific understanding of the history of the universe and how animals and plants and other organisms have evolved."

Russian markets to remain closed until Friday
The Kremlin is in crisis mode, pledging a $20 billion boost Thursday to shore up Russia’s battered markets as it seeks to ward off a financial crash and restore confidence in its fragile banking sector. For a second day, stock markets remained closed after a dizzying plunge in share prices, triggered by a wave of panic selling and margin calls. MICEX, where most trading takes place, fell 25 percent in three days this week and has lost 56 percent since its May peak. The government, which sits on the world’s third-largest financial reserves, has clutched for breathing space by simply halting trading as it debates a raft of measures designed to bring relief to the markets and the banking system — suffering from a lack of liquidity, or ready cash to operate with. It rushed Thursday to introduce measures to ease the burden on the banks. It pledged to lend a further 60 billion rubles ($2.36 billion) to the country’s three largest banks — Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank — in an attempt to filter money down to smaller lenders, who have less ability to access funding. “Everybody’s sitting on a lot of cash, but nobody wants to lend it to anybody else,” said Hawk Sunshine, head of investment banking at Metropol investment bank. “Yes, the Central Bank is giving a ton of money to Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank, but are they going to give it to anybody else? He ordered his government to consider putting up to 500 billion rubles ($20 billion) into the country’s financial markets, a move that provided an immediate boost to Russian shares trading as American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, in London. Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said the government would use the money to buy securities on the stock market if shares remain undervalued for an extended period, the RIA-Novosti news agency reported. “If they simply buy shares in order to dispose of them at a later time ... that would make a lot of sense. The Central Bank said last week it spent a net $5.3 billion from its foreign currency reserves in the first 10 days of September to prop up the ruble — which has plunged as capital is whisked out of the country.

Contaminated baby's milk induces wave of child illness in China
HONG KONG, Sept. 21 (UPI) -- The Chinese tainted milk scandal spread to Hong Kong Sunday, with officials saying a 3-year-old girl had been hospitalized with a kidney stone. Citing unnamed sources, The Daily Telegraph reported Sunday that Hong Kong's Princess Margaret Hospital was treating a girl who regularly drank milk supplied by Yili, one of China's two biggest dairy companies. The British newspaper said Hong Kong officials yanked all Yili products off the shelves last week after some were found to contain the banned additive melamine, sometimes used by farmers and wholesalers to disguise substandard and watered down milk. The Telegraph also said the Dutch firm Friesland Foods, which sells Chinese-supplied milk in Asia under the Dutch Lady label, has recalled its products after a milkshake tested positive for melamine. BEIJING -- Milk came off the shelves in supermarkets, schools and Starbucks outlets across China -- and in markets in Hong Kong and Singapore -- as the scandal that began with poisoned baby formula spread in earnest to milk and other products from some of the country's biggest, most venerable dairy brands. A person close to the situation said China's government is considering a recall of all locally produced dairy goods and could force all companies to reapply for permission to sell their products. BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The number of children sickened by suspected melamine-tainted milk products in China has more than doubled and apparently spread beyond mainland China -- raising fears that the impact of the tainted products could be more widespread that initially thought. China's Health Ministry announced Sunday that 12,892 infants and young children have been sickened by tainted milk powder -- more than double the number previously reported -- according to state-run Xinhua news agency. Of these, 104 have serious symptoms, and 1,579 have been cured and discharged, the agency said. Previously, Chinese officials said more than 6,200 children had been sickened by melamine found in baby formula. In addition, nearly 40,000 other infants and young children have received outpatient medical treatment and consultation as a result of the tainted milk, Xinhua reported on Sunday. Watch CNN visit the company at the center of the scandal » The latest statistics from mainland China come after Hong Kong reported late Saturday that a 3-year-old girl has been sickened by a suspected melamine-tainted milk product -- the first known illness outside of mainland China.

Pakistan says its military fired on U.S. aircraft 'violating' its airspace
Tensions show no sign of abating in the border area Pakistani troops have fired warning shots at two US helicopters forcing them back into Afghanistan, local Pakistani intelligence officials say. The helicopters flew into the tribal North Waziristan region from Afghanistan's Khost province at around midnight, the reports say. Tensions have risen after an increase in US attacks targeting militants. The incident comes amid mounting security fears after a militant bomb attack on the Islamabad Marriott hotel. Pakistan's army has said it will defend the country's sovereignty and reserves the right to retaliate to any border violations. The government has said it will take targeted action against the militants, promising raids in some "hotspots" near the border with Afghanistan. Meanwhile in the city of Peshawar, Afghan consul Abdul Khaliq Farahi was kidnapped after six unidentified men ambushed his car, officials say.

FBI begins widespread financial probe of 26 firms
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The FBI is investigating Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers and AIG - and their executives - as part of a broad look into possible mortgage fraud, sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Tuesday. Two officials with knowledge of the FBI investigation into the mortgage crisis said "the investigation is all very preliminary". They said there is a lot of anger and people want someone held accountable. Officials are looking into whether any criminal activity occurred, but the Bureau said the investigation will take some time. They said the investigation is in the preliminary stages, and so far it is a broad look at the companies involved. At this point, the officials said they are not pursuing specific individuals at the four firms under investigation because these firms are facing serious financial problems and they need to find out if it's the result of criminal activity. "Don't expect indictments tomorrow or next week or next month," one of the officials told CNN. FBI spokesman Special Agent Richard Kolko had no comment on that information, but said 26 firms are currently under investigation as part of the bureau's mortgage fraud inquiry. Earlier this month, FBI Director Robert Mueller told Congress that 1,400 individual real estate lenders, brokers and appraisers are now under investigation in addition to two dozen corporations. "As we have seen, this number can fluctuate over time; however we do not discuss which companies may or may not be the subject of an investigation."

McCain delays campaign, Obama says continue the debates
(CNN) -- Presidential candidates Sen. John McCain -- who said Wednesday that he was suspending his campaign because of the nation's economic crisis -- and Sen. Barack Obama will meet Thursday with President Bush to discuss a proposed Wall Street bailout. McCain suspended his campaign, saying it was time for both parties to come together to solve economic crisis. McCain and Obama accepted Bush's invitation to discuss the proposed $700 billion bailout with him and congressional leaders at the White House, the candidates' aides said Wednesday night. Also Wednesday night, McCain and Obama said in a joint statement that the bailout plan was "flawed" but that "the effort to protect the American economy must not fail." "Now is a time to come together -- Democrats and Republicans -- in a spirit of cooperation for the sake of the American people," read the statement, which was released about 15 minutes before Bush made a televised address on the economy. Earlier Wednesday, McCain announced that he would suspend his campaign to go to Washington and participate in negotiations on the bailout plan, and he called for a postponement of Friday's presidential debate. Watch McCain's announcement » His campaign suggested that he would skip the debate if Congress hadn't passed legislation addressing the crisis by then. Obama, however, said the debate in Oxford, Mississippi, should go forward. "It's my belief that this is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person will be the next president," the Democrat said in Clearwater, Florida. The University of Mississippi, the host of Friday's presidential debate, said it is going ahead with preparations for the event. Watch Obama say debate shouldn't be postponed » McCain's suspension of his campaign hours before Bush's address to the nation on the troubled state of the U.S. financial system, a problem for which Bush's administration has proposed having the Treasury Department buy up to $700 billion in firms' troubled assets -- mainly mortgage-backed securities -- whose values declined as the housing market imploded. The plan's goal is to stabilize the companies and prompt them to lend again. Watch Bush's address » While McCain and Obama jointly called for bipartisan cooperation on the economic crisis, in a separate statement Obama outlined some principles he said should guide the legislation and called on McCain to support them.

Seventh Guantanamo Prosecutor resigns over ethical issues
Guantanamo prosecutor quits The Army reservist was concerned about a lack of due process for war crimes defendant, defense attorneys say. He is charged with attempting to commit murder in violation of the law of war for allegedly throwing a grenade into a jeep transporting troops, injuring two soldiers and an interpreter. Vandeveld, an Army reservist, said in a four-page declaration filed with the court that "potentially exculpatory evidence has not been provided" to the defense. Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld quit the case -- and the Office of Military Commissions -- after growing increasingly concerned about the lack of due process afforded to Mohammed Jawad and his legal team, according to Michael J. Berrigan, deputy chief defense counsel for the commissions. GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA — Contending that the government had suppressed evidence that could help a young man facing life in prison, a prosecutor has quit the war crimes tribunals here, several military defense lawyers said Wednesday. His Pentagon-appointed defense attorney, Air Force Maj. David Frakt, also said that the prosecutor had quit in recent days over significant concerns about the case. "He was uncomfortable being a prosecutor under the conditions, and [his superiors] told him to do his job," Berrigan said, adding that Vandeveld then took his concerns to higher authorities but was rebuffed. Both defense lawyers said Vandeveld had spelled out his allegations in the sealed affidavit. Frakt said he had moved to call Vandeveld as a defense witness; the prosecutor had indicated he would testify about his ethical concerns and about how he wanted to offer Jawad a plea deal that would allow him to walk free in the near future.

VP candidate Palin accuses Obama of terrorist links
US Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin has accused the Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, of associating with terrorists. She said he had been "palling around" with an ex-member of US-based militant group Weather Underground, which opposed the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Mr Obama once served on a charity board with a member of the group, but he has denounced its activities. A Democratic spokesman accused the Republicans of gutter politics. "What's clear is that John McCain and Sarah Palin would rather spend their time tearing down Barack Obama than laying out a plan to build up our economy," Hari Sevugan said. Denunciation Speaking to supporters in Colorado and later in a Los Angeles suburb, Alaska Governor Palin said the time had come to take the gloves off. The White House candidates face their second debate on Tuesday Quoting a New York Times article, she attacked Senator Obama over his link to Bill Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground, which waged a violent campaign against the Vietnam War. Mrs Palin described Mr Obama as someone who saw the US "as being so imperfect... he is palling around with terrorists who would target their own country". Mr Obama served on a charity board several years ago with Mr Ayers, who is now a professor at the University of Illinois. The White House hopeful, who was a child when Weather Underground was active, has denounced Mr Ayers' radical past. Focus on healthcare The Alaska governor also said she wished the McCain campaign had not this week pulled out of the battleground state of Michigan, effectively conceding it to the Democrats.

Thai-Cambodian generals in talks after border clash kills two
The two sides have had troops and equipment in the area since July Generals from Thailand and Cambodia have been holding talks in an attempt to resolve a border dispute that led to a fatal exchange of fire on Wednesday. Reports say both sides have agreed to joint border patrols as a way to ease the tensions. But there are no reports of further progress and Thailand has also implied that Cambodian soldiers have been planting mines in the disputed area. At least two Cambodian troops died in the clash near the Preah Vihear temple. Two Cambodian soldiers were injured, along with seven Thai troops, in the skirmish, which lasted less than an hour. New conflict near ancient ruins In pictures: Thai-Cambodia strife Both countries claim the area around the temple, and despite several rounds of talks a settlement remains elusive. The issue of ownership is partly a nationalist one, but the area is also prized because the temple became a Unesco World Heritage site in June and the site could one day generate lucrative tourist revenues. The UN, US, EU and China have all called for restraint, and Indonesia is said to have offered to mediate in the border talks. Small step "We will introduce the joint patrol to avoid this kind of incident happening again," Lieutenant General Wiboonsak Neeparn, Thailand's north-eastern army commander, was quoted as saying after the five-hour meeting. But he also suggested "not much" progress had been made, pointing out "troops on both sides will stay where they are", a report said. Thailand has also implicitly accused Cambodia of planting further mines in the already heavily mined area, claiming a number of new Russian-made mines have been found buried in the ground and that two Thai soldiers had their legs blown off earlier this month. Meanwhile, there is confusion over the fate of 13 Thai soldiers Cambodia claimed it captured during Wednesday's confrontation.

Police fight police in Brazil protest
Advertisement By Gary Duffy BBC News, Sao Paulo Riot police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo have clashed with other police officers who are on strike. The confrontation happened when the striking officers tried to force their way past barriers to reach a building used by state governor Jose Serra. Tear gas and rubber bullets were used to keep back the demonstrators and 15 to 20 injuries have been reported. Mr Serra later said many protesters had not been police, but members of other unions and political groups. Heated exchanges The clashes happened in the Morumbi district of Sao Paulo as the police officers, who have been on strike for a month, tried to reach the building used by the governor. The strikers wanted to meet him in order to negotiate a 15% pay rise. In a statement, the authorities said the trouble began when strike leaders accepted a proposal to receive an official representative in the area where they were staging the protest. Live television picture showed pushing and shoving and some punches being thrown as the protesters pushed forward. In one incident, a marked police vehicle could be seen trying to force its way through a police cordon, and there were a number of heated exchanges. Hospitals nearby received a small number of people with slight injuries, including a senior officer who had been involved in the negotiations with the protesters. The striking officers are from the branch of the state police responsible for detective work and criminal investigations, while those trying to hold the demonstrators back are from the military police, whose role is broadly to maintain law and order on the streets.

China's Premier recognises government responsibility in milk incident
The contaminated milk killed four babies and left tens of thousands sick Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has said the government is partly responsible for the tainted milk scandal which has left thousands of children sick. In a rare interview with Science magazine, Mr Wen said the government felt "great sorrow" about the crisis, which also killed four children. He said while the problems were with a private company, the government had not properly supervised the dairy industry. Milk powder was contaminated with the industrial chemical, melamine. Suppliers are believed to have added the banned chemical, normally used in plastics, to watered-down milk in order to make it appear higher in protein. Firms collapse "We feel great sorrow about the milk incident," Mr Wen was quoted as saying in the magazine, which is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. "We feel that although problems occurred at the company, the government also has a responsibility." Mr Wen said that clear standards and testing requirements were needed in all the steps of making milk - the production of raw milk, collection, transportation, processing and making formula. "I once again solemnly emphasize that it is absolutely impermissible to sacrifice people's lives and health in exchange for temporary economic development," he said. BEIJING (AP) — In a rare interview with a foreign publication, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China said that the government was partly responsible for the tainted milk scandal that has been blamed in the deaths of at least three babies and has shaken consumer confidence.

Israeli coalition talks degenerate after Shas departure
“I do not see this as the end of the story with Shas,” said Otniel Schneller, a Parliament member from Ms. Livni’s Kadima Party, in a telephone interview, making a point echoed by others. “I think we can still find a creative formula for Jerusalem and bring them back.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Meanwhile Meretz, on the left, has been in talks all week with Ms. Livni. “We decided that we are in the government and now are setting about writing the agreement,” Avshalom Vilan, a Parliament member from Meretz, said by telephone. “I believe Livni will try to build a government with what she has rather than go to early elections.” So far, Ms. Livni has a clear deal only with the Labor Party, led by Defense Minister Ehud Barak. Mr. Barak wants as broad a government as possible because he worries that a narrow one will not last and will lead inevitably to early elections in which the opposition Likud Party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, is ahead in the polls. An associate of Mr. Barak said he would be willing to move forward if both Meretz and Yahadut Hatorah signed on, bringing her governing majority to 66.

Asian stock markets slide; Nikkei at lowest level since '82
Nikkei dives to 26-year low Posted Japan's main stock index hit its lowest level in 26 years in early trading today as the global economic crisis continued to batter markets. The Nikkei index has tracked share prices in Japan since the 1940s and heavy falls last week saw it touch its lowest in five years. Shortly after opening this morning the index plunged below 7,500, a level not seen since 1982. Japanese companies are being marked down because of the impact a slowing global economy will have on their earnings, and also the rapidly strengthening yen, which has reached a 13-year-high against the US dollar. The Nikkei's all-time high was set in 1989, when it reached 38,915 points - more than four times its current level - at the height of Japan's so-called "bubble economy". Topics: international-financial-crisis, business-economics-and-finance, markets, currency, futures, stockmarket, japan A staff at Tokyo Stock Exchange looks at a stock quotation board as he works at the bourse in Tokyo October 27, 2008. REUTERS/Issei Kato A man walks past the sign of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Tokyo October 27, 2008. Gains in the yen came despite a G7 warning about excessive volatility in the currency -- a warning that the Japanese government had requested. Pledges from Prime Minister Taro Aso for more steps to ease the strains on banks and strengthen rules on short-selling did little to ease the panic in the markets. "We need something that surprises the market in a good way, perhaps something like the government intervening to sell yen," said Masayoshi Okamoto, head of dealing at Jujiya Securities. "If we don't have something like this, today's low -- the 26-year low -- won't be significant at all." In its fourth straight negative day, the Nikkei .N225 shed 486.18 points to close at 7,162.90, its lowest close since October 1982 -- when Ronald Reagan was the U.S. President and Sony Corp released the CD player.

Syria files UN Security Council complaint after US raid
Syria hardened its stance against the U.S. on Wednesday, threatening to cut off cooperation on Iraqi border security while demanding America apologize and promise not to repeat a deadly cross-border raid into its territory. The U.S. Embassy announced that it was closing its doors on Thursday "due to security concerns." The statement on its Web site did not say for how long. The closure announcement came ahead of a government-sanctioned mass demonstration set for Thursday in Damascus to protest Sunday's raid that Syria said killed eight people in the eastern border community of Abu Kamal. The Syrian government already had ordered the closure of an American school and cultural center. That and a U.S. embassy warning to be vigilant has raised concerns among Americans living in Damascus. According to a State Department official, America's senior diplomat in the country, Maura Connolly, was officially notified of Syria's request that the American Cultural Center be closed effective immediately. "We are looking at how to respond," State Department deputy spokesman Robert Wood said, adding that in the meantime: "we expect the Syrian government to provide adequate security for the buildings in which the American Cultural Center and Damascus Community School are housed." Earlier Wednesday, Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Fayssal Mekdad demanded an investigation into Sunday's raid and assurances that Iraqi territory not be used for attacking Syria. "We ask of them (Iraqis) and the Americans to investigate and provide us with the background for such a criminal, terrorist act against an independent state ... (and) make an official apology for this aggression and pledge not to repeat it," Mekdad told The Associated Press. "What is required of the American government is to confess to this aggression and not be cowardly," he said, adding that the U.S. should also compensate Syria.

David Tennant announces exit from Doctor Who
David Tennant, one of the most popular time lords ever to step into the Tardis, said last night he would leave the BBC's Doctor Who series at the end of next year. Tennant's decision will bring to an end his four-year tenure as the 10th Doctor, which has seen him win over a new generation of fans and amass an enviable collection of television awards. Tennant, 37, made his announcement by videolink at last night's National Television awards, where he won an outstanding drama performance award and Doctor Who also won most popular drama. The BBC said he would play the Doctor in the four specials due to screen as part of the 2009 series before a new time lord "regenerates" for the 2010 series. Tennant will also star in the Doctor Who Christmas special this year. The Scottish actor first expressed interest in fulfilling his childhood dream to play the Doctor for the 2005 series, but the role went to Christopher Eccleston. But the following season, the BBC confirmed Tennant would take up the battle against the Zygons and Daleks. Tennant's charisma as the Doctor has elevated his status to one of the most popular actors on British television, with the actor picking up the National Television award's most popular actor award last year and best actor in 2006. On announcing his departure last night, Tennant said: "It would be very easy to cling on to the Tardis console forever and I fear that if I don't take a deep breath and make the decision to move on now, then I simply never will. You would be prising the Tardis key out of my cold dead hand." It would be very easy to cling on to the Tardis console forever and I fear that if I don't take a deep breath and make the decision to move on now, then I simply never will...

Christian Science Monitor to cease daily print publication
Its readers are a snapshot of a bygone age – retired diplomats, missionaries and maiden aunts – but The Christian Science Monitor has plans that many a forward-looking editor would blanche to think of. In April, the US daily will ditch its paper edition and channel resources into its website, with a daily email bulletin and weekly 44-page magazine for subscribers. Moving from print to online is hardly a novelty: for many struggling publications it's the elephant in the newsroom as circulation dwindles and print costs soar. But the Monitor will be the first nationally circulated daily paper to surrender its print version altogether and, according to its editor, John Yemma, it will not be the last. "We've always been burdened by the unwieldy mechanism of publishing and distributing a daily paper simultaneously across America," he says. So in a sense, we have had to wait for the internet to be born." Later this month, The Christian Science Monitor marks its 100th birthday, but you would be forgiven for never having heard of it. Founded in 1908 by Mary Baker Eddy (right), the then 87-year-old founder of the Christian Science Movement, the paper was a high-minded response to the "yellow", or sensationalist journalism of the day. Mary Eddy was "aghast" as the quality of journalism, says Yemma, and with the Monitor she tapped into a surge of Puritanism which, with the help of church funds, allowed the paper to flourish. As a news-gathering organ, the paper is blessed with enviable resources, including an astonishing 95 full-time editorial staff, with correspondents all over America and in seven bureaux worldwide.

"She was the cornerstone of our family, and a woman of extraordinary accomplishment, strength, and humility. "She was the person who encouraged and allowed us to take chances. "She was proud of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren and left this world with the knowledge that her impact on all of us was meaningful and enduring. Our debt to her is beyond measure."

US voters go to the polls
An unprecedented outpouring of voters translated into waits of several hours yesterday at polling sites from Arizona to southeastern Virginia, amid sporadic reports around the country of problematic voting machines, faulty registration lists, and deceptive text messages and other high-tech efforts to deter young people and minorities from casting ballots. Nationally, the quadrennial ritual of selecting a president produced few problems widespread enough to cast the outcome in doubt, according to election observers, state election officials and the political parties. In fact, the record-shattering turnouts transformed the protracted waits in some places into de facto street parties, with citizens snapping photos with their cellphones as they waited their turn at democracy's most basic task. In Santa Monica, Calif., crowds in line at 7 a.m. for the polls to open at City Hall broke into cheers and songs as the sun rose. The day had its share of snags. One Kansas City, Mo., ward received scrambled registration lists, prompting huge backups, for two hours until the rolls were straightened out, as poll workers verified eligibility. A suspicious white powder closed one Rhode Island polling station for four hours until officials determined the substance to be soap. Polls in at least a few places remained open later than scheduled to accommodate the throngs or for other reasons. They included Seattle and Tacoma, Wash., and a few precincts close to universities in Florida and Virginia. Last-minute lawsuits challenging election procedures were lodged yesterday in Philadelphia, Indianapolis, New Hampshire and Ohio. But election law specialists said potential problems at the polls had been averted by nearly a dozen lawsuits nationwide filed in recent weeks, in which federal and state courts upheld the eligibility of hundreds of thousands of voters. "From the national view, we just haven't had the kind of breakdowns people feared," said Doug Chapin, director of Electionline.org, a nonpartisan project that monitors election administration. The logistics of voting have emerged as a large-scale partisan and legal issue since the disputed 2000 election, in which George W. Bush's victory hinged on court rulings about the handling of ballots in Florida.

Mr Brown has been keen to align himself to the Democrat by claiming he shares the same progressive values as Mr Obama. While campaigning, Barack Obama said he could hold direct talks with Tehran[AFP] While campaigning, Barack Obama said he could hold direct talks with Tehran[AFP] Diplomatic ties between the two countries have largely been cut since the revolution removed the country's US-backed leader from power. During campaigning, Obama said if elected, he would consider holding direct talks with Iranian leaders over the country's nuclear programme, which Western powers have alleged is for developing weapons. 'War-oriented' policies Ahmadinejad said in the statement published by Irna, Iran's official news agency, that he hoped Obama would put an end to the United States' "war-oriented" policies. "Other nations expect war-oriented policies, occupation, bullying ... and imposing discriminatory policies on them to be replaced by those advocating respect ... and non-interference in other countries' state matters," he said. Obama has said he would be willing to toughen sanctions on Iran, and like George Bush, the current president, would not rule out military action against Tehran. Obama has said direct talks could be necessary to give those decisions greater credibility and criticised the outgoing administration for not pushing for more diplomacy and engagement with Tehran. Speaking to Mehr news agency, he said that "through the lifting of the past government's cruel sanctions against Iran, Barack Obama can demonstrate his goodwill to the Iranian people". Israeli caution The UN has imposed three rounds of sanctions since 2006, in addition to bilateral measures by Washington, over Iran's refusal to halt uranium enrichment - a process that can have either civilian or military uses. Tzipi Livni, Israel's foreign minister and leader of the ruling Kadima party, warned Obama against rushing into any engagement with Tehran.

Gay marriage banned in three states; other ballot measures decided
As the world focused on the presidential election, voters in a number of US states decided questions on a hot-button social and cultural issues. Voters in Colorado and South Dakota defeated ballot measures aimed at restricting abortion, while Massachusetts and Michigan approved measures to slacken marijuana laws. In South Dakota, voters rejected a ballot proposition that would have outlawed abortion except in cases of rape, incest and serious health threat to the mother. Had it passed, the law would likely have provoked a constitutional challenge, setting up an fight in the US supreme court over a woman's right to choose abortion. In 2006 South Dakotans rejected a stricter abortion ban that did not include the exceptions for rape and incest. It doesn't mention abortion, but would force legislators and courts to confront which legal rights to extend to foetuses – and whether the amendment effectively bans abortion. Michigan became the 13th state to legalise marijuana for medical use, while Massachusetts decriminalised possession of one ounce or less of the substance, making the offence punishable with a citation and a $100 fine. "Tonight's results represent a sea change," said Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, which backed the Massachusetts and Michigan ballot proposals. In Arkansas, voters approved a measure on the ballot to bar unmarried couples from adopting or taking in foster children.

India's flag lands on Moon
India sends probe on to the Moon The lunar surface viewed by the Moon Impact Probe on its descent India's first unmanned lunar spacecraft, Chandrayaan 1, has sent a probe on to the surface of the Moon. The probe, painted with the Indian flag, crashed into the Moon's surface at 2034 (1504 GMT), the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said. During its controlled plunge, it took readings including measurements of the composition of the Moon's atmosphere. The mission is regarded as a major step for India as it seeks to keep pace with other space-faring nations in Asia. The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says the success of the mission has been hailed in India where many see it as another sign of the country's emergence as a global power.

Veteran MP Murray McCully is named foreign affairs minister and ex-diplomat Tim Groser will cover trade. Of the 20-member cabinet, six are women, one is a first-time MP and six have less than three years' experience. A second surprise was the award of the big-budget social development portfolio to Paula Bennett, who only became an MP in 2005. The eight extra ministers outside cabinet include five from three allied minor parties. Because the ministers from the Act party, United Future and Maori Party will not sit in cabinet, they will be allowed to oppose government policy outside their own portfolios. Mr Key, a multi-millionaire former investment banker, has worked fast to form a government ahead of being signed in on Wednesday so he can leave for a summit in Peru the next day. Economic challenge "The National-led government takes office at a challenging time for the country," Mr Key said after announcing his line-up. "The growth outlook is weak, and international and domestic difficulties abound. "This government will concentrate on boosting economic growth because that is what will lead us out of these challenging times," he said.

Multiple extremist attacks in Mumbai, India kill dozens, injure hundreds
NEW DELHI An organisation calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen has claimed it was behind attacks in India's financial capital Mumbai that have left at least 80 people dead, television channels reported on Thursday. The previously unknown or little known group sent an email to news organisations claiming responsibility. India has suffered a wave of bomb attacks in recent years. Most have been blamed on Islamist militants, although police have also arrested suspected Hindu extremists thought to be behind some of the attacks. Employees and guests of the Taj Mahal Palace hotel are rescued by fire crews Gunmen have carried out a series of co-ordinated attacks across the Indian city of Mumbai (Bombay), killing 101 people and injuring 287 more. At least seven high-profile locations were hit in India's financial capital, including two luxury hotels where dozens of hostages are being held. Gunmen are also said to be holding people captive in an office block. Police say four suspected terrorists have been killed and nine arrested. Attacks leave India reeling Witnesses tell of violence In pictures: Mumbai attacks As day broke in Mumbai, the situation on the ground was still confused with reports of gunfire and explosions at between seven and 16 locations. The city's main commuter train station, a hospital, a restaurant and two hotels - locations used by foreigners as well as local businessmen and leaders - were among those places caught up in the violence. Commandos have surrounded the two hotels, the Taj Mahal Palace and the Oberoi Trident, where it is believed that the armed men are holding dozens of hostages. In other developments: • Fire crews evacuate people from the upper floors of the Taj Mahal Palace, where police say a grenade attack caused a blaze • The head of Mumbai's anti-terrorism unit and two other senior officers are among those killed, officials say • The White House holds a meeting of top intelligence and counter-terrorism officials, and pledges to help the Indian government • Trading on India's Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange markets will remain closed on Thursday, officials say.

India's Home Minister quits as first political fallout of Mumbai attacks
Chidambaram takes over as home minister Text Size: |  63-year-old Chidambaram, who has had a stint as minister of internal security under the late Rajiv Gandhi in late 1980s, was shifted to the home ministry after amidst demands for the ouster of Patil, who had come under severe attack for his handling of internal security matters. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, himself an economist of repute, will hold the finance portfolio at a time when the country is suffering from the ripple effects of the global recession. Singh had held the finance portfolio for five years under the late P V Narasimha Rao. A Rashtrapati Bhawan communique announced the appointment of Chidambaram as home minister after acceptance of Patil's resignation. It said the Prime Minister will hold the additional charge of finance. Indications that Chidambaram would be given the new responsibility came when he was called as a special invitee to the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday night and he met the Prime Minister on Sunday morning to discuss the situation arising out of the Mumbai terror attacks. After recommending Patil's resignation to President Pratibha Patil, who is away in Indonesia, the Prime Minister spoke to Chidambaram formally conveying the decision to give him the new assignment. The appointment also came hours before the start of the all-party meeting convened by the Prime Minister to discuss the Mumbai attacks and evolve a consensus on how to combat terror. Shortly after his appointment, home secretary Madhukar Gupta gave him a briefing on the ministry, especially in the current context of tackling the menace of terrorism. A Harvard-educated MBA and an eminent lawyer, Chidambaram brings to home ministry his vast experience as a political administrator he had gained during his various stints in the government at the Centre. Later, he held the finance portfolio in the United Front government under H D Deve Gowda and I K Gujral, a ministry he got again when the Congress-led UPA came to power in 2004.

Hillary Clinton nominated as US Secretary of State
Enlarge By Charles Dharapak, AP Barack Obama leaves a news conference in Chicago with Secretary of State-designate Hillary Rodham Clinton. They are followed by members of his newly-named security team, from top left: Eric Holder, Janet Napolitano, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Vice President-elect Joe Biden and James Jones. CHICAGO  President-elect Barack Obama promised "a new dawn of American leadership" in the world Monday from a diverse national security team that has not always agreed with him. The team, led by his former campaign rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and President Bush's Defense secretary, Robert Gates, is charged with reinvigorating diplomacy, using power pragmatically and renewing what Clinton called "America's standing in the world as a force for positive change." HOLDER: Historic pick for A.G. faces challenges NAPOLITANO: Tasked with Homeland Security overhaul JONES: Not regarded as 'political general' SUSAN RICE: U.N. ambassador to mend fences Also nominated for top jobs were Eric Holder as attorney general, Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano as Homeland Security secretary, retired Marine general Jim Jones as national security adviser and Susan Rice as U.N. ambassador. "America's security is not a partisan issue — witness the team," Vice President-elect Joe Biden said. "I'm a strong believer in strong personalities and strong opinions. "I'm going to be welcoming a vigorous debate inside the White House." Clinton differed with Obama during the campaign on when to use force and when to use diplomacy. Michael O'Hanlon, senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said keeping Gates is "a fairly clear indication from Obama that he's going to be flexible on Iraq." Foreign policy experts said the group will differ more in style than substance from the moderate team, led by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, that Bush installed halfway through his presidency.

Passengers rescued from stranded Antarctic cruise ship
SANTIAGO, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- The 33 crew members and 89 passengers abroad the cruise liner Ushuaia stranded in Antarctica were rescued Friday by the Chilean navy. The rescuers used the boats on the cruise ship to take all the passengers and crew members to the Chilean navy vessel Aquiles. A cruise ship with 33 crew members and 89 passengers is stranded in Antarctica on Dec. 4. (Xinhua/AFP Photo) Photo Gallery>>> "The Aquiles is sailing with all the passengers to the Chilean Crei Base," which is located 350 km from the accident place, the Argentine navy said in a statement. Aquiles is expected to arrive the Chilean base early Saturday, where the passengers will be taken by a Hercules C-130 plane of the Argentine Air Force to the Port of Ushuaia in southern Argentina. The cruise ship has a Panamanian flag but is owned by an Argentine company. It sent out alarms midday Thursday after it started leaking fuel and taking in water. A rock damaged the hull as the Ushuaia passed through the Gerlache Strait, about 300 km from Argentine base Maramnio and 1,300 km south of Ushuaia. The cruise ship, built in 1970, operates from the Port of Ushuaia, transporting passengers to Antarctica and islands in the waters of the South Atlantic. BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- All 122 people aboard a cruise ship stranded off Antarctica have been evacuated and are "in perfect health," the Chilean navy said Friday.

Irish government orders recall of all pork products
Irish pork products on sale since September 2008 were recalled last night following fears that pigs had been given feed contaminated by harmful toxins. The Food Standards Agency of Ireland revealed pork products on several farms across the country were found to have up to 200 times more dioxins than the accepted safe limit. The recall affects products sold across Ireland and the UK since 1 September. Consumers and retailers are now being encouraged to destroy all Irish pork and bacon products bought since that date. The FSAI admitted suspicions over contamination were first raised last Monday, as a result of routine testing of pigs, when restrictions were placed on some pig farms. But the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was only confirmed yesterday by tests from a UK laboratory. The contamination has been traced back to an ingredient in an animal feed from one supplier, which was used at 47 different farms. They include 37 beef farms, but it has not yet been necessary to withdraw the beef products. Chronic long-term exposure to the dioxin can have serious health effects, including causing cancers, but the FSAI said the recall will ensure consumers only had minimum exposure to it. The UK's Food Standards Agency has said pork from the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland should not be eaten.

Alleged 9-11 conspirators will confess and plead guilty
The Nation Chaos at Guantanamo tribunal Five alleged Sept. 11 plotters offer to plead guilty, then three decline. For The Record Los Angeles Times Wednesday, December 10, 2008 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches; 34 words Type of Material: Correction Guantanamo Bay: An article in Tuesday's Section A about the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, incorrectly gave the name of the Uniform Code of Military Justice as the Uniformed Code of Military Justice. But given the chance to enter pleas later in the day, Mohammed and two others declined because they were concerned that pleading guilty without a military jury present might make them ineligible for a sentence of death. Mohammed mocked the tribunal for its bureaucracy and dismissed his Navy lawyer for having served in Iraq, where U.S. troops have been "killing our brothers and sisters." Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and his alleged co-conspirators renewed their vows to die as martyrs at the hands of the U.S. military, offering to plead guilty and dispense with pretrial matters to hasten their execution. GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA — Five men accused of plotting the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks turned what might have been their last appearance before a Guantanamo court Monday into a tribute to Osama bin Laden and a call on fellow holy warriors to strike the U.S. with weapons of mass destruction. The judge newly assigned to the Sept. 11 defendants' case, Army Col. Stephen R. Henley, asked government lawyers whether rules for the military commissions, as the trials are known, allowed him to find the men guilty. The law enacted by Congress two years ago calls for a military jury of at least 12 members to sentence a defendant to death. No jury has been assembled because the court had expected to address only pretrial issues this week. The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Army Col. Lawrence J. Morris, said the confusion about the death penalty arose because the Uniformed Code of Military Justice that governs military courts-martial prohibits guilty pleas in capital cases to protect defendants from being railroaded to execution. Henley also declined to allow two of the men, Ramzi Binalshibh and Mustafa Ahmed Hawsawi, to represent themselves until the court reviews their psychiatric evaluations. Upon learning that they wouldn't be allowed to enter their pleas together, the five said they would wait until they could stick with their strategy of united action. In a dramatic finale to a day in court that was watched by nine people who lost loved ones in the attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon, Binalshibh proclaimed the defendants' allegiance to Bin Laden and his international jihad against the U.S. "I want to send my greetings to Osama bin Laden, and I want to reaffirm my allegiance.

23 Australians arrested in global child porn network
More child porn arrests expected: AFP Updated Australian Federal Police (AFP) say they expect to make more arrests in relation to an alleged internet child sex abuse network. Police have charged 22 men from three states after a 12-month investigation, and the AFP has seized more than 500,000 images and 15,000 videos as part of their inquiries. Twenty-eight search warrants were carried out and the suspects include seven people from Victoria; nine from New South Wales; and five from Queensland. One of those arrested was a 74-year-old retired Victorian Queen's Counsel from Newham, several child care workers and a police officer. "Over 200 suspects have been identified across a number of countries, over 70 countries and I think on any scale that's a good result," he said. "We are finding with these type of images that it is very difficult for law enforcement to track them down but we are receiving information that they are based primarily in eastern Europe and North and South America." "We, through our international liaison network, received information from the Brazilian police that there was a large amount of males throughout the world in over 70 countries involved in the trading of this sort of information in a peer to peer network," he said. "They passed the information on to the AFP and we then conducted significant inquiries with internet service providers and then moved forward."

Human remains in mass grave confirm Argentina secret death camp
By Daniel Schweimler BBC News, Buenos Aires The remains of hundreds of people killed during Argentina's military dictatorship about 30 years ago have been found in a pit. The thousands of bone fragments were found at a former detention centre. Investigators say the discovery proves that the authorities tortured, killed and burned the bodies of their political opponents. Human rights groups and survivors have made such allegations but the military deny them. The official figures say that 13,000 people were killed under military rule in Argentina in the late 1970s and and early 1980s. 'The disappeared' But many of the bodies have never been found and the authorities eliminated all record of their grisly actions. These victims became known as "the disappeared". But the families and forensic investigators have never given up their search for truth and justice. And this find - 10,000 human bone fragments at a former detention centre in the city of La Plata, just south of Buenos Aires - they say confirms what they have always said. But the trials resumed a couple of years ago and a small number of minor officials have been prosecuted and sent to jail.

Thai opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva elected as new Prime Minister
Advertisement Thailand's opposition leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva, has been confirmed as the country's new prime minister after winning a special vote in parliament. The speaker of the lower house, Chai Chidchob, said the Democrat Party leader had beaten former police chief Pracha Promnok by 235 votes to 198. Mr Abhisit will become Thailand's fifth leader in a little over two years. The previous prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, was forced to resign after a court ruling earlier this month. ABHISIT VEJJAJIVA Born in Britain, educated at Eton and Oxford Entered parliament in 1992 as one of its youngest members Party leader since 2005 Opposed military coup that overthrew Thaksin Shinawatra Profile: Abhisit Vejjajiva Mountain to climb for new PM Send us your comments The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says Mr Abhisit will start his term in office confronting some formidable challenges. The 44-year-old British-born politician needs to restore battered economic confidence, cool the emotional political climate, and impose his authority on a cabinet drawn up as a result of days of bargaining with his coalition partners, our correspondent says. 'Silent coup' After the speaker of parliament had gone round and asked each of the 436 MPs to state the choice, he announced that Mr Abhisit had won and that the Democrats would be given their first chance to govern for eight years. "Abhisit gained more than half of the vote, therefore I declare that Abhisit has been elected the new prime minister," Mr Chai said. Advertisement However, correspondents say the new coalition may only last a few weeks, as by-elections will be held on 11 January to fill 29 seats held by Thaksin supporters barred from politics by the court ruling. There are also questions about the nature of the behind-the-scenes bargaining needed to persuade Thaksin loyalists to switch sides, with lucrative cabinet posts and, allegedly, large sums of cash being offered by both sides. Outside the parliament, about 200 supporters of the ousted government reacted furiously to what they called a "silent coup", hurling barricades at the gates and stopping MPs from leaving.

Ferry sinks in northern Philippines, 28 dead
The wooden-hulled ferry, Maejan, was approaching its destination in Aparri town in Cagayan province after an eight-hour journey from Calayan islands in the Luzon Strait when it overturned near the mouth of the Cagayan River on Sunday evening, said Senior Inspector Alex de los Santos. He said passengers jumped into the cold water after strong waves broke the ferry's bamboo outrigger, causing it to bob wildly. "They panicked and grabbed anything like water containers that will keep them afloat then jumped off the boat," de los Santos told The Associated Press by telephone. He said most of the 46 survivors swam to shore in Aparri, about half a mile (kilometer) away, where police and villagers found them shivering close to midnight. The dead — including a 1-year-old boy and a town councillor — were taken to funeral parlors, where relatives gathered to identify them. Most probably his parents perished with him." Coast guard chief Vice Adm. Wilfredo Tamayo said criminal charges will be filed against the owner and surviving crew members of the 28-ton Maejan, which was authorized to carry only 50 people. Hours before the ferry capsized, three children fell into the sea as the vessel was lashed by huge waves, Calayan Mayor Joseph Llopis said. Two of the children were plucked alive, but it was not clear if they survived the final capsizing, said Llopis, who lost 10 of his relatives in the disaster. The accident was especially tragic because many of the passengers from his town of 17,000 people were traveling to Aparri to buy food and other goods ahead of Christmas, Llopis said.

Cleveland, Ohio clinic performs US's first face transplant
Surgeons discuss landmark face transplant In a Wednesday news conference, the Cleveland Clinic doctors who conducted the world's most extensive facial transplant described the 22-hour surgery they said took place at the clinic within the last two weeks. The patient is doing well, they said. Then she headed to the hospital to give a woman who had no upper jaw, nose, cheeks or lower eyelids -- who was unable to eat, talk, smile, smell or breathe on her own -- a new face. "We have a donor," she told Dr. Frank Papay, the chief of dermatology and plastic surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, late one night. Dr. Maria Siemionow had been preparing for 20 years to make the phone call. It was the first facial transplant to be done in the U.S. and the fourth in the world. At the patient's request, the clinic did not release her name, age or details about what caused her disfigurement -- only that it was severe. "It became very difficult for her just to go outside of her house." The day after Siemionow's phone call unfolded like the countdown to a rocket launch, Papay said. One group began removing the donor's facial skin; all of the muscles in the mid-face; the upper lip; all of the nose; most of the sinuses around the nose; the upper jaw, including some teeth; and the facial nerve.

Hamas ends truce with Israel
The six-month truce between Hamas and Israel ended yesterday with the militant Islamists who rule Gaza declaring the agreement dead, 24 hours before it was due to officially expire. The declaration followed another day of escalating violence, beginning with an Israeli air raid on Gaza, which Hamas has controlled for the past 18 months. Hamas responded to Israel's attack, which destroyed a weapons store and a rocket factory, by firing eight rockets and five mortars at Israel's southern towns. "The calm, which was reached with Egyptian sponsorship on 19 June and expires on 19 December, is finished because the enemy did not abide by its obligations," said Ayman Taha, who represented Hamas in talks with other Palestinian factions. The truce was due to end today but has been unravelling ever since Israel crossed into Gaza, killed six Hamas fighters and destroyed a tunnel on 4 November. So far this week Hamas has fired around 50 rockets. On Wednesday one struck a parking lot near a supermarket in Sderot, the Israeli town that borders Gaza's northern perimeter and bears the brunt of Palestinian missile attacks. As the fighting escalated, Israel tightened its blockade, forcing the UN Relief and Works Agency, which feeds 750,000 Palestinian refugees in the coastal territory, to suspend food deliveries yesterday. The eruption of violence follows five months of relative calm in which each side seemed prepared to turn a blind eye to the other's transgressions: Israel maintained its crippling blockade on Gaza and Palestinian militants continued firing a small number of missiles into neighbouring Israeli townships. For Hamas, the truce allowed it to redeploy its forces from fighting Israel to cracking down on rival militias. For Israel, the truce not only gave the residents of towns such as Sderot a reprieve, it deflated the hard right's push for a full-scale invasion into Gaza.

Four UK retailers call in administrators during the week of Christmas
It has been a tough few months for well-known retailers UK menswear retailer The Officers Club has gone into administration and 32 of its 150 shops will shut immediately, while the remainder have been sold. The retailer was put up for sale by administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers as it fell victim to the downturn. They said the 118 stores had been sold to TimeC 1215 limited, which is backed by David Charlton, chief executive of The Officers Club. It became one of the biggest retail companies in the UK with flagship stores in London's Oxford Street and north-east England. 'Employment protected' "We are very pleased to be able to secure this deal and protect the employment of over 900 people in the stores and head office," said Mr Charlton. Insolvency experts are warning that more than 10 national or regional retail chains risk going bust next month. Retailers are vulnerable in January because they generally have more cash and less stock than at any other time of the year, so if creditors are going to force them into administration it is the best time to do so. It has already been a tough few months for well-known retailers, with MFI already having closed down and Woolworths due to shut its shops in January.

Nine dead after armed Santa Claus opens fire in LA suburb
The Ortega home, a tidy, one-story structure at the end of a Covina cul-de-sac, had been at the center of so many family events: pizza nights, poker parties and an annual Christmas Eve party where the large, close-knit family gathered to celebrate the holidays. On Saturday, it was a place for grief. Leaning toward the yellow police tape that encircled the ruins of the home, family members wrapped their arms around each other. They gestured at items that had been salvaged and laid on the front lawn: a file cabinet, charred photo albums and singed pictures. FOR THE RECORD: Holiday massacre: An article in Sunday's California section said that the home of the Ortega family, nine of whom were believed slain by Bruce Jeffrey Pardo on Christmas Eve, was a single-story structure. —  Three days earlier, the ex-husband of one of the Ortegas arrived at their holiday celebration dressed as Santa Claus and armed with four semiautomatic weapons and an incendiary device. When he left, nine family members were dead and the house was engulfed in flames.

Mr Akufo-Addo congratulated Mr Atta Mills, but a spokesman said the party would challenge the result in court. The run-off, with the last vote held in Tain constituency, was closely watched as Ghana remains a rare example of a functioning democracy in West Africa.

Belgian king swears in PM Van Rompuy, cabinet
BRUSSELS Dec 31 New Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy urged parliament on Wednesday to pass bills to revive an economy heading into recession and to resolve a political dispute that threatens to pull the country apart. "The year that ends today has been marked by the most serious global financial crisis since the 1930s," he said in a declaration before a vote of confidence due on Friday. "Domestically it has been a year of uncertainty, partly due to political moments of crisis and the consequences of the financial crisis," he continued in the Belgian equivalent of a state of the union address. Van Rompuy, 61, became Belgium's third premier in a year on Tuesday, succeeding Yves Leterme whose government collapsed on Dec. 19 over the stalled bailout of stricken bank Fortis FOR.BR and asset sale to France's BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA). Belgium is expected to have entered a recession in the fourth quarter, faces a lingering bank crisis and is beset by a dispute over devolution that has seen it lurch from one political crisis to another since the June 2007 election. Leterme's government proposed earlier this month pumping 2 billion euros ($2.84 billion) into the economy next year, part of a 200 billion euro EU-wide stimulus package. "The previous government proposed such a plan. It must be enacted as soon as possible," Van Rompuy told lawmakers. "It is clear that in the coming weeks and months the government will take new initiatives to cope with the challenges that the crisis poses for the economy and employment." Van Rompuy also pressed bickering parties to settle a dispute over whether the regions should have greater autonomy. The prime minister first wants results from a committee looking into the thorny issue of electoral boundaries around Brussels and demanded changes implemented from next summer.

New Year fire kills at least 59, injures 212 more at Bangkok pub
Advertisement Police are investigating the cause of a fire in a Bangkok nightclub that killed 59 people, amid reports that fireworks were to blame. More than 200 people, including at least four Britons, were injured in the fire at the Santika club. Survivors have accused the venue of ignoring basic safety rules. Customers were reportedly allowed to detonate firecrackers inside the club, which lacked a fire exit and had bars on the windows. The police say there are no grounds yet for charging the owners of the club, but an investigation into the causes of the fire will be completed within two to three weeks. Safety concerns Only a full investigation can give a definitive answer as to whether the Santika was unsafe, the BBC's Jonathan Head reports from Thailand. But already there is enough circumstantial evidence from the accounts of survivors to conclude that the club probably failed to meet the most basic safety standards, he says. The management allowed fireworks to be lit inside a building packed with up to 1,000 revellers. Material that ignited in the ceiling - possibly soundproofing - flared into an inferno in just a few minutes and produced toxic fumes which killed many of the victims. There was no emergency lighting, so people had to find their way out in pitch darkness. The venue was not even registered as a nightclub - a situation which our correspondent says is not uncommon in Thailand.

Sri Lanka Army captures Tamil Tiger's capital of Kilinochchi
COLOMBO Sri Lankan jets and attack helicopters bombed Tamil Tiger positions in the north of the island on Saturday, the military said, a day after ground forces seized the rebels' de facto capital Kilinochchi. The military is now targeting the port town of Mullaitivu and other rebel strongholds in the north, as it seeks to deliver a knockout blow to end the island's 25-year separatist war in which more than 70,000 people have been killed. At least three people were injured and several vehicles damaged in an explosion on Saturday in the commercial quarter of Colombo, the second in the capital in two days. Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara blamed rebels for the attack which he said was an attempt to scare people or to show that Colombo was not secure. "A small IED (Improvised Explosive Device) fixed underneath of a van exploded and three people injured," Nanayakkara said. There has been no direct comment from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on the fall of Kilinochchi, long the centre of the rebels fight for an independent homeland for the Tamil minority. "Fighter Jets raided a Sea Tiger base in Mullaitivu while the MI-24 helicopters attacked rebel positions in and around Mullaitivu in support of ground troops," Air Force spokesman Wing Commander Janaka Nanayakkara said. Troops fought their way into Kilinochchi, deep in the north, on Friday in one of the biggest blows for the rebels in years. Details of casualties from the fighting have not yet emerged and a pro-rebel web site www.tamilnet.com said the Tigers had moved their headquarters further northeast before the town fell. "The Sri Lanka Army (SLA) has entered a virtual ghost town," the website said. Nanayakkara said troops were carrying out search and recovery operations in Kilinochchi town on Saturday. Defence Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said the troops were 2 km from Elephant Pass, a key rebel position in the neck of the northern Jaffna peninsula, and 6 km from Mullaitivu town, and that troops would capture them soon.

Mufid Saleh Walweel, 22, was shot in the head in the West Bank city of Qalqilya during a protest against Israel's military operation in the Gaza Strip, they said. There were also protests in Turkey, where organisers claimed 700,000 people had turned out for an anti-Israeli demonstration. Protesters called on Turkey, Israel's only Muslim ally, to re-evaluate ties with the Jewish state if it does not halt its incursion in the Gaza Strip. In Greece, demonstrators set fire to banks, threw rocks and fired flares at police in the capital Athens. Russia on Sunday said it was "extremely concerned" by Israel's land operation in Gaza and said it was sending a special envoy to the region to help bring about a ceasefire by both sides. Thousands of demonstrators in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, denounced Israel as a "terrorist" force and called on the government to send troops to fight Israeli forces. Iranian warning Iran, which has seen angry protests since the Israeli raids began last week, also added its voice.

China targets Google, Baidu and Internet portals over porn
People use computers at an Internet cafe in Changzhi, north China's Shanxi province June 20, 2007. REUTERS/Stringer BEIJING Three Chinese Internet operators have apologized for failing to purge "vulgar" content following a government pledge this week to expose and shut down offending websites. China on Monday launched a renewed crackdown to stamp out vulgar current on the Internet, which analysts linked to a broader campaign to stifle dissent and protest as the economy slows in a year of politically sensitive anniversaries. Officials named and shamed 19 Internet operators and websites, including search engines Google and Baidu, it said had flouted warnings about pornography and other content deemed inappropriate by state censors. "We feel deeply guilty," Baidu, China's number one search engine, said in a statement posted on its website on Wednesday. "We apologize to Internet users for any negative effects given to society." NetEase.com.Inc, China's number two online game operator, and SINA Corp also issued public apologies on their websites. "As to our problems and any harm they could possibly have caused Internet users, SINA feels deeply sad and concerned," the online media group said. Google's China office stopped short of offering an apology on its website, but promised to "work hard" with Internet users and society to build a healthy Internet culture. "After we received notice from relevant government departments ... (we) cleaned up links to vulgar content that could have adverse effects on Internet users," it said (here). China's ruling Communist Party is wary of threats to its grip on information and has conducted numerous censorship efforts targeting porn, anti-government criticism and websites selling fake drugs. Analysts have linked the campaign to broader efforts to stifle dissent ahead of sensitive political dates this year, especially the 20th anniversary year of the government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests centered on Beijing's Tian'anmen Square in 1989. China has warned Google and other popular web portals that they must do more to block pornographic material from reaching Chinese users, the latest in a series of government crackdowns targeting internet content.

Matt Smith revealed as 11th incarnation of Doctor Who
The great thing about Doctor Who, as a colleague pointed out, is that you don't have to watch the show to feel part of it. Even when you've exhausted, or been exhausted by "Who will be the next Doctor?" and moved into "I'm sorry, who will be the next Doctor? ", there's still a full cycle of gossip to come: you can speculate about the identity of the Doctor's companion, and then the guest stars, and then the year's big villain, and then – as a pick-me-up at the end – whether this season will be the Doctor's last. At this rate, by the time Matt Smith actually steps into the Tardis, in 2010, we'll probably be vigorously debating the merits of his successor. The BBC certainly knows the value of the publicity to what is, according to audience satisfaction figures, its most-loved show. Whereas the Queen only gets 10 minutes over Christmas, the show's producers were offered a full half-hour on Saturday evening for their message to the nation. Even with all the careful priming, even with the drip-drip of comments that this was the youngest Doctor, that he was only 26, the moment when the boy himself popped up on screen was still a shock. Still, the BBC seems to have got away with it – according to the instant polling provided by a trawl through Facebook, groups such as "We hate Matt Smith as Doctor Who!!!!" Like the actor who must finally accept that he is too old to play the Dane, we have suddenly become Older Than The Doctor, forced to accept that even if we could go gallivanting around the universe with the time-travelling Gallifreyan, we'd be too busy worrying about our pensions to enjoy it.

United Nations suspends operations in Gaza after schools and trucks are hit by Israeli forces
Homes, mosques and government buildings have been hit in the Israeli bombardment [AFP] Homes, mosques and government buildings have been hit in the Israeli bombardment [AFP] 'Tragic deaths' John Ging, the head of Unrwa in Gaza, said the casualties in Thursday's convoy attack were Palestinian civilian contractors hired to bring supplies from the crossing points. "They were co-ordinating their movements with the Israelis, as they always do, only to find themselves being fired at from the ground troops," he told Al Jazeera. We have been reassured continuously over the last number of days that these incidents will not reoccur, and I have taken that in good faith because of the humanitarian imperative. "We want to believe we are safe here ... but the bottom line is that I've lost confidence in the Israeli side and that needs to be restored urgently, and it is their duty to restore this confidence," Ging said. All convoys to Erez and the Kerem Shalom, which has been the main crossing point used for bringing humanitarian supplies into Gaza, were suspended after the incident. Also on Thursday, Israel said it halted its military operations for three hours to allow humanitarian aid into the strip. Rafah bombing Thousands of Palestinians fled their homes in the southern Gaza Strip as Israeli forces bombarded Rafah earlier on Thursday. The Israeli military had dropped leaflets beforehand, warning it would "bomb the area due to its use by terrorists to [dig] tunnels and to stock up [on weapons]".

Spider-Man to save Obama's Inauguration Day in upcoming Marvel comic
NEW YORK Barack Obama will be "nerd-in-chief" when he takes office as U.S. president this month, according to Marvel Comics, which is putting him on the cover of its next "Spider-Man" comic. The special edition of the weekly Spider-Man comic features a six-page story about the superhero saving the day when an imposter tries to take Obama's place as president. It is due to hit newsstands next Wednesday. Marvel editor in chief Joe Quesada said the idea for the "Spidey meets the President!" edition came from a statement from Obama's campaign listing 10 little known facts about the Democrat who will be America's first black president. "Right at the top of that list was he collected Spider-Man comics," Quesada told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. "I was inundated with tons of fan mail saying 'Have you read this?'" "I was just floored, absolutely floored, to find out that the future commander-in-chief was actually going to be the future nerd-in-chief." Excitement about Obama's election has already fueled a boom in memorabilia, from posters to front pages of November 5 newspapers announcing his victory. The Spider-Man edition, likely to become an instant collectors' item, features Obama on the cover, smiling and giving a thumbs-up. Spidey hangs upside down behind him whispering in his ear: "Hey, if you get to be on my cover, can I be on the dollar bill?"

Illinois House impeaches Blagojevich
Hours after the Illinois House of Representatives voted 114-1 to impeach Gov. Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges that include his allegedly trying to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama, the governor reiterated Friday, "I am not guilty of any criminal wrongdoing." "I am confident that at the end of the day, I will be properly exonerated," Blagojevich said at a rambling press conference which ended, as had his first news conference following his Dec. 9 arrest, with his quoting a British poet. Blagojevich added that the full House vote was "not a surprise" because, "What the House did today they've been talking about doing for the last couple of years." He was joined onstage at his news conference by a man in a wheelchair and various other individuals he claimed were helped by his policies, and he blamed the Illinois House for repeatedly standing in the way of his bringing advances to the people of Illinois. He referenced various efforts to extend health care only to be blocked, he said, by a House chamber that "consistently stood in the way of those expansions." After quoting Rudyard Kipling at an earlier press conference, the governor this time drew from Alfred Lord Tennyson's "Ulysses," reciting, "Though we are not now the strength which in old days moved Earth and Heaven, that which we are, we are. One equal temper, of heroic hearts, made weak by time and by fate, but strong in will, to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield." Blagojevich has harmed the people of this state, and by refusing to recognize his utter inability to govern effectively, he continues this harm," she said. "I call on the governor, once again, to do what is right, what is best for the people and what is clearly long overdue: The governor should resign immediately." Impeachment Process The article of impeachment -- essentially an indictment -- now goes to the state Senate for a trial, which requires a two-thirds vote to convict Blagojevich and remove him from office.

Strongest earthquake in 150 years hits Costa Rica
(CNN) -- The number of people killed from an earthquake in Costa Rica rose to 34 on Saturday, a government official said. Rigoberto Vargas weeps with his daughters for his missing son on Saturday in San Miguel di Sarapiqui. Another 64 people were listed as missing two days after the 6.1-magnitude earthquake shook north-central Costa Rica, the official said. Emergency personnel continued to search for victims affected by the quake, according to Ministry of Infrastructure spokeswoman Silvia Chaves. Rescuers reached 200 tourists who had been stranded in a hotel in Varablanca, and they were taken to safety, she said. "I saw how the Earth moved and how it took my family -- my aunt, my cousin and her babies," Miguel Angel Marin told CNN affiliate Teletica TV. More than 1,200 people were stranded, without a way to get out of towns or homes, Red Cross official Milton Chaverri said. Send photos, video The remote area near Alajuela, where the quake hit strongest, is difficult to reach, and officials said they were having to rely on helicopters for medical evacuations and to airlift supplies.

MV Sirius Star oil tanker released by pirates
The Saudi supertanker seized by Somali pirates in the world's biggest ever hijacking has been freed following a reported ransom payment of $3m. Last night the US navy released a photo showing a small package apparently containing the ransom parachuting to the deck of the Sirius Star from a small aircraft. A parachute apparently containing the $3m ransom floats down to the hijacked Sirius Star. Photograph: David Hudson/AP The Sirius Star, which was carrying 2m barrels of oil when it was captured on November 15, sailed from the pirate lair of Harardheere on Somalia's eastern coast today. Two Britons – chief engineer Peter French, from County Durham, and second officer James Grady, from Renfrewshire – are among the crew of 25 who were all reported to be unharmed. "All our people have now left the Sirius Star. The ship is free, the crew is free," Mohamed Said, one of the pirate leaders, told Agence France-Presse by telephone. "There were last-minute problems but now everything has been finalised." An associate of the pirates, who call themselves the Central Regional Coastguard (CRC), said the owner of the ship, the oil giant Saudi Aramco, had paid a ransom of $3m (£2m). The hijacking of the 330-metre long vessel was the culmination of a dramatic surge in piracy off Somalia this year.

Too Grimm? Mother Goose cartoonist sued by Colombian coffee growers
The character of Juan Valdez was created 50 years ago Colombian coffee growers are planning to sue a US cartoonist for millions of dollars over a cartoon they say damages the reputation of Colombian coffee. The cartoon is by Mike Peters, whose work is published in the US and abroad. In it, one character refers to crime in Colombia and then to Juan Valdez, the fictional coffee grower used for years to advertise Colombian coffee. The cartoon strip which appeared on 2 January is part of the Mother Goose and Grimm series that Mr Peters draws. Another character comments: "Y'know, there's a big crime syndicate in Colombia. The comic strip finishes with Mother Goose drinking tea. National dignity Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation, Fedecafe, said they had instructed their lawyers in the US to begin proceedings against Mr Peters and the agency which distributes his work, for "damage and harm, detriment to intellectual property and defamation". In a statement, Fedecafe said the cartoon "associated organised crime and the atrocities committed by violent groups with the hard, delicate and honest work of more than 500,000 coffee growers and their families". The cartoon also affected the reputation of Juan Valdez, the "icon and symbol" of Colombian coffee, by suggesting that there was a connection between coffee tins and the victims of violence, Fedecafe said. The iconic coffee grower, accompanied by his faithful mule, was created in 1959, and has appeared in countless TV advertisements, in the US and elsewhere.

Parajet Skycar expedition takes off from London to Timbuktu
LONDON, England (CNN) -- From the noisy and lovable Chitty Chitty Bang Bang to the time-traveling DeLorean in "Back to the Future," flying cars have been a fixture of movies and science fiction that never quite cut it in the real world -- until now. The Skycar's fabric wing is folded and packed in the back of the car when driving on the road. A flying car devised by a British inventor and a team of engineers took off from London on Wednesday on an epic journey to Timbuktu, Mali, in West Africa -- a trip they hope will prove the fantasy has become reality. The "Skycar" is a road-legal all-terrain buggy with a huge rear propeller and a fabric wing, the result of 18 months of design and research. "We started with a car rather than starting with an aircraft and made a car into an aircraft," said Skycar's creator, Giles Cardozo. "It's a really exciting piece of kit to drive but of course, it also flies." Its design gives it the performance of a motorbike while also allowing it to fly over impassable terrain and the sand seas of the Sahara, the designers said. The two-person seat is a tight fit with room for a driver and a passenger who controls the car in flight. Don't Miss Skycar Expedition 2009 "I'm a bit nervous, but that's what adventure and exploration's all about," Laughton told CNN. The flexible wing is folded and packed in the back of the car when driving on the road and can deploy immediately when it is ready to fly.

Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Day 20
(CNN) -- Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has apparently released a new audio message calling for a jihad, or holy war, against Israel for its Gaza campaign. Osama bin Laden, in an undated photo, apparently taped a message calling for jihad against Israel. The 22-minute message contains "an invitation" from bin Laden to take part in "jihad to stop the aggression against Gaza." The audio message was posted on a radical Islamist Web site that has posted other statements from bin Laden in the past. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the message, but the speaker's voice was similar to other recordings that bin Laden has made. Watch as experts discuss Osama message » "[America is] now drowning in a global financial crisis," he said. "The decline of the American power is one of the main reasons for Israel's rushed and barbaric aggression on Gaza in a desperate attempt to take advantage of the last days of [President] Bush's term in office." He appears, however, to refer to Obama, saying "Bush leaves his successor with the worst inheritance ... two long guerrilla wars and no options. "Here is Biden, the vice president of the president-elect ... [he] says that the crisis is bigger than they expected and that the American economy, all of it, is open to collapse," bin Laden said. On December 20, Biden said in an interview that the economy "is in much worse shape than we thought it was in."

Australian writer Harry Nicolaides jailed for three years for insulting Thai Royal Family
Pressure Thailand to release jailed Aust author: Xenophon Updated Independent Senator Nick Xenophon has called on the Federal Government to do everything it can to bring an Australian man jailed in Thailand back home. Melbourne writer Harry Nicolaides, 41, has been jailed for three years in Bangkok over a passage he wrote in a 2005 novel about the Thai Crown Prince. Senator Xenophon says the Government should put pressure on Thailand to allow him to return to Australia. His Australian lawyer, Mark Dean SC, says the imprisonment has taken a heavy toll on his physical and mental health. His legal team will apply for a royal pardon this week but he has already served five months in jail. Mr Hulls says he is trying to find out if the Victorian Government can help. Australian writer Harry Nicolaides waits inside a detention cell of the Bangkok's Criminal Court January 19, 2009. Nicolaides pleaded guilty to defaming Thailand's crown prince on Monday and faces up to 15 years in jail when he is sentenced later in the day. Nicolaides pleaded guilty to defaming Thailand's crown prince on Monday and faces up to 15 years in jail when he is sentenced later in the day.

Steelers, Cardinals win championship games to advance to Super Bowl XLIII
After becoming the first rookie quarterback in N.F.L. history to win two playoff games, Flacco ran into the Steelers’ ferocious top-ranked defense at Heinz Field. They sacked Flacco three times, intercepted him three times, forced 17 incompletions in 30 attempts and held him to 141 yards passing. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “I’m not blaming it on any rookie-wall stuff,” Flacco said. “I don’t believe in any of that stuff.” Flacco entered the game here lacking the star power or statistical prowess of his counterpart, the Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger. But as he neared the end of his first season, Flacco had already compiled a rookie campaign better than even Roethlisberger had in 2004. The key difference: two playoff victories, compared with one. Never mind that Flacco had never played on a stage this size. Forget that he first played organized football in seventh grade, that he transferred from the University of Pittsburgh to Delaware, that he started training camp third on the Ravens’ depth chart, or that he threw seven interceptions in his first five N.F.L. During that stretch, he threw 13 touchdown passes and five interceptions.

Death sentences in 2008 Chinese tainted milk scandal
SHIJIAZHUANG, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- The former board chairwoman of the Sanlu Group, Tian Wenhua, plans to appeal after being sentenced to jail for life for her role in the melamine scandal, according to her lawyer Liang Zikai on Saturday. prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" / Liang told Xinhua that Tian plans to appeal because the judgment said that the milk powder produced by Sanlu since Aug. 2damaged consumers' health, while she and her lawyers believe the ruling lacks evidence. Tian was convicted of manufacturing and selling fake or substandard products by the Shijiazhuang Intermediate People's Court and sentenced to life in prison Thursday. Three other former Sanlu executives received sentences of 5 to 15 years in jail for their roles in the scandal that left at least six Chinese infants dead and almost 300,000 ill. Sanlu decided to limit the level of melamine within 10 mg for every kg of milk, instead of ceasing production of melamine-tainted products, on Aug. 1 last year after the Hebei Provincial Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau confirmed samples sent by the company were contaminated. Tian said last month during her trial that she made the decision not to halt production of the tainted products because a board member, designated by New Zealand dairy product giant Fonterra that partly owned Sanlu Group, presented her a document saying a maximum of 20 mg of melamine was allowed in every kg of milk in the European Union. She said she had trusted the document at that time. Liang said Tian should be convicted of liability in a major accident instead of manufacturing and selling fake or substandard products. Tian would have received a sentence of up to seven years in jail under a conviction of liability of a major accident. Mao said those who still remained in designated hospitals for having stones in kidney an d other parts of urinary system after drinking melamine contaminated milk, will continue to receive free treatment. "Children under three years old, who had drunk tainted milk and had disease symptoms could still come to local hospitals for check-ups, and would receive free treatment if diagnosed with stones in the urinary system," the spokesman said.

Encyclopædia Britannica fights back against Wikipedia, soon to let users edit contents
What do television presenter Vernon Kay, Apple's CEO Steve Jobs and senator Ted Kennedy have in common? Answer: they have all been falsely reported as dead on Wikipedia. Premature news of Ted Kennedy's demise appeared on the day of President Obama's inauguration, along with a similar report about the supposed death of the longest serving senator, Robert Byrd. They are just the latest incidents in a long and rich history of vandalism since the 2001 launch of the online encyclopaedia which anyone can amend. To date, Wikipedia has allowed almost anybody to make changes to most of its 2.7m entries. Until an American journalist was falsely linked in 2005 to the JFK assassination, you didn't even have to be registered to make changes. But the false death notices of two of America's most prominent politicians has lead co-founder Jimmy Wales to propose that all future amendments by site users now be approved by a group of editors. Some Wiki enthusiasts are worried that the future of the site, currently ranked as the world's seventh largest, will be threatened. Inevitably, the site is open to puerile abuse. In the entry for Obama's predecessor, a prankster wrote that "dubya" stood for "w******". At the height of his unpopularity, Tony Blair was briefly given the middle-name "Whoop-de-doo", while one vandal erased the entire entry for Harry Potter, replacing it with the brutal plot spoiler: "Snape is the half-blood prince and kills Dumbledore."

Ten climbers killed in avalanche at Turkish ski resort
An avalanche slammed into a group of Turkish hikers on a trip to a remote mountain plateau on Sunday, dragging them more than 1,640 feet into a valley and fatally burying 10. The members of a skiing and mountaineering club were taking part in an annual winter sports celebration on 7,200-foot Mount Zigana. Seventeen were hiking single-file when the avalanche swept into them. In France, on Sunday two female skiers lost their lives in the Savoie region - a woman in her seventies when she was hit by an avalanche while cross-country skiing in Areches Beaufort, and a 45-year-old Swiss woman who was when skiing off-piste in La Toussuire. The body of a 21-year-old man was also uncovered by a team of sniffer dogs after he was buried in a metre of snow while skiing off-piste in the Deux-Alpes holiday resort. Finally, two skiers, aged 16 and 18, also lost their lives while skiing off-piste in Saint-Francois-Longchamp at the Valmorel resort, despite the efforts of the emergency services to revive them. French weather forecasters had given out an avalanche warning on Saturday. ISTANBUL An avalanche that swept down a mountain near a small winter resort killed 10 climbers in northeast Turkey on Sunday, but seven of their companions survived the crush, a government minister said.

Orange-clad search teams and locals equipped with shovels and accompanied by dogs continued to scour the snowy slopes as the light faded.

Conservative Prime Minister Geir Haarde announced the resignation of his cabinet, after talks with his Social Democratic coalition partners failed. He said he could not accept the Social Democrats' demand to lead the country. Iceland's financial system collapsed in October under the weight of debt, leading to a currency crisis, rising unemployment and daily protests. The economy is forecast to shrink by almost 10% this year. Mr Haarde told reporters on Monday: "We couldn't accept the Social Democratic demand that they would lead the government."

Tamil Tigers promise to fight back against Sri Lankan forces
Sri Lankan troops kept the heat on the Tamil Tiger separatists on Monday, a day after seizing the last big town held by the rebels, Mullaittivu. The army's commander, Lieutenant-General Sarath Fonseka, has said the military is close to ending one of Asia's longest-running wars. Few would disagree now that he has the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) all but encircled. Here are some scenarios of what could happen next: FONSEKA'S MARCH TO THE SEA: This month alone, soldiers have run the Tigers out of their self-proclaimed capital Kilinochchi, the Jaffna Peninsula and now the port of Mullaittivu, a major LTTE operations base. When hostilities were reignited in August 2006, the rebels held 15,000 square km (5,792 sq miles). Now, Fonseka says they have only 300 square km (186 square miles) of jungle and a diminishing stretch of the northeastern coast. Much as U.S. civil war Major-General William Tecumseh Sherman made the rebel Confederate army surrender by forcing them to all but jump in the sea at Savannah, Georgia, Fonseka is doing the same -- unless his troops seize the coast and surround the LTTE. Since the Tigers wear vials of cyanide around their necks in case of capture, surrender seems unlikely. Many analysts say the rebels are down to about 2,000 capable fighters and have little future as a conventional force. The LTTE still can carry out suicide bombings in the capital Colombo, and is blamed for one Just after Kilinochchi fell. Fonseka has said he expects the hardest-core Tigers to go underground and conduct hit-and-run attacks once the war nears its end.

Widespread strike action may hit France
PARIS Jan 27 France's eight labour unions have called on public and private workers to go on strike on Thursday to demand that the government and company managers do more to protect jobs and salaries during the economic crisis. Both the unions and the government expect massive turnout, with an opinion poll published by the newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche saying 69 percent of French people backed it. Following are some facts about the planned strike. The unions have been seething since President Nicolas Sarkozy said last July that France had changed so rapidly under his stewardship that "these days, when there is a strike, nobody notices". After a first 18 months in power when no amount of protest could deter Sarkozy from pushing through his reform plans, he has recently shelved an unpopular shake-up of the high school system after street protests. If there is massive participation in the strike, that could further discourage Sarkozy from attempting tough reforms. It could potentially hobble France, with strikes expected to hit schools, hospitals, law courts, public transport, flights, postal services, France Telecom FTE.PA, energy providers EDF (EDF.PA) and GDF Suez GSZ.PA, shipyards, public television and radio stations. The eight unions issued a joint document listing demands on both the government and company managers.

US novelist John Updike dies age 76
Renowned US novelist John Updike has died at the age of 76, his publisher has announced. He had been suffering from lung cancer. Updike won many top literary prizes, including Pulitzers for two volumes of his famous Rabbit series. In about 50 books over half a century, he chronicled sex, divorce and other aspects of life in post-war America. He once told an interviewer that his subject was "the American small town, Protestant middle class". He died in a hospice near his home in Beverly Farms, Massachussetts, his publisher said. The son of a schoolmaster, Updike was born in Pennsylvania in 1932 and, after attending Harvard, spent a year as an art student in Oxford in the UK. Later he joined the staff of the New Yorker magazine, to which he contributed numerous poems, essays and short stories. Updike's first novel, The Poorhouse Fair, was published in 1959. The following year, though, saw the publication of the book which established him as one of the greatest novelists of his age, Rabbit, Run.

Red Cross urges Sri Lanka to respect lives of Tamil civilians
(For related story, click on [nCOL285917] By C. Bryson Hull COLOMBO, Jan 28 (Reuters) -- Hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans are trapped in a war zone that is now roughly 300 square km (115 sq miles) and the scene of heavy fighting between the Tamil Tiger rebels and a Sri Lankan army smelling victory. Here are questions and answers about their situation. The United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross say that around 250,000 people, nearly all Tamils, are trapped in the fighting. The government says that figure is too high. The Tigers have not given a tally but on Tuesday, the pro-rebel web site www.TamilNet.com said 300,000 people now face hunger. The ICRC, the only aid agency with a permanent presence in the war zone, say hundreds have been killed and injured, but has not given an exact figure. The government tacitly acknowledged casualties on Wednesday, but says it has no official number and says figures reported so far are inflated. TamilNet says more than 300 have been killed and 1,000 wounded. Human Rights Watch and the Sri Lankan government say the Tigers have forced people to stay at gunpoint, and are using them to fight, build defences or act as a human shield. The Tigers, who for years have had a policy of making every family hand one person over to fight, deny that.

Scottish politician to face perjury trial
The couple have denied the allegations of perjury Former Solidarity MSP and Celebrity Big Brother contestant Tommy Sheridan and his wife Gail are to stand trial on perjury charges. The charges relate to evidence given during Mr Sheridan's defamation victory against the News of the World in 2006. The newspaper had published sex and drugs claims against Mr Sheridan. The couple, both aged 44, were charged with perjury in December 2007 following an investigation by Lothian and Borders Police. The investigation was launched after a judge said conflicting evidence in the defamation trial may have meant some people were perjuring themselves. Mr Sheridan and his wife have consistently denied the allegations and criticised the way Lothian and Borders Police handled the subsequent investigation. During a news conference on Tuesday, the couple's solicitor, Aamer Anwar, read a statement confirming that they would stand trial. Mr Sheridan was evicted from Celebrity Big Brother on 21 January He said: "I can confirm that an indictment was served today for charges of perjury against Thomas and Gail Sheridan. "A preliminary hearing is fixed for 26 February 2009 at the High Court in Edinburgh and a trial will then be fixed for later on in the year. "As proceedings are live it would be inappropriate to comment further, other than to state that both Mr and Mrs Sheridan maintain their innocence and are determined to fight this.

Iran's Ahmadinejad wants change in US policies, not 'tactics'
Iran's president called for the U.S. to apologize for past misdeeds Wednesday but also said the country would welcome a real and fundamental shift in foreign policy from the new American administration. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's comments came after President Barack Obama indicated a new willingness to reach out to Muslims and the importance of engaging with Iran, a country the Bush administration often singled out as the most dangerous in the region. Without mentioning Obama by name, Ahmadinejad repeatedly referred to those who want to bring "change," a word used often in Obama's election campaign, and seemed to indicate Iran would be looking to see whether there would be substantive differences in U.S. policy under Obama. "We will wait patiently, listen to their words carefully, scrutinize their actions under a magnifier and if change happens truly and fundamentally, we will welcome that," Ahmadinejad said, speaking to a crowd of thousands in the western city of Kermanshah. 'Dark background' But the Iranian leader also criticized the U.S. and demanded an apology. "Those who say they want to make change, this is the change they should make: they should apologize to the Iranian nation and try to make up for their dark background and the crimes they have committed against the Iranian nation," Ahmadinejad said. He listed a range of "crimes" such as trying to block what Tehran says is a peaceful nuclear power generation program, hindering Iran's development since the 1979 revolution and other actions by several administrations for more than 60 years. In his speech, Ahmadinejad said: "Who has asked them (the United States) to come and interfere in the affairs of nations? "Change means giving up support for the rootless, uncivilized, fabricated, murdering... Zionists and let the Palestinian nation decide its own destiny," he said. Speaking in his first formal television interview as president, Obama told Al-Arabiya news channel that Iran must "unclench its fist". The new administration has said Obama would break from his predecessor by pursuing direct talks with Tehran but has also warned Iran to expect more pressure if it did not meet the U.N. Security Council demand to halt its disputed nuclear work.

Zimbabwe opposition agrees to join government
Mr. Tsvangirai first agreed to form a joint government in September, but then refused after Mr. Mugabe claimed control of all the ministries that control the repressive state security forces, including the police. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But at the insistence of the Southern African Development Community, the 15-nation regional bloc overseeing the negotiations, the current deal calls for shared oversight of the police — a compromise Mr. Tsvangirai had initially rejected. Acknowledging the ambivalence of many of his supporters — and perhaps his own, as well — Mr. Tsvangirai said in a statement that the fight for democracy “is neither easy nor straightforward, and often we have had to change the fronts on which we wage the struggle.” Political analysts said he would have risked the scorn of South Africa, the dominant regional powerhouse, and other neighboring nations, had he pulled out of the deal that they had, with increasing impatience, been pressing him to accept.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story Botswana’s president, Seretse Khama Ian Khama, said in a rare interview that allowing leaders to keep power through negotiated deals after fraud-ridden elections, as in Kenya last year and now in Zimbabwe, set a terrible precedent.

When Mr. Tsvangirai came out and stood on the bed of a pickup truck with a bullhorn in hand, the crowd fell silent waiting for word of his decision. A wave of cheers rolled over him when he said he would be prime minister, his spokesman, Joseph Mungwari, said.

US Republicans elect first African-American chairman
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Members of the Republican National Committee elected their first African-American party chief Friday, choosing former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele to chair the organization after six tumultuous rounds of voting. Michael Steele was chosen Friday as the first African-American leader of the Republican Party. The often contentious race for the chairmanship came down to a choice on the final ballot between Steele and Katon Dawson, the South Carolina GOP chairman who secured strong support from party insiders after former RNC leader Mike Duncan dropped out of the race earlier in the day. Steele emerged as the winner on the sixth ballot, winning 91 votes to Dawson's 77. "We're going to say to friend and foe alike, we want you to be a part of us," Steele told party members in his victory speech. "And to those of you who will obstruct, get ready to get knocked over." Watch Steele's remarks to the RNC » For the duration of his campaign, Steele fought suspicions that he was too moderate to lead the party because of his blue state roots and his former membership in the Republican Leadership Council, a group that sought to curb the influence of social conservatives in the party. "I'm proud to say I'm a conservative, have been, always will be," Steele told CNN this month. Steele was similarly hampered by the perception that he was too much of an outsider to run the 168-member committee, but he was able to demonstrate momentum in the final days of the campaign by rolling out a cluster of endorsements. He also boasted the help of some of the country's top political consultants: At a closed-door question-and-answer session with members late Thursday, Steele told the crowd he had spent more than $200,000 on the race, more than any other contender. Read how iReporters would like to see the Republican Party move forward The new chairman brings a national profile to the committee, having shot to fame in the political world during an underdog Senate bid in 2006 distinguished by a series of clever TV commercials. He has since become a fixture on cable talk shows, experience that boosted his reputation as the most able communicator in the field of candidates. During the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota, last summer, Steele made a splash by coining the phrase "Drill, baby, drill," which quickly morphed into a rallying cry for the GOP base at campaign rallies around the country.

British PM condemns walkouts
Wildcat strikes are "not defensible", Gordon Brown has told those angry at the employment of foreign workers. Hundreds of employees staged walkouts across the UK over the use of foreign staff at a Lincolnshire refinery. The PM told the BBC's Politics Show he understood workers' fears, but walkouts were "not the right thing to do". The Tories said they did not back the strikes either but said Mr Brown's 2007 "British jobs for British workers" pledge had been exposed as "fiction". Unofficial "sympathy strikes" spread across the country after workers walked out at the Lindsey Oil Refinery when owner Total gave a £200m contract to Italian firm IREM. You'll find that no government in history is doing more to try and find ways that we can help people who are unemployed back in to work as quickly as possible Gordon Brown PM says 'no clear map' for crisis Mandelson warns on protectionism The government has called in independent mediator Acas to look into claims that British workers are being illegally excluded from engineering and construction projects, while unions have urged Mr Brown to meet heads of industry in the sectors as soon as possible. 'Undercut' Speaking from the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Mr Brown said instead of spontaneous strike action, "what we've got to do over time, as I've always said, is that where there are jobs in this country, we need people with the skills, developed in this country". Tackled about his 2007 Labour conference pledge to create "British jobs for British workers" - a slogan used by the striking refinery workers - Mr Brown said: "Well, we are part of a single European market but I have always understood the worries that people have. WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW On BBC One: The Politics Show, 1200, Sunday 1 February Or watch it for up to seven days on the BBC iPlayer "They look round and say, well, why can't we do these jobs, jobs ourselves, these are jobs that we can do. "When, when I talked about British jobs, I was taking about giving people in Britain the skills, so that they have the ability to get jobs which were at present going to people from abroad." Health Secretary Alan Johnson said EU laws guaranteeing employment rights had been "undermined" by two recent judgements in the European Court of Justice and the government would push for action at a European level if it was proved British workers were being "undercut" by cheap labour from other parts of the EU. HAVE YOUR SAY It is a shame that it has come to this, but necessary if this is the only way it will get our government to put our interests above others.

Nuclear sites close as more UK workers walkout
The wave of wildcat strike action that has swept across the UK escalated today as hundreds more workers walked out in the protest against foreign labour. Contract workers from the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria, the Heysham nuclear power station in Lancashire and a site at Staythorpe, in Nottinghamshire, joined the unofficial action over the hiring of Italian and Portuguese workers on a Lincolnshire power station project. Workers from the Longannet power station in Scotland joined those at the Grangemouth oil refinery, who voted to continue their strike, while 200 employees at Fiddlers Ferry power station in Widnes, Cheshire, also walked out this morning. In west Wales, up to 500 contractors at the South Hook LNG gas terminal in Milford Haven downed tools for a second day. Many of the strikers took part in a similar protest on Friday. Around 150 contract workers at Aberthaw power station, in south Wales, also walked out. Outside the Lindsey oil refinery in Killingholme, Lincolnshire, where the protests began, more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered for a mass meeting, voting unanimously to allow union officials to start talks with management.

Shoe thrown at Chinese PM during speech at Cambridge University in the UK
The Chinese prime minister was giving a speech about the global economy A 27-year-old man has been charged after a shoe was thrown at Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao during a visit to Cambridge University. Police said the man would appear before magistrates in Cambridge on 10 February accused of committing a public order offence. The shoe was thrown at Mr Wen and he was called a "dictator" as he gave a speech on the global economy on Monday. The premier, on a three-day UK visit, described the incident as "despicable". Mr Wen was giving his speech having earlier signed a series of trade agreements with UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Witnesses said the shoe landed about a metre away from Mr Wen. The protest was similar to an event in December when US President George W Bush was forced to duck to avoid shoes thrown at him by an Iraqi journalist in Baghdad. The shoe landed several meters from the premier and the man was quickly apprehended by security and handed over to police for questioning on suspicion of committing a public order offence, according to witnesses. A student who witnessed the incident told CNN that the man had stood up and shouted, "Why are you prostituting yourself? How can you listen to the lies he is telling?"

Obama cabinet nominees withdraw over tax issues
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday admitted he made a mistake in handling the nomination of Tom Daschle as his Health and Human Services secretary, saying Daschle's tax problems sent a message that the politically powerful are treated differently than average people. Daschle, the former Democratic leader in the U.S. Senate, withdrew earlier Tuesday as news that he failed to pay some taxes in the past continued to stir opposition on Capitol Hill. "I think I screwed up," Obama said in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. "And, I take responsibility for it and we're going to make sure we fix it so it doesn't happen again." Daschle had apologized Monday for what he said were honest mistakes, calling them an embarrassment. The series of errors included improperly reporting $15,000 in charitable donations, failing to list $80,000 in lobbying income due to what Daschle said was a paperwork error and not reporting a car and driver loaned to him by a friend and business associate as income. Watch the president say he made a mistake » Daschle recently filed amended tax returns, and paid more than $140,000 in back taxes and interest for 2005-2007.

Saudi most-wanted list includes former Guantanamo captives
Al-Qaeda's Yemen branch reportedly has a new deputy chief, a Saudi named Saeed al-Shihri. When I was in Saudi Arabia in 2007 to report on the Kingdom's much publicized rehabilitation program, which aims to turn jihadi fighters into peaceful citizens, al-Shihri was one of the enrollees. Saeed al-Shihiri, from an undated video posted on a militant-leaning website on Jan. 23, 2009. The identity was confirmed by a U.S. intelligence official but has not been independently verified. (SITE Intelligence Group/Associated Press) After spending six years in U.S. custody at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, he was sent to his homeland and entered the Saudi rehab in November 2007. According to an internet news release by Yemen militants, corroborated by the New York Times quoting an unnamed U.S. intelligence official, al-Shihri has become a top member of Yemen's al-Qaeda affiliate. Several media outlets have claimed that al-Shihri was involved in an attack on the U.S. embassy in Yemen in September 2008, though that is difficult to prove. It is clearly going to be a problem as well for the Muslim and Western nations, including Canada, who are being asked to consider taking back their own detained citizens and somehow deal with them.

American baseball star Rodriguez admits to using performance enhancing drugs
New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez admitted to ESPN's Peter Gammons today in an exclusive interview that he took performance-enhancing drugs from 2001 to 2003. "I did take a banned substance, and for that, I'm very sorry," Rodriguez said. Rodriguez told Gammons that he felt an "enormous amount of pressure" when he arrived as a member of the Texas Rangers in 2001 after signing the largest contract in Major League Baseball history. I wanted to prove to everyone I was worth being one of the greatest players of all time," Rodriguez said. "I'm guilty of being negligent and naive and not asking the right questions." He said he took the banned substances from 2001 to 2003 and has not taken any since. Play "Since then, I've proved to myself and to everyone that I don't need any of that," he said. Rodriguez was voted the American League's Most Valuable Player in 2003, when he belted 47 home runs and led the league in slugging. "I just feel that I'm sorry for that time, I'm sorry for fans, I'm sorry for family in Texas," Rodriguez said today. Rodriguez reportedly tested positive for the banned substances Primobolan and testosterone in 2003 while still with the Texas Rangers, a year before Major League Baseball implemented a program to suspend players who were found using performance-enhancing drugs, according to a report from Sports Illustrated. His sample, along with 103 other players who tested positive, could legally have been destroyed by the players union, but for reasons still unknown, the samples were kept and later seized by federal investigators. A-Rod Denied Steroid Use in 2007 Since Sports Illustrated broke the news this weekend that Rodriguez, 33, had tested positive for Primobolan and testosterone, he, along with the players union and Major League Baseball, had remained silent before speaking with Gammons today.

Police believe some of the fires were started deliberately - actions which Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said amounted to "mass murder". Survivors have recounted how they fled walls of flames. Some rural towns have been completely destroyed. Police have sealed off a number of sites, including the devastated small town of Maryville, as possible crime scenes. Victoria State Premier John Brumby said: "We have had whole communities just completely wiped out, completely obliterated, by what people would describe as literally a fireball that just came over the hills and devoured everything before them.

Subject of high-profile Italian euthanasia case dies
Eluana Englaro, seen in this undated photo, fell into a vegetative state following a car accident in 1992. ((Englaro family/Associated Press)) The Italian woman at the centre of a high-profile euthanasia debate has died, media agencies reported Monday. Eluana Englaro, who had been in a vegetative state for 17 years, died in a clinic in the northeastern city of Udine, the ANSA and Apcom news agencies said. "Yes, she has left us," her father, Beppino Englaro, told ANSA. Englaro's case has pitted right-to-die activists against the anti-euthanasia movement. Late last year, her father won an intense 10-year legal battle to allow her feeding tubes to be removed, saying that was her wish. In line with the high court ruling, medical workers on Friday began gradually suspending food and water for Englaro. Berlusconi's government had passed an emergency decree Friday to prevent Englaro from having her tube disconnected, but the move led to a rare institutional crisis as the country's president, Giorgio Napolitano, rejected it on the grounds it defied court rulings. Patients have a right to refuse treatment, but they are barred from giving advance directions on what treatment they wish to receive if they become unconscious.

Judd Gregg withdraws as US Commerce Secretary nominee
New Hampshire Republican Sen. Judd Gregg has withdrawn his name from consideration as President Obama's commerce secretary, a major blow to an administration seeking to put a series of Cabinet problems behind it. "It became clear to me to me that it would be very difficult day in and day out to serve in this Cabinet," Gregg said in a press conference late Thursday. He added that in the days since he was nominated he realized that to be "part of a team but not 100 percent with the team" was an untenable position. In his written statement, Gregg cited recent developments regarding the economic stimulus package and the decision to have the next census director report directly to senior White House officials as evidence that he and President Obama were too different ideologically for the pairing to work. "This was simply a bridge too far for me," Gregg said of his decision. Gregg said he would "probably not" run for re-election in 2010. Many Republicans, however, had voiced serious concerns about the potential politicization of the department given that move. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) praised Gregg's decision as "principled" and added: "It's great to have him back."

Class action launched by Australian bushfire survivors against SP AusNet
(Recasts, adds details) PERTH Feb 16 Australian energy firm SP AusNet, controlled by Singapore Power, said it was facing a class-action lawsuit relating to the country's deadliest bushfires which killed 181 people and destroyed thousands of homes. SP AusNet SPN.AX said an action was launched on Monday in the Supreme Court of the eastern state of Victoria from groups which alleged that faulty power lines owned by SP AusNet may have sparked Australia's deadliest bushfires. "We believe the claim is premature and inappropriate ... SP AusNet will vigorously defend the claim," SP AusNet's spokeswoman Louisa Graham said in an e-mailed statement. The company said its bushfire mitigation and vegetation management programmes comply with state regulations and were audited annually by state agencies. Shares in SP AusNet closed 3.7 percent lower at A$1.045 on Monday, after earlier falling as much as 13.4 percent to a one-month low of A$0.94. SP AusNet supplies power to areas in Victoria state where fires killed at least 181 people just over a week ago, destroyed more than 1,800 homes and left 7,000 people homeless. Members of the Victorian police force's Disaster Victim Identification team have spent days searching through the rubble and ash of fire-ravaged towns for anything that can identify those caught in the blazes. In many cases very little, except small amounts of DNA and pieces of jewellery, remain. Stephen Fontana, assistant police commissioner, said the job of identifying victims was a difficult and slow task but "had to be done properly". "We've actually got a team looking at unaccounted for persons and that's checking... data that we have in terms of residents that lived in those areas, bearing in mind there may have been visitors to those areas," he said. "When we start to move to cleaning many of these sites up we still may well find some parts of individuals, it's very difficult to deal with," she said.

Two nuclear submarines collide in the Atlantic Ocean
Defence chiefs are facing an inquiry into the safety of the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent after British and French submarines, each laden with missiles powerful enough for 1,248 Hiroshima bombings, collided while submerged in the mid-Atlantic. HMS Vanguard, the lead boat of Britain's fleet of four V-class submarines armed with Trident nuclear missiles, limped back into its home port of Faslane in Scotland on Saturday showing significant damage. Witnesses said the hull was scarred with dents and scrapes. The weather was rough in the middle of the night of 3 and 4 February when the British submarine, which was carrying 135 crew, struck Le Triomphant, the flagship of the French nuclear strike force, destroying the French vessel's fibreglass sonar dome, which juts out from the bow and, among other tasks, is supposed to detect other submarines. In London, the Ministry of Defence tried to maintain its policy of total secrecy about the movements of Briain's nuclear fleet, but it was forced to confirm the embarrassing collision between strategic allies after the French Navy posted details of the accident on its website. Both countries insisted that neither the missile-launching capacity nor the nuclear safety of the submarines, carrying 265 crew and 32 intercontinental ballistic missiles, were affected. Admiral Sir Jonathon Band, the First Sea Lord, said: "Recently, the two submarines came into contact at very low speed. Both submarines remained safe and no injuries occurred. Defence sources said the accident was the result of the "infinitesimal" coincidence that both submarines were operating at the same depth and location in the Atlantic. Such a claim is undermined because Nato allies routinely share information at a top-secret level about the deployment of submarines to ensure they do not occupy the same area of ocean, an arrangement in which the French, whose nuclear deterrent remains independent, are understood to participate. For many years, Britain and France have maintained their nuclear deterrent by ensuring they have at least one of their missile-carrying submarines at sea 365 days a year with the ability to launch within seconds' notice. Politicians said the incident raised serious questions about the precautions to protect the V-class nuclear vessels, which, at nearly 16,000 tonnes and 150m long, are among the largest submarines ever built.

Venezuelan referendum ends presidential term limits
CARACAS, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez won Sunday's referendum on a constitutional amendment for unlimited re-election with about 6.3 million votes, the Electoral National Council (CNE) said on Tuesday. CNE president Tibisay Lucena announced the results at a press conference, based on 99.75 percent of the tallies. Votes in favor of the amendment were 6,319,636, while votes against the amendment were 5,198,006, Lucena said. The total number of votes was 11,724,224 with 30.08 percent abstention. Nearly 17 million Venezuelans were registered to vote in the referendum. Lucena said there were still some votes to be counted, including those of Venezuelans abroad. Chavez won the referendum in 19 of the 23 states, repeating the electoral triumph of the regional elections for governors and mayors held on Nov. 23, 2008. Venezuelans on Sunday voted by 54.8% to 45.1% to change the constitution to end term limits and allow elected officials, including President Hugo Chavez, to run for re-election indefinitely. Mr Chavez has said he needs another 10 years to secure what he calls Venezuela's socialist revolution. ANA IRENE MENDEZ, 70, PROFESSOR, MARACAIBO I voted for the amendments and I am very pleased with the result. I see no problem in re-electing someone who has done a good job.

Israel seizes West Bank land
He and his ultranationalist Israel Beiteinu party finished in a strong third place in last week's parliamentary elections. Now, he is being courted as a coalition partner by both of the leading political parties. Leaders of the centrist Kadima party, which came in first, and the conservative Likud party, which finished a close second, are both aggressively wooing Lieberman. The burly 50-year-old former nightclub bouncer from Moldova and his party got more seats in the Knesset than the once-dominant Israeli Labor Party. Kadima and Likud are now offering top Cabinet positions — and more, says Danny Ayalon, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States and a newly elected member of parliament on Lieberman's ticket. "I would say the important thing right now is to have a broad-based coalition," Ayalon says. Inflaming Tensions Between Israel's Arabs And Jews But to be part of a broad-based government, Lieberman and his party have to overcome political obstacles and hostility from many corners. Many Israeli Arab politicians and Jewish liberals in Israel call Lieberman a dangerous racist for advocating a citizenship law that would require loyalty oaths to the state. Barak says many Jewish Israelis were outraged by images of Israeli Arab citizens protesting in favor of Hamas and Hezbollah during Israel's wars with those militant groups. "It got his supporters riled up, and it was able to attract support from other places," says Barak.

Sheffield pub is CAMRA's Pub of the Year
A ONCE semi-derelict "backstreet boozer" in Sheffield is being named today as the national Pub Of The Year. Real ale enthusiasts have chosen the Kelham Island Tavern as the best pub in the country, completing a remarkable turnaround in its fortunes. It only reopened seven years ago after Trevor Wraith and Lewis Gonda transformed the ramshackle building in Russell Street on an industrial fringe of the city centre – and it had to close for six weeks when it was deluged in the floods of summer 2007. But the disaster failed to dampen the enthusiasm of customers and staff – and the reward comes today with the national award from the Campaign for Real Ale, the first Sheffield pub to receive the accolade. Trevor, licensee and owner, said it usually seemed to go to "thatched country pubs in the south with a big fancy food menu", not "a small back street boozer" between factories. The award was also good for Sheffield, he said, enhancing the national reputation of Kelham Island for its real ale circuit. "I don't think a lot of people know that the cluster of real ale pubs in the area attracts hordes of people from across the country. You get to know them by name, even though they live 100 miles away. Members voted it Yorkshire Pub of The Year – the third time – on its way to scooping the top prize. National judges called anonymously to check the quality of its real ale, customer service, dcor, clientele mix and value for money. Julian Hough, Camra's pubs director and one of the final judges, said: "It truly is a pub for everyone and its attention to detail is fantastic. To have won so many awards in such a short space of time, even enduring a disastrous flood in 2007, is a true testament to the dedication and commitment of its staff."

LTTE strikes Sri Lanka capital
Two Tamil Tiger aircraft launched an attack on Colombo last night sending a message of defiance to the Sri Lankan government which believes it is close to defeating the rebels, who are holed-up in the north-east of the country. At least two people were confirmed dead last night and a further 50 injured after the Sri Lankan military shot down the light aircraft, one of which crashed into a tax office building. Rebel fighters are boxed into a 34-square mile pocket of dense forest, convincing the Sri Lankan government that an end is in sight to the decades-long civil war. Witnesses said the air attack started at around 9.30pm as two jets appeared over the city's port area. The light aircraft were met with a barrage of tracer bullets, anti-aircraft fire and flares fired from army defence positions within the city, preventing the pilots from dropping bombs. An air force spokesman, wing commander Janaka Nanayakkara, said one of the felled jets nose-dived into the tax office, shattering the front of the building. The second aircraft was brought down near the town of Katunayake, 20 miles north of Colombo. As the emergency was downgraded late last night, questions emerged over the army response amid claims dozens of bystanders were hit in a crossfire between anti-aircraft guns. The attack, the tenth of its kind in two years, heaps embarrassment on the Sri Lankan government which claimed it had destroyed the rebels' runways a fortnight ago as part of its punishing military campaign to end the 25-year conflict. The Red Cross yesterday pledged to ferry more wounded and sick civilians out of the conflict zone, amid fears of a mounting humanitarian disaster. By Alastair Lawson BBC News The rebels have carried out surprise attacks on many previous occasions The attack by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels on the capital shows that while their conventional capacity has been drastically reduced, their ability to launch surprise attacks is undiminished. They have lost significant tranches of territory to the army and most analysts agree it is only a matter of time before they lose what little land they still hold.

AU peacekeepers killed in Somalia, Islamists vow more attacks
He said two suicide bombers -- one in a vehicle and another wearing an explosives-packed vest -- infiltrated the AU base at the former Somali National University. "Go home, otherwise you will meet our hell," Shabab leader Muktar Robow warned AU troops while speaking by telephone to reporters after the attack. Insurgents from the Shabab militia, which claims links to Al Qaeda, took responsibility and vowed to continue assaults against AU soldiers who have been helping shore up Somalia's shaky transitional government. NAIROBI, KENYA — A suicide car bomb attack against African Union peacekeepers in Somalia on Sunday killed 11 Burundian soldiers and wounded 15, the deadliest attack against AU troops since their deployment two years ago. Hundreds of displaced people are living around the campus, and one witness said he saw two civilians among the dead. "I saw a four-wheel-drive car driving at a high speed and then heard a massive explosion," said Kalid Ali Nur, a civilian. "They are trying to destabilize the situation and take away attention from the good news," said Susannah Price, a spokeswoman for the U.N.'s special representative to Somalia. The attack comes as the AU and United Nations are struggling to boost the number of peacekeepers in Somalia from the current level of about 3,500 Burundian and Ugandan soldiers. AU troops have been subject to increased attacks since Ethiopian soldiers withdrew from the country in January. Newly appointed Somali President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, a former leader of the Islamist alliance that once included Shabab, has been calling upon his former partners to join the government, which was expanded in January to incorporate a major Islamist faction.

Al-Shabaab and AU peacekeepers clash in Somalia
(Adds U.N. Security Council statement, aid appeal, details)  By Abdi Sheikh and Abdi Guled  MOGADISHU, Feb 25 Islamist rebels battled African Union (AU) peacekeepers and Somali police for a second day on Wednesday, taking the death toll in the worst fighting for weeks to 81, witnesses and a rights group said. The local Elman Peace and Human Rights group said 48 civilians had been killed and 90 wounded since early Tuesday. Witnesses said at least 15 Islamist fighters and six policemen were also killed in exchanges of gunfire and mortar bombs that have rocked the coastal capital for two days. The latest violence flared just days after new President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed returned to the coastal city to form an inclusive unity government, the 15th attempt in 18 years to bring peace to the failed Horn of Africa state. In New York, the U.N. Security Council issued a unanimous statement to "condemn in the strongest terms the attacks on the African Union mission in Somalia" and urged all Somalis "to reject violence and extremism." Hardline al Shabaab Islamist gunmen, who have been battling his administration and a 3,500-strong AU peace mission based in the capital, also seized the southcentral town of Hudur from pro-government militias after a short battle Wednesday. "Al Shabaab fighters are now patrolling the town and the other group fled," local elder Hussein Abdi Isak told Reuters by phone from Hudur. He said at least 18 combatants had died. More than 16,000 civilians have been killed in the two-year-old insurgency, one million people have been driven from their homes, more than a third of the population depend on aid, and large parts of Mogadishu lie empty and destroyed. Some say it could overrun the government, while others say it has only a few thousand fighters and has used the media and high profile strikes to project a more powerful image, despite waning support among traditionally moderate Somali Muslims.

Airplane crashes at Schiphol Airport; 9 killed
Advertisement A Turkish Airlines plane has crashed on landing at Amsterdam's Schiphol international airport, killing nine people and injuring 84, six critically. The plane, carrying 127 passengers and seven crew, crashed short of the runway near the A9 highway. It broke into three pieces, but did not catch fire. Three of those killed are crew members. Dutch officials say most of the passengers on board were Turkish. The Boeing 737-800 aircraft came down at 1031 local time (0931 GMT), several hundred yards (metres) short of the runway. At a news conference in Amsterdam, officials confirmed that all the bodies had been removed from the plane.

Obama budget calls for record US deficit
By Karen Nye Business reporter, BBC News, New York President Barack Obama's first budget demonstrates a clear change in direction from the previous administration. President Obama will give more details of his budget in April As promised on the campaign trail, and despite the recession, he wants to increase spending on education, healthcare and the environment and pay for much of that by shifting the tax burden to wealthy Americans. Critics on the right say he is engaging in class warfare, but he says it is just a fairer approach, following eight years when the playing field was tilted towards those with the most resources. By letting the tax cuts sponsored by President George W. Bush expire, billions of dollars in revenues will suddenly be available. At the other end of the scale, the new budget gives more tax breaks to lower and middle income Americans. Healthcare for all Going through the numbers, the new president's stated priorities of education, healthcare and the environment garner spending increases through many different departments and programmes. Education dollars are directed primarily towards two areas: early childhood education, which many educators believe is crucial to later success, and university education, which more and more jobs require. The budget also increases money for basic science research, saying Americans should not fall behind other countries. New government spending on healthcare includes more than $600bn (£419bn) set aside over 10 years for unspecified purposes, but aimed at eventually providing healthcare for all Americans, a goal not shared by everyone. Traditionally proponents of the free market, Americans have been conditioned to distrust anything that smacks of "socialism", but as millions of people join the list of uninsured each year, and employer-provided healthcare becomes more costly and covers less, people in the middle agree that the current, mostly private, healthcare system is not working well.

Former Serbian president Milutinovic acquitted of war crimes
Serbian ex-President Milan Milutinovic has been acquitted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Kosovo by a UN war crimes tribunal. Five former top Serbian officials were found guilty on some or all the charges relating to the 1990s conflict. Their sentences range from 15 to 22 years. It was the court's first ruling on alleged crimes committed by Serbian forces in the breakaway region. Mr Milutinovic was seen largely as a figurehead president during that time. The court found that the 66-year-old, who led Serbia from December 1997 to December 2002, had no direct control over the Yugoslav army. UN TRIBUNAL SENTENCES Nikola Sainovic - 22 years Nebojsa Pavkovic - 22 years Sreten Lukic - 22 years Vladimir Lazarevic - 15 years Dragoljub Ojdanic - 15 years  Summary of judgment [137KB] Judge Iain Bonomy pointed the finger at then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, saying: "In practice, it was Milosevic, sometimes termed the 'Supreme Commander', who exercised actual command authority over the [Serb army] during the Nato campaign." In the late 1990s, Milosevic's forces were attempting to suppress the ethnic Albanian majority's independence campaign in Kosovo. The region, under UN control after Nato drove out Serb forces in 1999, unilaterally declared independence from Serbia a year ago. Mr Milutinovic and his fellow defendants at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) - all of whom had been allies of Milosevic - had denied all the charges against them.

Afghan protestors shot after mosque raid sparks anger
GHAZNI, Afghanistan Feb 27 Six people were hurt when Afghan police opened fire on demonstrators who claimed U.S. troops had desecrated a Koran during a raid on a mosque. The incident took place in Deh Khodaidad village in Ghazni, southwest of the capital, Kabul. Police said a government team had been sent to investigate claims that foreign troops had raided the mosque, rounded up worshippers and tore apart copies of the Koran on Thursday night. A spokesman for the U.S. military said he was aware of a "peaceful protest". Afghanistan has seen a series of violent protests in recent years over reports of insults to Islam. More than 74,000 foreign troops operate under NATO and U.S. military's command in Afghanistan, fighting the al Qaeda-backed Taliban. Investigation launched One of the protesters told the Associated Press that he was in the mosque when troops entered and opened fire, although no-one was injured. At least two bullets hit the door of the mosque, said Kazim Allayar, deputy provincial governor, during a visit to the site of the alleged incident. Government officials will meet with Polish forces on Saturday to find out if they were involved, he said. Civilian deaths Robert Rochowicz, a spokesman for Poland's defence ministry, said he had "no information at all about any kind of incident concerning Polish troops in Afghanistan".

REUTERS/Mohammed Ameen CAMP LEJEUNE, North Carolina President Barack Obama said on Friday he would end U.S. combat operations in Iraq in 18 months but leave up to 50,000 troops there to provide stability, a decision that riled Democrats who favored a larger withdrawal. "We are leaving Iraq to its people, and we have begun the work of ending this war," Obama said in an address to Marines almost six years after U.S.-led forces toppled Saddam Hussein in a vain hunt for weapons of mass destruction. Congressional Democrats who fought the Bush administration for two years to bring home U.S. forces home expressed disappointment, with Senate leader Harry Reid saying 50,000 troops was "higher than I had anticipated" and Representative Lynn Woolsey calling it "unacceptable." "Such a large number can only be viewed by the Iraqi public as an enduring occupation force," Woolsey said. "So long as the U.S. is viewed as an occupier, the Iraqis will be unable to achieve the necessary unification, reconciliation, and further democratization efforts that will be required for them to bring long-term stability to the country." The 18-month timetable marks a historic juncture in a war that has been enormously costly to the United States and defined the presidency of George W. Bush. Winding down the Iraq war will allow Obama to boost troop numbers in Afghanistan, which he has declared the central front in the U.S. fight against terrorism. Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end," Obama said to scattered applause from an audience of about 2,000 Marines at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.

The BBC's Barbara Plett, in Islamabad, says accounts suggest the attack was sophisticated in nature, with one group of gunmen firing a rocket-propelled grenade in order to create a diversion, while others then approached, firing guns on the convoy. She says the gunmen - two of whom were shown in TV pictures carrying backpacks - seemed to be well-trained.

Ten dead in Alabama shooting
(CNN) -- At least 10 people were killed Tuesday in a shooting spree that spanned two small southern Alabama towns, state officials confirmed. The gunman, who turned the gun on himself, and the wife and child of a sheriff's deputy were among those killed. An ambulance rushes to the scene of a multiple shooting in Samson, Alabama, on Tuesday afternoon. The shooting started in a neighborhood in Samson, a town of about 3,000 about 15 miles north of the Florida border, just after 4 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) and ended 12 miles away at a manufacturing plant in Geneva, said Alabama state Sen. Harri Anne Smith, who represents Geneva County. "He was shooting at just ordinary people going about their business," Smith told CNN, saying she had been briefed by state and local law enforcement. The gunman, whose identity was not disclosed, shot himself at the Reliable Metal Products plant, state public safety spokesman Kevin Cook told CNN. Authorities are also investigating an arson at a residence in neighboring Coffee County, where a body was found. That incident is thought to be related to the shootings, Cook said. Investigators are trying to determine whether the gunman, who Cook said was armed with a semi-automatic weapon, knew any of the victims. Steve Jarrett told reporters that the gunman killed six adults and one child in three residences in Samson, before heading down state Highway 52, firing at least seven bullets into a state trooper car.

Canadian helicopter with 18 onboard crashes into Atlantic Ocean
Aircraft carrying 18 people was heading to oil platform in strong winds when it plunged into water A helicopter carrying 18 people ditched in the Atlantic ocean off the Canadian coast today. The helicopter was heading to the Hibernia offshore oil platform when it went down off Newfoundland. One person was taken out of the water and ferried to hospital in an ambulance. At least one other person was spotted in the ­water, as well as a life-raft, but there is no sign of the helicopter, said Jeri Grychowski of the rescue co-ordination centre in Halifax. The S-92 Sikorsky helicopter went down 55 miles south-east of the provincial capital of St. John's, where it had picked up oil platform workers. "Mechanical problems were reported, but we don't know the nature," Julie Leroux, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, said. A Hercules aircraft and four Cormorant rescue helicopters were on their way to the site, and a coastguard ship and a supply ship were about an hour away. "We don't have any further information on the raft itself," he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Two people and a raft had been spotted in the ocean waters some 47 nautical miles (54 miles) southeast of Saint Johns, Newfoundland, soon after the crash at 9.18am local time (1248 GMT), she said. The helicopter was ferrying workers to the Hibernia offshore oil platform when it plunged into the ocean, amid strong winds, she said.

Obama administration drops use of term "enemy combatant"
The Obama administration yesterday jettisoned the Bush-era term "enemy combatant" but maintained a broad right to detain those who provide "substantial" assistance to al-Qaeda and its associates around the globe. The disclosure came in a court filing by the Justice Department in response to orders by federal judges, who sought clarity on the government's legal justification for holding about 241 detainees at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Though dropping the term "enemy combatant" was a symbolic break from the Bush administration, the practical effects of yesterday's action will not be known for months. Bush administration officials had long argued they had a broad constitutional power to detain almost any terrorism suspect for an indefinite period. For those at Guantanamo, the government had said it needed to prove only that the detainees were supporting the Taliban, al-Qaeda or associated forces to justify their confinements. The Justice Department said yesterday that it would seek to hold only terrorism suspects who "substantially supported" those groups and not those who "provide unwitting or insignificant support" to al-Qaeda and the Taliban. "The particular facts and circumstances justifying detention will vary from case to case," Justice Department attorneys wrote. "Individuals who provide substantial support to al-Qaida forces in other parts of the world may properly be deemed part of al-Qaida itself," the court papers said. In a statement, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said, "[I]t is essential that we operate in a manner that strengthens our national security, is consistent with our values and is governed by law."

7 killed, 50 injured in Bangladesh shopping mall fire
(Updates death toll)  By Ruma Paul and Anis Ahmed  DHAKA, March 13 A fire engulfed the top floors of Bangladesh's largest shopping mall on Friday, killing at least seven people and injuring dozens, police said, raising questions about the efficiency of safety procedures. Fire fighters, police and other security forces took almost 10 hours to put out the blaze at the 21-storey Basundhara City Complex in Dhaka but found no one trapped inside. Thick smoke rose over the building and flames could be seen on the upper floors, a witness said. Army helicopters rescued people from the roof of the building as members of the Rapid Action Battalion elite force and the army helped stop the blaze. "The fire broke out on the top floor and soon engulfed the other floors," a fire brigade official said. Television pictures showed the blaze spreading through five or six upper floors. The inferno has raised questions about the efficiency of fire fighters and whether the high-rise buildings followed required safety measures, said Tanzim Ahmed Sohel Taj, state minister for home affairs. "We will look at these issues quickly after the current disaster has been tackled," the minister told reporters outside the Basundhara complex. All the dead were Basundhara employees, one from its fire fighting unit and six were security guards, police told reporters. "The firefighter died in a hospital where he was admitted with serious burn injuries," a police officer said. A Basundhara official said the exact death toll and the extent of damage would not be known until the debris was cleared.

Maldives to become the world's first carbon-neutral country
One-third of the Maldives' economy depends on tourism The Maldives will become carbon-neutral within a decade by switching completely to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, its leader has said. President Mohamed Nasheed told the BBC the Maldives understood better than most what would happen if the world failed to tackle climate change. His tiny country is one of the lowest-lying on Earth and so is extremely vulnerable to rises in sea level. He said he hoped his plan would serve as a blueprint for other nations. We start almost from scratch... and it is quite pointless for us to go to yesterday's technologies President Mohamed Nasheed Heightened fears for lowering lands Country profile: The Maldives Mr Nasheed was due to announce the plan formally after the screening of a new film on climate change, The Age of Stupid, on Sunday. The Maldives is made up of a chain of nearly 1,200 islands, most of them uninhabited, which lie off the Indian sub-continent. None of the coral islands measures more than 1.8 metres (six feet) above sea level, making the country vulnerable to a rise in sea levels associated with global warming. 'Starting from scratch' "We understand more than perhaps anyone what would happen to us if we didn't do anything about it or if the rest of the world doesn't find the imagination to confront this problem," Mr Nasheed told Newshour, speaking by telephone from the capital, Male. More from BBC World Service "So basically, we don't want to sit around and blame others, but we want to do whatever we can, and hopefully, if we can become carbon-neutral, and when we come up with the plan, we hope that these plans also will serve as a blueprint for other nations to follow. "We think we can do it, we feel that everyone should be engaged in it, and we don't think that this is an issue that should be taken lightly." It is estimated that the Maldives, which has high levels of poverty, will need to spend about $110m a year to make the transition to renewable energy sources. Asked how it could afford this, the president said the country was already spending similar sums on existing energy sources, and he expected to recover the extra cost within the decade. "We start almost from scratch, we are having to go for new investments in almost all areas and it is quite pointless for us to go to yesterday's technologies," he said.

Coup in Madagascar; opposition leader backs army
The president, who was sheltering in another palace about 6 miles away, has resisted growing pressure to resign over the crisis in the Indian Ocean island in which at least 135 people have been killed. Gunfire and explosions rang out as tanks and dozens of soldiers burst into the palace grounds. Mr Rajoelina had earlier called for security forces to arrest Mr Ravalomanana, who has offered a referendum on whether he should stay. The president has been accused of misspending public funds and undermining democracy. Mr Rajoelina declared himself president of a transitional government over the weekend and promised new presidential elections within two years. Tensions have been rising on the island since late January, when the government blocked an opposition radio station's signal. Opposition supporters set fire to a building in the government broadcasting complex as well as an oil depot, a shopping mall and a private TV station linked to Mr Ravalomanana. The incident cost the president much of the support of the armed forces, which blamed him for the order to fire at demonstrators. Although Mr Ravalomanana has lost most of his power base at home, he still enjoys international legitimacy as the nation's elected president. The African Union has appealed to the rivals to negotiate amid warnings from diplomats that aid to the impoverished country is in jeopardy.

US president Obama, Congress call for blocking of executive bonuses at AIG insurance company
Senior White House officials said last night that President Obama did not learn that bonuses worth $165 million were to be paid to executives of American International Group until Thursday, one day before they were issued and two days after his Treasury secretary was informed that the payments were going forward. Obama aides defended Timothy F. Geithner's handling of the situation yesterday, with White House press secretary Robert Gibbs saying the president has "complete confidence" in the Treasury chief. In a letter to congressional leaders last night, Geithner said that in addition to pressing the company on compensation issues, the Treasury Department will deduct an amount equal to the total bonuses paid from a pledged $30 billion commitment to the troubled insurance company. As Geithner and other Obama aides continued to scramble to pull back the bonuses and calm the public furor they sparked, Congress was preparing its own remedies. In what they acknowledged would be an extraordinary move, leading Democrats proposed using the tax code to punish executives at the firm, in which the federal government controls an 80 percent stake, unless those payouts are surrendered voluntarily. Action on the legislation could begin as early as today in the Senate. That tax would also apply to future bonuses awarded, either by AIG or by other firms receiving federal aid. Similar proposals taking shape in the House would target as much as 100 percent of the bonus money, which was distributed Friday to 73 AIG employees in sums ranging from $1 million to $6.4 million, according to New York Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, who provided details of the payments -- although not the identities of specific recipients -- in a letter to House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.). The bonus scandal has inflamed lawmakers in both parties and could have broad repercussions, and lawmakers warned that it could serve as the death knell for further aid to the ailing sector. Obama's budget calls for allocating an additional $750 billion to bail out troubled firms, and his administration had hoped to quietly "wind down" operations at AIG without an excess of intervention from Congress, but both of those ambitions could be in doubt after the explosion of attention drawn by the bonuses. But they rebuked Geithner for not stopping the bonuses, and they made it clear that further requests for aid would be rejected out of hand.

Madagascar President resigns, unclear rule in Antananarivo
ADDIS ABABA The African Union warned on Tuesday it would take firm measures against Madagascar if the situation in the Indian Ocean island deteriorated and called for the constitution to be respected. "We remind (you of) our commitment to the respect of the constitutional order, especially in the succession of the president," Bruno Zidouemba, Burkina Faso's envoy to Ethiopia and the African Union, told reporters. "The AU council will be firm in the measures to be taken if the situation becomes worse than it is today. If the military takes over, it will be a coup d'etat," he said after an emergency meeting of the AU Peace and Security Council. "The council heard the succession of the presidency is being discussed in Madagascar, but we do not know the outcome." ((Jerome Delay/Associated Press)) Just hours after Madagascar's president handed over power to military leaders on Tuesday, they ceded control to his political rival. Ramaroson said he and two other top generals rejected a move by the president to transfer his power to a military directorate. Any assumption of power by non-constitutional means would be considered a coup d'etat, the union's senior diplomat, Jean Ping, told Reuters on Tuesday. Earlier on Tuesday, also in a radio address, President Marc Ravalomanana told his country he had decided to step down "after deep reflection."

REUTERS/Jim Young WASHINGTON The U.S. House of Representatives swiftly passed a bill on Thursday to recoup controversial bonuses paid to American International Group Inc as Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner tried to calm the furor by taking responsibility. The number two Republican in the Senate, Jon Kyl of Arizona, blocked an initial bid to approve a Senate version of the legislation that would put a 70 percent excise tax on bonuses for employees at companies that have received at least $100 million in bailout aid. Kyl objected to a request to agree by unanimous consent to pass it, saying more study was needed and putting into question when the Senate might again try to pass the legislation. 'BUBBLE AND BUST' President Barack Obama urged lawmakers to press on with measures that he can sign into law, calling AIG bonuses a symptom of "a bubble and bust economy that valued reckless speculation over responsibility and hard work." In response to questions, Geithner said Treasury staff had expressed concern that provisions originally in the bill that would have prevented bonus payments might not survive a legal challenge. The U.S. Treasury chief, who has come under criticism for not doing more to stop the AIG bonuses, repeated he only learned "the full scale and scope of these specific bonus problems" on March 10 and conceded he was partly at fault.

New findings suggest AIG executive bonuses were larger than previously thought
The US bailed out AIG, in effect judging it too large to fail US insurance giant AIG paid out a total of $218m (£150m) in bonuses after accepting bail-out cash, according to a senior US official. Documents obtained by Connecticut's attorney general showed AIG's payout was $53m, or 32%, more than was previously estimated. Papers obtained by subpoena showed 73 people got more than $1m each while five received more than $4m. The US rescued AIG with bail-out funds totalling $170bn since September 2008. But revelations about the size of bonus payments made by the organisation since the bail-out was agreed have sparked a furious reaction among US lawmakers and the general public. 'Distasteful' For much of the week the total amount AIG paid out in bonuses was reported at $165m.

AIG has made no comment on Mr Blumenthal's findings. He said the newly-revealed number would "further fuel the justified anger and revulsion that people feel", and he planned to ask AIG bosses to explain the discrepancies in bonus figures, AP reported. "Unless the number can be explained, it will undercut any lingering rationale the company may have for these unjustified payments," Mr Blumenthal said.

Plane crashes in Montana, 17 killed
The plane crashed close to the town airport A plane has crashed in the northern US state of Montana, killing at least 16 people on board, officials say. The light aircraft went down in a cemetery as it approached the airport in the town of Butte. The pilot was flying from Oroville, California, when he diverted to Butte, the FAA said. He tried to land but crashed 500ft (150m) from the airport. At a news conference, FAA officials said the plane crashed in a cemetery close to the airport in cloudy weather conditions, John Emeigh, a reporter for The Montana Standard newspaper, told the BBC. There were no survivors on board the plane, the FAA said. 'Nosedive' Reports suggest the pilot had filed a flight plan showing a destination of Bozeman, a ski destination about 85 miles (136km) southeast of Butte. But the pilot cancelled his flight plan at some point and diverted for Butte, FAA spokesman Mike Fergus said. "We think that it was probably a ski trip for the kids," Mr Fergus told the Associated Press news agency.

Japanese ship escapes after pirates open fire in Somalia
TOKYO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pirates on Sunday fired on a cargo ship operated by Japan's Mitsui O.S.K. Lines in the waters 900 km east off Somalia, local media reported on Monday, citing the transport ministry. None of the 18 crew members aboard, all Philippine nationals, were wounded when pirates in two boats fired on the ship at around10:00 p.m. Tokyo time (1300 GMT), hitting the windows and ceiling of the steering room. The ship, carrying cargoes of cars en route to Mombasa, a seaport in Southeastern Kenya, got clear of the pirates some 40 minutes later. Lines (9104.T) was shot at by two pirate ships off Somalia, but none of the 18 Filipino crew were injured, the company said on Monday. The incident, which occured on Sunday, came after the Japanese government earlier this month ordered two naval vessels to join international patrols aimed at curbing pirate attacks off Somalia. [ID:nT327928] "Some windows were broken, and there was some damage to the outside of the ship, but no one was injured," a spokeswoman for Mitsui O.S.K. "After zigzagging across the sea for about 40 minutes very fast, the ship tore itself away from the boats," she added. The company said in a statement that the ship was a Cayman Islands-flagged cargo ship transporting used cars from the United Arab Emirates to Kenya. Despite the damage, the ship could operate and is currently sailing towards a safer area. (CNN) -- Pirates attacked a Japanese cargo ship off the coast of Somalia on Sunday, a Japanese Transportation Ministry official said.

Dam in Indonesia bursts, dozens killed
Advertisement A dam has burst south-west of the Indonesian capital Jakarta, killing at least 58 people. Witnesses said a "horrifying" flash flood of water up to 4m (13ft) deep engulfed hundreds of homes in Cirendeu in the Tangerang district. Officials say they expect the death toll to rise, and 150 body bags have been sent to the scene. An official said the Situ Gintung lake behind the dam became overloaded after hours of heavy rain. "The dam was an old dam, 16m (52ft) deep," said Ratu Atut Chosiyah, governor of Banten province, where the lake is located. "Last night, because of heavy rain, the dam could not hold back the water so it broke," she added. 'Still sleeping' The incident happened at about 0200 local time (1900 GMT) in what is a popular tourist area. A surge of water laden with debris slammed into the suburb of small, poorly built houses, sweeping away cars and toppling telephone lines.

UN agency condemns new Afghan "Shia family law"
Afghanistan's President, Hamid Karzai, has signed a law which "legalises" rape, women's groups and the United Nations warn. Critics claim the president helped rush the bill through parliament in a bid to appease Islamic fundamentalists ahead of elections in August. In a massive blow for women's rights, the new Shia Family Law negates the need for sexual consent between married couples, tacitly approves child marriage and restricts a woman's right to leave the home, according to UN papers seen by The Independent. "It is one of the worst bills passed by the parliament this century," fumed Shinkai Karokhail, a woman MP who campaigned against the legislation. The law regulates personal matters like marriage, divorce, inheritance and sexual relations among Afghanistan's minority Shia community. The provisions are reminiscent of the hardline Taliban regime, which banned women from leaving their homes without a male relative. The bill lay dormant for more than a year, but in February it was rushed through parliament as President Karzai sought allies in a constitutional row over the upcoming election. "They accused me of being an unbeliever," she said.

Asian countries call for global currency
A single clause in Point 19 of the communiqué issued by the G20 leaders amounts to revolution in the global financial order. "We have agreed to support a general SDR allocation which will inject $250bn (£170bn) into the world economy and increase global liquidity," it said. SDRs are Special Drawing Rights, a synthetic paper currency issued by the International Monetary Fund that has lain dormant for half a century. In effect, the G20 leaders have activated the IMF's power to create money and begin global "quantitative easing". In doing so, they are putting a de facto world currency into play. Its fighting fund for crises is to be tripled overnight to $750bn. Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the managing director, said in February that the world was "already in Depression" and risked a slide into social disorder and military conflict unless political leaders resorted to massive stimulus. While Gordon Brown talked of $5 trillion in global stimulus by 2010, this is mostly made up of packages already under way.

13 killed in U.S. air strike in Pakistan
Local officials in North Waziristan, near the Afghan border, said the dead included women and children as well as militants - some of them foreigners. The US military does not routinely confirm drone attacks, but US forces in Afghanistan are believed to be the only ones in the region with the capability. Pakistan is critical of drone use because, it says, civilians are often killed, fuelling support for militants. Retaliation threatened Local administration officials say the missiles destroyed part of a house owned by a school teacher in a village near the region's main town of Miranshah. A number of foreign militants were among those killed in the strike at 0300 local (2200 Friday), security officials said. Dozens of suspected drone strikes have killed hundreds in recent months The spokesman said the Taleban held Pakistan responsible for the strike, adding that it should be ready for retaliation. The latest incident comes only three days after a missile fired by a suspected US drone killed at least 14 people in Pakistan's Orakzai tribal area, near the Afghan border.

North Korea launches rocket
North Korea's neighbours have strongly condemned the rocket launch North Korea has defied international warnings and gone ahead with a controversial rocket launch. State media said a satellite had been put into orbit and was transmitting data and revolutionary songs. But there has been no independent confirmation so far. The US, Japan and South Korea suspect the launch was a cover for a long-range missile test. The US president told Pyongyang to "refrain from further provocative actions". "This provocation underscores the need for action - not just this afternoon at the UN Security Council, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons." Japan called the move "extremely regrettable", while South Korea said it constituted a clear breach of a United Nations resolution. The UN Security Council has approved a Japanese request for an emergency session. Washington, Tokyo and Seoul regard the launch as a clear violation of Security Council resolution 1718 adopted in October 2006, which bans North Korea from carrying out ballistic missile activity. No intercept North Korea announced several weeks ago that it planned to send what it called an "experimental communications satellite" into space from the Musudan-ri launch site in the north-east.

18-year US media ban on covering return of fallen soldiers lifted
For the first time since the Obama administration reversed an 18-year-old ban on news coverage of returning fallen soldiers, the military allowed media to cover the arrival tonight of an airman killed in Afghanistan. Phillip A. Myers, a 30-year-old supporting Operation Enduring Freedom, at Dover Air Force Base at 11 p.m. today marked the first time that the transfer of any of the nearly 5,000 U.S. troops who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan was open to the media. Play The transfer of the flag-draped casket was carried out with great dignity, for the seven family members present. One of the men present dabbed his eyes with a tissue. After a prayer was said by a chaplain, Maj. Klabens Noel, a carry team of eight airmen and women wearing battle dress uniforms with white gloves moved Myers' flag-draped casket from an Atlas Air 747 cargo jet to a waiting panel truck. In the cool night, under a light breeze, the only noise was the hum of the jet's auxiliary power unit, until the quiet was pierced by the engine of the lift lowering the casket from the jet to the tarmac. The eight airmen and women carried the casket to a white panel truck, placed it inside, as the doors were slowly closed, the call went out for present arms. About 40 members of the media were present, and throughout the transfer there were no flashes, no talking, though cameras clicked as casket went by. Myers, from Hopewell, Va., died April 4 of wounds suffered from an improvised explosive device, the Air Force said in a statement.

5.6-magnitude aftershock earthquake strikes Italy
Rescuers continued searching for survivors though the night after a powerful aftershock brought two apartment blocks crashing down in the stricken city of L'Aquila, killing one person and causing panic among rescue workers and survivors of Monday's deadly earthquake. Chunks of masonry fell from other damaged buildings, including parts of the basilica, and the tremor - measured by the US Geological Survey at magnitude 5.6 - was felt as far away as Rome. Within minutes the city resounded again to the scream of sirens as police and rescue workers rushed to the scene. Meanwhile, rescue workers were preparing to carry out what one called a "surgical operation" on a collapsed building in the centre of L'Aquila in the hope of saving the lives of four missing students as the overall death toll reached at least 235. Sergio Basti, the Rome fire brigade engineer leading the attempt, said his team aimed to demolish the residence where the students were trapped "bit by bit from the top, like scraping toppings from a pizza". The students' residence has been a focus of the rescue operation since early on Monday, shortly after the earthquake that devastated the city and several of the surrounding towns and villages. The operation was decided on after rescue workers fixed the location of the four students inside the shattered building. But Basti warned: "We do not know whether they are dead or alive." The relatives had spent much of the day waiting anxiously, and sometimes tearfully, outside the building among reporters, police and firefighters. It was the prelude to a day in which the death toll in and around L'Aquila surged higher and the balance shifted perceptibly away from the hope of finding more survivors and towards a more exigent calculation of the risks facing the rescuers. Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, told a press conference in L'Aquila that the search for the living would go on for another 48 hours.

Election in Moldova instigates rioting mob demanding recount
Some of those protesting on Tuesday bore the Romanian flag Moldova's president has accused neighbouring Romania of stoking the protests that erupted into violence in the capital Chisinau on Tuesday. Romania has rejected the accusation as a "provocation". Thousands of young protesters thronged Chisinau, fighting police and ransacking parliament, in protest at the results of Sunday's election. Official results gave the ruling Communists about 50% of the vote in the Romanian-speaking ex-Soviet republic. International observers said the vote appeared to have been fair, though one told the BBC she had her doubts. Some of my colleagues went in and later said they smashed everything and put the president's chair and portrait on fire Alina Martiniuc Resident of Chisinau Eyewitness: Moldova protests What is behind unrest? Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin, a Communist, was quoted by Russian agency Interfax saying: "We know that certain political forces in Romania are behind this unrest. The Romanian flags fixed on the government buildings in Chisinau attest to this." Earlier the president described the violence as "a coup d'etat". Some of the protesters on Tuesday had carried Romanian flags and called for the unification of Moldova with Romania, its bigger neighbour. Russia's foreign ministry said there was a plot aimed at undermining "the sovereignty of Moldova". But Romania's foreign ministry said: "This accusation is a provocation aimed at the Romanian state."

American captain freed from Somali pirates
In a daring high-seas rescue, U.S. Navy SEAL snipers killed three Somali pirates and freed the American sea captain who had offered himself as a hostage to save his crew. The operation was a victory for the world's most powerful military but angry pirates vowed Monday to retaliate. Those threats raised fears for the safety of some 230 foreign sailors still held hostage in more than a dozen ships anchored off the coast of lawless Somalia. "From now on, if we capture foreign ships and their respective countries try to attack us, we will kill them (the hostages)," Jamac Habeb, a 30-year-old pirate, told the Associated Press from one of Somalia's piracy hubs, Eyl. "(U.S. forces have) become our No. Richard Phillips' rescue caused his crew in Kenya to break into wild cheers and brought tears to the eyes of those in Phillips' hometown of Underhill, Vt., half a world away from the Indian Ocean drama. She said she is proud of her husband and thanks everyone for giving her "the strength to be strong for Richard." In a sharp warning to pirates off Somalia, Obama added: "I want to be very clear that we are resolved to halt the rise of piracy in that region and to achieve that goal, we're going to have to continue to work with our partners to prevent future attacks." "We have to continue to be prepared to confront them when they arise, and we have to ensure that those who commit acts of piracy are held accountable for their crimes," the president said.

Peruvian rebels kill thirteen soldiers
The army has been pursuing rebels in the Ayacucho region Peru's Shining Path rebels have killed 13 soldiers in two ambushes in the south-east of the country, the country's defence minister says. Antero Flores Araoz said the rebels had used dynamite and grenades to attack one military patrol on Thursday. A captain and 11 soldiers died in that attack which left two other soldiers wounded and one is still missing. It is one of the deadliest operations by the once-formidable guerrillas in the past decade. Mr Flores said the incidents had taken place on Thursday, but news had been delayed by poor communications with the region. "Most of the soldiers plunged over a cliff," he added, without giving further details. Prime Minister Yehude Simon condemned the ambushes as "desperate responses by the Shining Path in the face of advances by the armed forces". Last year, the Shining Path sprang back from relative obscurity to launch a series of deadly attacks, killing some 25 soldiers and police officers in ambushes and gun battles. But the group is believed to be a fraction of its former size and is split between two cocaine-producing zones of Peru, some 500km (310 miles) apart. It is made up of a few hundred guerrillas who did not lay down their arms when the group's leader, Abimael Guzman, declared the armed revolution at an end after his capture in 1992. Its fighters are considered expert in guerrilla warfare from years of resistance in some of Peru's remotest and wildest country and are well-armed from the profits of the cocaine trade.

Afghanistan women protest Shia Family Law
Women marching against new legislation which effectively legalises rape met violent opposition from an opposing mob in Kabul yesterday. Dozens of riot police, backed by more than 50 elite counter-terrorism officers, struggled to keep the groups apart as hordes of men charged at the protesters, who had taken to the streets near Afghanistan's parliament. At one point the women , who were marching to parliament to deliver a petition, were pelted with stones. Men chanted "long live Islam" and spat at the women who had assembled outside a mosque built by Ayatollah Mohseni, the Shia cleric who helped draft the law. At a separate demonstration, police fired into the air to disperse a mob surrounding a school accused of organising the protests. The legislation restricts a woman's right to leave her home and demands she submit to her husband's sexual desires. Sima Ghani, one of the women's organisers, said: "This law is against Islam and it's against women. The UN has warned that a number of women have already received death threats for speaking out against the Shia Family Law, which President Hamid Karzai signed last month. "But these men are claiming those rights in the name of culture.

The attack was condemned as a "cowardly act of terrorism" in a statement from the office of Yousuf Raza Gilani, the prime minister, which added that the government would use an "iron hand" against opposition fighters. The checkpoint is near the Orakzai tribal region in Pakistan, which has emerged in recent months as stronghold for pro-Taliban fighters who have stepped up their battle against the government. Western nations are pressing Pakistan to take greater action against pro-Taliban forces and al-Qaeda elements in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan.

Scientist Stephen Hawking rushed to hospital in ambulance
Professor Stephen Hawking, one of the world's most famous scientists, is "very ill" in hospital, Cambridge University said today. Professor Hawking, who works at the university, was undergoing tests at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. A university spokesman said the 67-year-old physicist, who is best known for his book A Brief History of Time, was taken to Addenbrooke's by ambulance. "Professor Hawking is very ill," he added. Professor Hawking suffers from motor neurone disease and is wheelchair bound. He speaks with the help of a voice synthesiser. He developed symptoms of the disease while studying in the 1960s and is one of the world's longest surviving sufferers. He has worked at Cambridge's Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics for more than 30 years and since 1979 has been the University's Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. Professor Hawking was awarded a CBE in 1982, became a Companion of Honour in 1989 and is a Fellow of the Royal Society. One of Professor Hawking's last public appearances was last September when he unveiled a £1 million clock erected at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. "Professor Hawking is very ill and has today been taken by ambulance to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge," said the University spokesman.

Darling announces UK budget for 2009
Critics say that the chancellor is being over-optimistic in his anticipation that the economy would grow by 3.5% in 2011 and continue to grow at 3%-plus in the next two years. City economists poured scorn on Treasury forecasts that Britain will rapidly bounce back from its weakest one-year performance since 1945 to record a sustained period of rapid growth from 2011. Despite being forced to downgrade his growth expectations for this year to show a 3.5% drop in gross domestic product, Alistair Darling said he expected the UK to start expanding again by the end of the year and record a 1.25% expansion next year. But the chancellor was accused of being over-optimistic in his anticipation that a mini-investment boom and the boost to exports from a weaker pound would lead to growth of 3.5% in 2011 and continue to grow at 3%-plus in the next two years. Darling told MPs that the 1.6% contraction in the economy in the final three months of 2008 would be repeated in the first quarter of 2009. GDP is expected to decline at an annual rate of 4% in the first half of this year but the chancellor said the recession had done little long-term damage to the economy, which would eventually return to a trend rate of growth of 2.75%. Nick Parsons, head of strategy at NAB Capital said: "These numbers are astonishing for growth. They are totally unrealistic, both because lower levels of consumption by both businesses and individuals will reduce the trend rate of growth and because it is highly unlikely that the economy could grow above trend for so long. It is the growth forecasts that allow him to get the budget deficit and debt down." Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said: "We believe that these forecasts are mildly optimistic in the near term and much more optimistic in the long term."

Four bombings over two days leave more than 130 dead in Iraq
The two attacks killed nearly 100 people and left dozens more wounded [EPA] The blast in central Baghdad took place as a group of policemen were distributing relief supplies to Iraqis who had been driven from their homes during the sectarian bloodshed that followed the 2003 US-led invasion. "It is a suicide bomber. Obviously that has the fingerprints of al-Qaeda," Major-General Qassim Moussawi, a Baghdad security spokesman, said. A medic at the nearby Ibn al-Nafis hospital said that five children and a woman were confirmed dead at the hospital. Pilgrims targeted Christopher Hill, right, takes up his new posting amid increasing violence in Iraq [Reuters] The second attack occurred near Muqdadiya, 80km from Baghdad, in the northeastern province of Diyala. The suicide bomber appeared to have targeted a group of Iranian pilgrims in a restaurant. Most of the 64 dead are believed to be Iranians visiting Shia Muslim religious sites in Iraq, police said. The attacks were the latest in a series of bombings that have raised fears of a surge in violence as the US military plans for a full withdrawal by the end of 2011. Security has improved measurably in Iraq over the past two years, but attacks targeting the police are still common in some parts of the country, including the capital. The group is one of a handful of Sunni Arab groups blamed for suicide bombings and other attacks in the northern city of Mosul and other parts of Iraq.

Outbreak of swine flu in Mexico kills at least twenty, infects 1,000
Scores of public buildings were closed in Mexico City in a bid to contain the illness [AFP] Scores of public buildings were closed in Mexico City in a bid to contain the illness [AFP] Initial reports from the WHO said that up to 60 people had died in Mexico from the disease, and Cordova said 40 deaths were being "analysed" for the disease. US officials said the White House was closely following the outbreak in the United States and Barack Obama, the president, has been informed. The officials said the virus in the United States was a never-before-seen mixture of viruses typical among pigs, birds and humans. Armando Ahued, Mexico City's health minister, said a massive vaccination campaign was being launched against the illness. Al Jazeera's Franc Contreras in Mexico City said the authorities had advised people not to go outside unless necessary and that many residents had bought surgical masks in attempt to avoid the disease. Pandemic fears The WHO, which has identified swine influenza as a potential source of a human flu pandemic, said it had activated its global epidemic operations centre, which oversees acute public health events in response to the crisis. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said the A/H1N1 influenza identified in at least two of the recent cases by US counterparts could develop into a pandemic-type virus. Human outbreaks of H1N1 swine influenza virus were recorded in the US in 1976 and 1988, when two deaths were recorded, and also in 1986, while in 1988 a pregnant woman died after contact with sick pigs, the WHO said. In recent years the global focus for a possible pandemic has shifted to the H5N1 bird flu virus, which has spread from poultry to humans and killed 257 of the 421 people infected by the virus since 2003.

At least 71 deaths in Mexico 'likely linked' to swine flu outbreak
Without that knowledge — which is unlikely to emerge soon because only two laboratories, in Atlanta and Winnipeg, Canada, can confirm a case — his agency’s panel of experts was unwilling to raise the global pandemic alert level, even though it officially saw the outbreak as a public health emergency and opened its emergency response center.

The hurricane may not actually hit.” American investigators said they expected more cases here, but noted that virtually all so far had been mild and urged Americans not to panic.

Icelandic centre-left coalition secures majority in parliamentary elections
A leftwing coalition won Iceland's general election, according to final results released today. The results were an overwhelming rejection of the pro-business Independence party that many blamed for the collapse of the country's banking system. Results showed that the leftwing coalition made up of the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left Green Movement won 34 out of 63 parliamentary seats. All five constituencies completed the count with 97.9% of the votes tallied. The Social Democrats won 30.5% of the vote, or 20 parliamentary seats, while the Left-Green Movement won 21.5%, or 14 seats. Both parties have long said they will form a coalition government. The two parties formed part of a caretaker government that took office in February after public protests about Iceland's economic collapse toppled the previous conservative administration. Voter turnout was just over 85%, slightly higher than in the 2007 elections. The conservative Independence party had held a parliamentary majority for some 70 years. Although it won 23.7% of the vote, many blamed its leaders for the country's economic troubles. After racking up massive debts during years of laissez-faire economic regulation and rapid expansion, Iceland's three main banks collapsed within the space of a week in October. The government has sought a $10bn (£6.8bn) International Monetary Fund-led bailout, but the country's currency, the krona, has plummeted. Unemployment and inflation have spiralled and the IMF has predicted that the economy will shrink by about 10% in 2009, which would be Iceland's biggest slump since it won full independence from Denmark in 1944.

French tourists killed in California bus rollover accident
A tour bus carrying French travellers crashed on a highway overpass in the central California city of Soledad on Tuesday, killing at least five people and injuring dozens, police said. A total of 36 people had been on board, including 34 French tourists, one Canadian tour guide and an American driver, California Highway Patrol spokesman Brian Wiest said. The crash ejected four passengers from the vehicle, sending one over the side of the road and onto railroad tracks about 20 metres below, Wiest said. Maia Carroll, a spokeswoman for the Monterey County Office of Emergency Services, said there were at least five confirmed deaths — three at the scene, including the passenger who fell to the railroad tracks, and two who later died at hospitals. Authorities haven't released the names of the deceased or injured people. She said the hospital had been told to expect more patients. The Orion Pacific bus was left lying on its side, while luggage and clothing were strewn across the road. "At this time, it appears to just be a solo-vehicle incident, meaning just the tour bus itself was involved," Wiest said. Officials with Orion Pacific, a California charter coach company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The French consulate in San Francisco confirmed it had been told travellers from France were on board, but it didn't have any more details.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter to retire
Supreme Court Justice David Souter poses for an official picture with other justices at the Supreme Court, October 31, 2005. REUTERS/Jason Reed WASHINGTON U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter announced on Friday he will resign, and President Barack Obama said he wanted someone with a sharp, independent mind for his first appointment to the nation's highest court. Souter, 69, who has been on the court since 1990, said in a brief letter to the White House that he intended to retire when the justices go on their summer recess at the end of next month. Minutes later, Obama made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room after speaking to Souter and said: "I am incredibly grateful for his dedicated service. I told him as much when we spoke." Souter's retirement plans, which leaked out late on Thursday, sparked a frenzy of speculation about Obama's search for a replacement, although the transition is unlikely to change the nine-member court's ideological balance. Souter usually sides with the court's three other liberal justices. I will seek someone who understands that justice isn't just about some abstract legal theory or footnote in a casebook," Obama said. With a rare vacancy on the court looming, advocacy groups were already positioning for a possible confirmation battle before the U.S. Senate, which has to give its approval to Obama's nominee. And it is my hope we can swear in our new Supreme Court justice in time for him or her to be seated by the first Monday in October when the court's new term begins," Obama said.

Swine flu worldwide: update
Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement About 300 people at a Hong Kong hotel have been placed under quarantine after a guest there became China's first confirmed swine flu case. The 25-year-old man, who is now in hospital after testing positive for the virus, had travelled from Mexico via Shanghai, Hong Kong's leader said. Local TV footage showed police wearing masks guarding the hotel exits. Meanwhile, the UK joined Canada, Spain, Germany and the US in reporting person-to-person transmission of the virus. On Friday, French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot said two people were infected with swine flu, France's first confirmed cases. South Korea has also confirmed its first case, local media said. The announcements take to 16 the number of countries where swine flu has been confirmed. Mexico, where the outbreak began, has shut down parts of its economy for five days in a bid to curb the virus's progress. Late on Friday, Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova announced the confirmed death toll from the virus had risen by one, to 16. "The mortality rate isn't as great as could be expected," said Mr Cordova. Mexican officials say the spread of swine flu - suspected in more than 380 deaths - is slowing. International experts are more cautious - but one, Nancy Cox, chief of America's Center for Disease Control's influenza division, said the new virus lacked the traits that made the 1918 pandemic so deadly.

Increased turnout, reports of violence at worldwide May Day demonstrations
Police in Berlin arrested 57 people while around 50 officers were hurt as young demonstrators threw bottles and rocks and set fire to cars and rubbish bins. There were also clashes in Hamburg, where anti-capitalist protesters attacked a bank. In Turkey, masked protesters threw stones and petrol bombs at police, smashing banks and supermarket windows in its biggest city, Istanbul. Security forces fired tear gas and water cannon at hundreds of rioters and more than a hundred were arrested with dozens more hurt. There were also scattered skirmishes with police in the capital, Ankara, where 150,000 people marched. The government had declared May Day, traditionally marked by rallies by labour unions, a public holiday this year under pressure from unions. In Greece, officers fired flash grenades to disperse rioters in Athens after attacks on banks and traffic cameras. Transport strikes disrupted bus, train and ferry services as well as flights by Greek carrier Olympic Airlines. Twenty people were injured and five arrested after police clashed with demonstrators at a traditional labour day rally in Linz in northern Austria. The incident came after police intercepted some 50 hooded protesters among a procession of up to 700 people at a Communist Party rally. In France, unions joined forces for the first time since the Second World War, but turnout was not as high as a protest day in March in which up to three million attended 300 rallies against President Nicolas Sarkozy's economic recovery plan. Some politicians have warned of the threat of "revolution", following radical action such as "boss-napping" factory executives and an ongoing strike that has crippled dozens of French universities. They are wary of the growing power of leftist radicals linked to the New Anti-Capitalist Party of Olivier Besancenot, a Trotskyist postman.

Rights group in Afghanistan investigating claim of US use of phosphorus bombs
The US military says its only uses white phosphorous within legal bounds The US military says it has evidence that insurgents in Afghanistan have illegally used white phosphorus ammunition to attack its forces. A military spokesman, Col Greg Julian, said at least 44 incidents of Taleban militants using or storing the weapons had been documented. White phosphorus is allowed in battle to illuminate targets. But it causes severe chemical burns on flesh and cannot legally be used as a weapon against people. A senior doctor, Dr Mohammad Aref Jalali, suggested the chemical might have been used in recent clashes in Farah province between US-led forces and Taleban militants. The US has strongly denied using white phosphorous in Farah province and the spokesman accused the insurgents of blatantly violating the laws of war. 'Unusual' burns "The insurgents possess and use white phosphorus as a weapon against people," said Col Julian. Dr Jalali, head of the burns unit at the Herat Regional Hospital, said they had treated a number of people injured in the clashes in Farah who had what he called unusual burns. The burns appeared to have been caused by a chemical used in a bomb: "The presence of phosphorus is not confirmed, but I see it as probability. It is possible that such bombs may have been used."

American journalist in Iran freed from prison
Advertisement The US-Iranian journalist jailed in Iran, Roxana Saberi, has been freed from prison after having her sentence for spying reduced. Lawyers for Ms Saberi, 31, whose imprisoning sparked a global outcry, said she left Tehran's Evin jail hours after her eight-year term was cut. She will be able to leave the country but has been banned from working as a journalist in Iran for five years. The White House welcomed the release as a "humanitarian gesture". Ms Saberi was convicted of spying for the US in April but denied the charge. The BBC's Tehran correspondent says the charge against her was reduced on appeal to one carrying a lesser sentence. The case sparked international attention and protests calling for Roxana Saberi to be released. US President Barack Obama, who has taken a more conciliatory approach to Iran than his predecessor, was among those who appealed on her behalf. "He was relieved to see that Roxana Saberi has been released," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters. "We know this has been a trying time for her family and friends and he looks forward to welcoming her home to the United States. We want to continue to stress that she was wrongly accused but we welcome this humanitarian gesture."

North Korea conducts test of nuclear weapon
SEOUL, May 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will prevent its civilians from visiting the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, excluding the Kaesong Joint Complex, for safety reasons, starting from Tuesday, the nation's unification ministry said Monday. Unification ministry spokesperson Chun Hae-sung said, "Visits to the North (DPRK) will be banned for the time being due to safety concerns as the country has conducted a nuclear test." South Koreans will be prevented from traveling to the areas near Pyongyang, the DPRK's capital city, and the Mount Kumgang, starting from Tuesday, the spokesperson said. However, people heading for Kaesong for business purposes will still be allowed to cross the border as the Kaesong Joint Complex is still open amid the current political tension, the spokesperson added. Although necessity items will continue being permitted to flow into the country as humanitarian supports are to be maintained, other non-priority facility objects will not be allowed to go into the DPRK, according to the spokesperson. The businesses to engage in inter-Korean trades are accordingly expected to be hurt by the ministry's ban, local media reported. The move came as South Korea's presidential office reported it has detected an "artificial earthquake" in the DPRK, later confirmed by the DPRK as its second nuclear test. The DPRK has recently threatened to conduct another nuclear test after the U.N. Security Council announced in a statement condemning the April 5 rocket launch. ・DPRK said Monday it has successfully conducted "one more" underground nuclear test. ・DPRK: test was "part of the measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defence..." ・The statement did not give any details about the test, including its location.

(Xinhua/Reuters Photo) Photo Gallery>>> In a statement released by the official news agency KCNA, the DPRK government said the test was "part of the measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defence in every way as requested by its scientists and technicians." "The current nuclear test was safely conducted on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control and the results of the test helped satisfactorily settle the scientific and technological problems arising in further increasing the power of nuclear weapons and steadily developing nuclear technology," the statement said.

Trial against Church of Scientology begins in France
By John Lichfield The Scientology movement went on trial in Paris yesterday for "organised fraud" in a case which could lead to the cult's organising bodies being outlawed in France. The French state prosecution service has failed to back the trial but denies that its decision was influenced by the lobbying of French politicians, including Nicolas Sarkozy before he became President, by leading Scientologists, including the actor Tom Cruise. After an 11-year inquiry, following complaints from four French former Scientologists, an independent, investigating magistrate decided that the prosecution should go ahead. Two female plaintiffs allege that, between 1997 and 1999, the French movement persuaded them to pay the equivalent of €20,000 each on drugs, vitamins, counselling, saunas and equipment to improve their mental and physical health. This included an "electrometer" to measure the state of their "spiritual condition". The movement is accused of pretending to "identify and resolve alleged psychological difficulties" and "promoting the personal flowering" of its adepts with the "sole aim of seizing their resources" and "establishing psychological control over them". Although individual Scientologists, including the cult's founder, L Ron Hubbard, have previously been convicted in France, this is the first time that the movement itself has been accused in a French court of systematic criminal activity. Scientology, officially accepted as a religion in the United States, is on trial for "escroquerie en bande organisee" - or organised financial fraud. It is also accused of dispensing drugs illegally to its members. Related Content Hong Kong: The 268 steps to enlightenment Herald daily quiz: April 18 Watch NZH Local Focus: Ditching Daniel's dreads The cult's French spokeswoman, Daniele Gounord, protested yesterday that Scientology was the victim of a "heresy trial" and "mendacious accusations". Maitre Olivier Morice, lawyer for the two remaining plaintiffs, said the court would have an opportunity "once and for all" to examine the evidence that the leaders of the Church of Scientology are driven by financial gain.

Ms Sotomayor, 54, who has now to be approved by a Senate vote, would be the first Hispanic to take the position. She would replace Justice David Souter, who announced his retirement from the top US court earlier this month. Mr Obama said he had chosen Ms Sotomayor after an "exhaustive" process, and paid tribute to her as an "inspiring woman". He said she would bring a "depth of experience and a breadth of perspective" to the role.

Conservative activists have already challenged comments she made a few years ago that a judge should not dismiss their own gender or ethnicity in deciding cases, our correspondent says. "We will thoroughly examine her record to ensure she understands that the role of a jurist in our democracy is to apply the law even-handedly, despite their own feelings or personal or political preferences," he said. White House officials told the Associated Press that Ms Sotomayor would bring more judicial experience to the Supreme Court than any other justice confirmed in the past 70 years.

Iran hangs three suspects for mosque bombing, blames U.S. and Israel
TEHRAN Iran executed in public on Saturday three men convicted of involvement in a bomb attack on a mosque that killed 25 people, the official IRNA news agency reported. The bombing in a crowded Shi'ite mosque on Thursday evening wounded more than 120 people in the southeastern city of Zahedan, two weeks before a presidential election in the Islamic Republic. "Three people convicted of being involved in the recent terrorist bombing in Zahedan were hanged in public on Saturday morning," IRNA said, adding that the executions took place near the mosque where the bombing took place. A Sunni opposition group named Jundollah (God's Soldiers), which Iran says is part of the Islamist al Qaeda network and backed by the United States, said it was behind the bombing, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said on Friday. Ebrahim Hamidi, a local judiciary official, said the men were convicted after going through the normal judiciary process, adding that they were also involved in past "terrorist activities." "The bombing happened with the explosives these three convicted criminals brought to the country," Hamidi said. "They were convicted as 'mohareb' (one who wages war against God), 'corrupt on the earth' and acting against national security," he said. A blast in a mosque in the southern city of Shiraz killed 14 people in April last year but the country has otherwise been relatively peaceful. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned the bombing, saying "no one can doubt that the hands of ... some interfering powers and their spying services are bloodied by the blood of the innocent."

Air France jet with 228 on board goes missing
PARIS, June 1 An Air France passenger jet that went missing during a flight from Brazil to France with 228 on board would have run out of fuel by now, a senior French minister said on Monday. "By now it would be beyond its kerosene reserves so unfortunately we must now envisage the most tragic scenario," said Jean-Louis Borloo, the second most senior figure in the cabinet. Borloo told France Info radio that the plane had disappeared from military as well as civilian radar screens. Photo The disappearance of an Air France jet en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on Sunday evening left seasoned crash investigators with a mystery to plumb and very little data to work with. The Airbus A330-200, carrying 228 passengers and crew members, is believed to have vanished in a towering thunderstorm with no word from its pilots that they were in crisis. The plane had beamed out several signals that its electrical systems had malfunctioned and, according to one report, that it had lost cabin pressure. The signals were sent not as distress calls, however, but as automated reports to Air France’s maintenance system, and were not read for hours, until air traffic controllers realized that the plane’s crew had not radioed in on schedule. As a search for wreckage began over a vast swath of ocean between Brazil and the African coast, experts struggled to offer plausible theories as to how a well-maintained modern jetliner, built to withstand electrical and physical buffeting far greater than nature usually offers, could have gone down so silently and mysteriously. Whatever of the plane’s final minutes was recorded in its black box may never be known, because it is presumably at the bottom of the Atlantic. As is common with trans-ocean flights, it was too far out over the sea to be tracked on land-based radar from Brazil or Senegal.

Twentieth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests passes in China
No ordinary day at Tiananmen Square On the 20th anniversary of the deadly crackdown on protesters, security personnel outnumber tourists. Metal detectors under white tents dot the square, and guides advise visitors to behave. But this day is not like every other day. It is June 4, the 20th anniversary of the brutal crackdown by the army that left hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy demonstrators dead. Just like every other day, people snap pictures of themselves in front of the "Gate of Heavenly Peace" (Tiananmen, in Mandarin), where Mao proclaimed the founding of the nation in 1949. Just like every other day, they line up at the mausoleum where his body lies preserved under glass and pose next to the 10-story obelisk Monument to the People's Heroes. As the sun peeks out over the high-rises of the nearby financial district, the guards in military regalia goose-step to the flagpole for the daily ritual in front of the iconic portrait of Mao Tse-tung. The billowing red flag climbs slowly to an accompaniment of the national anthem pumped out of loudspeakers around the square. The sky is still murky with night when the hard-core convene at Tiananmen Square. Only the most patriotic Chinese and the most dedicated tourists have yanked themselves out of bed to watch the Chinese flag rising over Beijing at sunrise.

Governor of New Hampshire signs law legalizing same-sex marriages
BOSTON  The New Hampshire legislature approved revisions to a same-sex marriage bill on Wednesday, and Gov. John Lynch promptly signed the legislation, making the state the sixth to let gay couples wed. The bill had been through several permutations to satisfy Mr. Lynch and certain legislators that it would not force religious organizations that oppose same-sex marriage to participate in ceremonies celebrating it. Some groups had feared they could be sued for refusing to allow same-sex weddings on their property. Mr. Lynch, who previously supported civil unions but not marriage for same-sex couples, said in a statement that he had heard “compelling arguments that a separate system is not an equal system.” “Today,” he said, “we are standing up for the liberties of same-sex couples by making clear that they will receive the same rights, responsibilities  and respect  under New Hampshire law.” The law will take effect on Jan. 1. Then Mr. Lynch, a centrist Democrat, said he would veto the bill unless the legislature added language also exempting religious groups and their employees from having to participate in such ceremonies. Mr. Lynch also ordered that the bill protect members of religious groups from having to provide same-sex couples with religious counseling, housing designated for married people and other services relating to “the promotion of marriage.” But the House rejected that language last month by a two-vote margin, and legislative leaders appointed a committee to negotiate a compromise. The committee last week recommended changes further emphasizing the rights of religious groups not to participate. They include a preamble to the bill that states, “Each religious organization, association, or society has exclusive control over its own religious doctrine, policy, teachings and beliefs regarding who may marry within their faith.” Republicans have called the committee’s work tainted because the Senate president, Sylvia B. Larsen, a Democrat, replaced one of its Republican members when that legislator would not sign off on last week’s compromise. As more states have legalized same-sex marriage, opponents have increasingly lobbied for “conscience protections,” language that exempts religious organizations from having to participate. But many of the bill’s opponents believe the language adopted by New Hampshire and several other states does not go far enough because it protects only religious groups and their employees. New Hampshire’s bill does not exempt photographers or florists, for example, from having to provide services. But groups that advocate for gay rights, some of whom poured money into the state in recent months, said the law was yet another step toward mainstream America accepting same-sex marriage.

Palestinian protester killed by Israeli soldiers
Activists protesting against the separation barrier have clashed with soldiers in Nilin since 2007 [AFP] Witnesses said Israeli troops fired tear gas, rubber bullets and possibly live rounds at rock-throwing demonstrators in the village. Another protester, aged 15, was wounded by the Israeli forces, the medics said. Ruling ignored About 200 people, including Israeli and foreign activists as well as Palestinians, took part in the demonstration. Activists protesting against Israel's construction of the West Bank barrier have clashed with soldiers nearly every Friday outside Nilin and nearby Bilin for more than two years. Israel says the projected 723km of steel and concrete walls, fences and barbed wire is needed for security. The Palestinians view it as a land grab that undermines their right to a state. To date Israel has built 57 per cent of the projected barrier, most of it inside the occupied West Bank. RAMALLAH, West Bank, June 5 Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian man on Friday in a confrontation with stone-throwing protesters in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian hospital officials said. Medics said Aqel Srour, 35, was hit in the chest by a live bullet and another protester was wounded when soldiers fired at protesters in Nilin, a village near the city of Ramallah. Srour died minutes later, Mohammed Shahwan, a doctor on the ambulance called to the scene, told Reuters. Nilin is the scene of weekly protests against the continuing construction of an Israeli barrier that has cut through the village. Israel says the barrier it has built along its boundary with the West Bank, territory it captured in a 1967 war, is needed to keep bombers from infiltrating its towns.

Swine flu tally nears 900 Updated Health Minister Nicola Roxon has confirmed there are now 878 confirmed cases of swine flu in Australia, as Singapore advises its residents not to travel to the worst-hit state, Victoria. Victoria has the most confirmed cases at 752. Ms Roxon says swine flu will continue to be a problem through this winter and the next despite what she calls marathon efforts to deal with it. "And I would have thought we're not at the halfway point, given that we still don't have an extensive spread in Australia," she said. "We are only part way, but closer, to having a vaccine and we are still prepared to put all our efforts into containing the disease as much as possible." Ms Roxon says doctors and hospitals around the country will begin randomly sampling flu patients to monitor the spread of human swine flu. "It gives us the tools to monitor how much of the flu in the coming weeks is seasonal flu, how much is actually this H1N1 strain, and we will simply have to keep monitoring that over the coming months," she said. "This is a time to be cautious, where the combination of the flus might turn it into something much less virulent or something more virulent." Several states have told children who have been to Victoria to stay at home for a week. Several other schools around the country have been closed to fight the spread of the virus.

Bombing of Peshawar Pearl Continental Hotel in Pakistan kills 18
ISLAMABAD: As the UN mourned the death of two of its staffers, including the Unicef's Pakistan head, in the Peshawar hotel blast, the military tightened the net around the Taliban with fresh attacks that killed 70 militants.Investigators searched the hotel for evidence on Wednesday, as the toll from the bombing mounted to 18. Dozens of foreign aid workers were at the hotel when the bombers struck. It was the seventh bombing in Peshawar in a month. CCTV footage broadcast on television channels showed a car driving through a security post, followed by an explosive-led truck. Three attackers shot their way into the hotel and detonated about 500kg of explosives.The scene at the hotel mirrored a bombing last year at Islamabad's Marriott Hotel that killed over 50. Sadruddin Hashwani, who owns both hotels, vowed to rebuild the hotel and said the government was to blamed for the attack, for it did not provide enough security to the hotel. The UN identified its slain staffers as Serbian national Aleksandar Vorkapic and and Perseveranda So of Philippines.

Gunman kills one at Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.
At 12:40 p.m. yesterday a man stepped through the doors of the U.S. He took two paces, lowered his rifle at a security guard and, before anyone could react, opened fire in a popular national landmark. The guard, who did not have time to draw his gun, fell bleeding and fatally wounded to the polished floor. Other guards fired back, cutting down the assailant. And what moments before had been a bright weekday in June became a tableau of violence. As described by bystanders and authorities, the attack inside the famed Holocaust museum turned the crowded building and Washington's nearby tourist-thronged Mall into a scene of fear and chaos, with black-clad SWAT teams, hovering helicopters and racing emergency vehicles. Stunned witnesses described a fusillade of gunfire -- five shots or more -- the blood-streaked floor and the screams of frightened visitors inside the museum and on the street. "It's like a scene from a movie," said Edward Bhopa, 54. The suspect, identified by law enforcement sources as James W. von Brunn, 88, of Annapolis, was said to be a longtime, "hard-core" supremacist whose Internet writings contain extensive, poisonous ravings against Jews and African Americans. The slain guard, Stephen T. Johns, 39, of Temple Hills, worked for the Wackenhut security company and had been employed at the museum for six years, the museum said. Officials at George Washington University Hospital, where von Brunn, Johns and an unidentified victim with less serious injuries were taken, said Johns suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and died there. Von Brunn was shot in the face, and the bullet exited his neck, according to a high-ranking police source.

Swine flu claims first UK victim
Ms Fleming had health problems before contracting the flu virus The family of the first person in Europe to die after being diagnosed with swine flu has suffered a double tragedy with the death of her baby. Jacqueline Fleming, 38, from Glasgow, died on Sunday at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. Her son Jack, who was born 11 weeks early, died on Monday in a special care baby unit at the same hospital. The baby was not infected with the Influenza A (H1N1) virus. Ms Fleming had been suffering from underlying health problems since the birth of her son. In a statement, her partner William McCann said it was an extremely distressing and difficult time for the family. He said: "My beautiful son was born on the first of June 2009, 11 weeks early. "He suffered from a number of complications and despite his brave fight he passed away earlier this evening at the Special Care Baby Unit at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley."

Militants kill at least 21 Algerian police in ambush
The ambush was not immediately confirmed by the Algerian authorities but a vast security operation has been launched in the region. Rise in violence The government of Algeria, a major oil and gas producer, has struggled for nearly two decades to combat fighters who now operate under al-Qaeda's banner. In recent weeks there has been a rise in violence across the country. In late May fighters killed five paramilitary gendarmes and a week later shot dead nine soldiers. In early June, Edwin Dyer, a British man, was killed by suspected al-Qaeda fighters who had been holding him hostage in neighbouring Mali. About 150,000 people have died in the ensuing violence. ALGIERS, Algeria, June 18 (UPI) -- The killing of some 20 Algerian paramilitary policemen in a desert ambush Wednesday by Islamist extremists linked to al-Qaida was a show of force by the jihadists who appear determined to expand their operations across the region and open a new terror front. It was formerly known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, one of the most vicious Islamist groups to emerge from Algeria's civil war throughout the 1990s. The group has a hard core of an estimated 500 to 800 fighters, a fraction of the tens of thousands active during the war between Islamists and the military-backed regime in Algiers, in which an estimated 200,000 people perished. But its alliance with Osama bin Laden has meant it has acquired seasoned fighters from other al-Qaida affiliates, many of them veterans of the insurgencies in Iraq, Afghanistan and more recently Pakistan. Arab and Western intelligence sources are convinced that al-Qaida in the Maghreb is seeking an operational alliance with other jihadist groups in Morocco, Tunisia and Libya.

Tensions rise between North Korea and United States
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. military is tracking a North Korean ship believed to be carrying illicit weapons or technology, a senior U.S. official said Thursday. The Kang Nam is known for having carried "proliferation materials," a senior U.S. official says. The ship, the Kang Nam, is a North Korean-flagged ship, according to two senior U.S. officials, and is currently in the Pacific. While the United States does not know what specifically is on the ship, the Kang Nam is a "repeat offender," known for having carried "proliferation materials," one senior defense official said. Without speaking to any details of the Kang Nam report, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the United States would not forcibly board a North Korean ship but, in accordance with the recent United Nations resolution, would request permission to search the ship or press any port the ship docks in to inspect it for illegal materials. Mullen told reporters at a news conference that neither the United States nor any other navy would board a ship without permission. "The United Nations Security Council resolution does not include an option for opposed-boarding or noncompliant boarding with respect to that," he said. "To further isolate itself, to further noncomply with international guidance and regulations in the long run puts them in a more difficult position," Mullen said. The US is "in a good position" to protect its territory from a potential North Korean missile strike, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has said.

Mr Miliband said forensic tests were being carried out on the remains to see if they were of two of the five Britons who were captured in Iraq in May 2007. The mother of one, who cannot be named for security reasons, said she was "anxious" but "hoping for the best". There had been speculation earlier this year a deal to free the men was close.

Security experts understood there had been positive diplomatic moves behind the scenes to free them, including the release of a prisoner whose freedom was being demanded by the hostage-takers. "We have never speculated on the outcome of this case although we have been working intensively on it, so the overriding feeling today is one of deep sadness and fear." He said forensic examinations are under way to establish the identities of the bodies and how they died. "As would be the case with any development of this kind, they will fear the worst for their loved ones. "This is terrible moment of uncertainty and fear for them."

Alzheimer's disease reversed in mice using caffeine
MIAMI, July 6 (UPI) -- Memory impairment was reversed in aged mice, bred to develop symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, after they were given caffeine, U.S. researchers said. Researchers at the University of South Florida said back-to-back studies show caffeine significantly decreased abnormal levels of the protein linked to Alzheimer's disease -- both in the brains and in the blood of mice exhibiting symptoms of the disease. Both studies build upon previous research by the University of South Florida that showed caffeine in early adulthood prevented the onset of memory problems in mice bred to develop Alzheimer's symptoms in old age. "The new findings provide evidence that caffeine could be a viable 'treatment' for established Alzheimer's disease, and not simply a protective strategy," lead author Gary Arendash said in a statement. "That's important because caffeine is a safe drug for most people, it easily enters the brain, and it appears to directly affect the disease process." In the study, half of the 55 mice genetically altered to develop memory problems mimicking Alzheimer's disease were given caffeine, and half were given water. Dr Gary Arendash, an American neuroscientist, claims to have uncovered evidence that caffeine not only helps to stave off the disease but can treat it. A key aspect of Alzheimer's is sticky clumps of an abnormal protein in the brain called beta amyloid plaques. Mice with a rodent equivalent of the disease showed a 50 per cent reduction in levels of amyloid protein in their brains after the scientists added caffeine to their drinking water. At the end of the two-month study, the caffeine-drinking mice performed far better on tests of memory and thinking than mice given only water.

Iran warns West about meddling while clerics opine
Some members of Iran's powerful clerical class are stepping up their antigovernment protests over Iran's election in defiance of the country's supreme leader, bringing potential aid to opposition figures as the regime is increasingly labeling them foreign-sponsored traitors. An influential group of religious scholars seen as politically neutral during the presidential election called the country's highest election arbiter, the Guardian Council, biased, and said the June 12 election was "invalid." The powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps, a parallel force to the military with its own army, navy, air force and intelligence service, continued a repressive line. “Today, no one is impartial,” said Gen. Yadollah Javani, the political director of the Revolutionary Guards, in comments made Sunday as reported by IRNA, the official news agency. “There are two currents: those who defend and support the revolution and the establishment, and those who are trying to topple it.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story General Javani said the elite corps had taken measures before the election to resist the “counterrevolution,” according to the state-run Press TV. “We came up against a deep mischief during this election,” he said. “A mischief that gave birth to the new divisions. During these events, the eye of the mischief was damaged, but it was not blinded. Now the eye of the mischief must be blinded completely and gouged out, and this can be done by illuminating the events behind the scenes.” However, the Revolutionary Guards’ commander, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, said that the guards’ actions should not be seen as “meddling” in politics. After the Guardian Council validated his re-election on June 29 — despite continuing accusations of fraud — many political analysts and protesters complained that the whole election process amounted to a military coup.

UN disappointment The deal, however, was described by Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, as "not sufficient". Ban said in a statement that the deal should be backed by medium-term measures to prevent the catastrophic impact of climate change. "The commitments expressed today at the G8 and Major Economies Forum (MEF) leaders' meeting, while welcome, are not sufficient," Ban said in a statement.

"If they fail to act this year, they will have squandered a unique historical opportunity that may not come again."

by Michael Stoddard BBC South The workers have only been getting a few hours sleep a night The 25 or so workers continuing a sit-in protest at the Vestas wind turbine site on the Isle of Wight say morale is high, but what is it really like on the inside? The all-male group have been sleeping on the floor, washing in a sink basin and running low on food. One of the workers, who did not want to be named, said: "There are a few stinky bodies and it is hard being away from your family and kids but we've managed to stay in touch on our mobiles which has been great. "One guy has even called us up after seeing the publicity and asked for our mobile numbers and topped our phones up with £10, it's great to see such support." They are protesting at Danish company Vestas Windsystems plan to make 625 workers redundant at the end of this month, despite rising profits. The men have been telling each other jokes in a bid to keep spirits up. 'Face sack' "One of the guys found a pair of latex cycling shorts in the office, so we all had a good laugh when he put them on and ran around. He jokingly added: "It's all guys here so good to be away from the women for a while." The workers say morale is still high inside the factory The protester said the experience is probably similar to being on the television show Big Brother. "We are pretty cut off from the outside world and food has been running low, there's no television and we've been mostly listening to the radio.

Vestas protesters sacked with immediate effect
When the Big Green Gathering, a festival for environmentally minded individuals to share ideas about tackling climate change while practising a little reiki, was cancelled at the weekend, those with tickets were left with nowhere to go. Now a new festival seems to have sprung up to fill the breach. The internet is alive with messages about "Vestival", with activists urging people due to attend the four-day gathering to head instead to the Isle of Wight to support workers protesting against facing the closure of the Vestas wind turbine factory. The BGG was cancelled on Sunday after Mendip district council and Somerset police sought a high court injunction to stop it going ahead. Marina Pepper, an eco-campaigner and Liberal Democrat councillor, tweeted her encouragement to would-be demonstrators today, saying: "Vestival is go. If you can get to Newport by 9.30am Wednesday, all the better (Vestas workers up in court to be evicted). The tone of some tweets verged on celebratory, with climatecamp tweeting: "Then get ye down to Vestival this weekend. The #BGG is going back to its roots. A Facebook group, Save Vestas Isle of Wight From Closure, has gathered more than 450 members. It directs people towards the Save Vestas blog, which records the news that a judge in Newport refused to grant Vestas a possession order for the occupied factory, and adjourned the case to 4 August. Danish owners of wind turbine company unable to force workers out of Isle of Wight factory Workers occupying a wind turbine factory on the Isle of Wight vowed to continue their protest for another week today after a legal attempt to evict them quickly failed.

Colombia's relations with Venezuela deteriorate over Swedish rockets
STOCKHOLM, July 28 The Swedish government said on Tuesday it had asked Venezuela for information on how Swedish-made weapons exported to the South American country had found their way to rebels in neighbouring Colombia. Colombia authorities said on Monday they had seized anti-tank weapons purchased in Europe by Venezuela in the hands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. [ID:nN27540288]  "It is correct that they have found these weapons to be Swedish-made," said Jens Eriksson, a top political adviser at the Foreign Ministry to Trade Minister Ewa Bjorling. "We are working together with Colombian authorities to investigate the matter further and we have contacted Venezuelan authorities to clear up how these arms ended up in Colombia." Venezuelan Interior Minister Tareck El Aissami denied on Monday the weapons found in the hands of FARC, which has been fighting for a socialist revolution since the 1960s and is labelled a terrorist organisation by the United States, had come from Venezuela. Eriksson said "a smaller quantity" of arms, mainly ammunition, had also been found in rebel hands. A Swedish Foreign Ministry official said the anti-tank weapons had been exported to Venezuela in the 1980s but that some shipments of ammunition for the weapons systems had occurred at a later date. No licenses have been issued for arms exports to Colombia while no shipments of weapons to Venezuela under a 2006 licence has been carried out in recent years, Eriksson said. In an interview with Caracol Radio Monday, Santos addressed local reports of anti-tank weapons manufactured in Sweden being seized from members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and traced to Venezuela. "In several operations in which we have recovered weapons from the FARC, we have found powerful munitions and powerful equipment, including anti-tank weapons, from a European country that sold them to Venezuela and that turned up in the hands of the FARC."

Haitian migrants drown and many more still missing
MIAMI At least 15 Haitian migrants drowned and more than 65 were missing after their wooden sail boat hit a reef and sank off the Turks and Caicos islands, local police and the U.S. Coast Guard said on Tuesday. More than 120 people were rescued following the shipwreck late on Sunday, and Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were assisting Turks and Caicos authorities in the search for more survivors. Police in the British territory said 15 bodies had been recovered in waters off West Caicos, a sparsely inhabited island popular with divers and boaters. "Our search is continuing, by sea and air," Petty Officer Nick Ameen said in Miami. "As time progresses, the possibility for survival diminishes," he added. Turks and Caicos police spokesman Sergeant Calvin Chase said there were conflicting reports about how many people had been on board the wooden sloop, which he said was carrying illegal migrants from Haiti trying to reach the United States. Estimates given earlier by the Coast Guard ranged from 160 to 200. "The boat ran aground on a reef, Molasses Reef, off West Caicos," Chase told Reuters by phone. "We have a total of 15 dead bodies now," he added. Earlier, he said 122 migrants -- 22 women and the rest men -- had been rescued. "They are illegal immigrants," Chase said, adding the repatriation of the survivors back to Haiti had already begun.

Michael Schumacher returns to Formula One to replace injured Massa
Formula One was rocked by two developments Wednesday when seven-time champion Michael Schumacher said he would come out of retirement to drive again for Ferrari, and BMW announced it would leave the international racing series at season's end. Ferrari and Schumacher, 40, confirmed speculation that he would temporarily replace driver Felipe Massa, who was seriously injured during qualifying for last weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix. Schumacher retired after the 2006 season, having won five of his titles with Ferrari, which he continued to serve as a consultant and occasional test driver. "For loyalty reasons to the team, I cannot ignore that unfortunate situation" with Massa, he said. "I also very much look forward to facing this challenge," the German driver said. Formula One's next event, the European Grand Prix in Valencia, Spain, is Aug. 23. The race was added to the schedule only last year -- a race won by Massa -- and Schumacher has yet to race on that track. "Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro intends to entrust Michael Schumacher with Felipe Massa's car until the Brazilian driver is able to race again," Ferrari announced on its website. "Michael Schumacher has shown his willingness and in the next few days he will undergo a specific programme of preparation at the end of which it will be possible to confirm his participation in the championship starting with the European Grand Prix." Schumacher, who most certainly does not need the money, said as recently as three weeks ago that he had no intention of making a comeback in a sport he bestrode like a colossus for 15 seasons. And as Weber pointed out, the most successful F1 driver of all time, a man with 91 grand prix wins to his name, is not one to settle for second best.

England remembers Bobby Robson
Donations have been pouring in to a fund set up by Sir Bobby Robson to fight cancer. Over the weekend, fans at matches paid tribute to the County Durham-born footballing legend, who died on Friday after a long battle with the disease. The tributes included a shrine at Newcastle's St James' Park, which Sir Bobby's family visited on Sunday. A page on the Just Giving website has been flooded with donations and had reached £1.6m on Monday morning. The Sir Bobby Robson Foundation was set up by the former England manager in March 2008 to raise money to fund clinical trials of new drugs and treatments to beat cancer. Books of condolence Professor Ruth Plummer, from the foundation, said: "There have been pages of donations even from early Friday morning looking at the website. "People have been incredibly generous yet again, this time in memory of Sir Bobby." Thousands of tributes have been left at St James' Park On Monday, books of condolence were opened at customer service centres around Newcastle. People can also sign a book at the Town Hall, in Durham, while another at Fulham's Craven Cottage ground has been open over the weekend. Newcastle United said tens of thousands of people had visited St James' Park since Friday, leaving flowers, scarves, banners and shirts. The Sir John Hall Stand at the ground will be open from 0900 to 1700 BST each day this week for people to continue to pay their tributes. Minute's applause There were also tributes at Ipswich's Portman Road ground, where he had a successful 13-year spell as manager. Sir Bobby was remembered before pre-season matches over the weekend, including a minute's applause at Newcastle's match at Dundee United and Ipswich's game with Real Valladolid on Friday night.

Nigerian victory marred by deaths in custody
The BBC has obtained a photograph which shows that Yusuf Mohamed, the leader of the Boko Haram sect in Nigeria, was alive when captured by the army. They handed him over to the police. A few hours later, journalists were shown his bullet-ridden body. The police said he had been fatally wounded while trying to evade capture. Mr Yusuf's Islamic sect is blamed for days of violent clashes with security forces across northern Nigeria, which killed hundreds of people. Nigeria's declaration of victory over Taliban-style militants was overshadowed last night by demands for an inquiry into the "extrajudicial killing" of the sect's leader. The bullet-riddled body of Mohammed Yusuf, head of the Islamist sect Boko Haram, was shown to journalists hours after police announced his capture at the end of a four-day manhunt. Emmanuel Ojukwu, a national police spokesman, said: "This group operates under a charismatic leader. The leader who they thought was invincible and immortal has now been proved otherwise." But the triumphalism was punctured by conflicting accounts of how Yusuf died. Colonel Ben Ahanotu, commander of the military operation against Boko Haram, who claims he personally captured Yusuf, said that he had been unarmed and gave himself up willingly.

Food packages to Vestas occupiers cut off
Mass walkouts could be commonplace in a new "age of militancy" as pay deals are curbed, according to Policy Exchange. The stark message came as fears grew of a summer of discontent with a series of strikes already planned or likely, including a possible national postal strike. Holidaymakers and railway passengers could all be hit while the row over foreign workers is set to deepen with plans to ballot workers at power stations and oil refineries following the recent unofficial action. One union warned British workers have become increasingly militant and angry with pay the cost of a recession "they did not create". Neil O'Brien, director of Policy Exchange, said: "There is a slight increase in militancy at the moment but that is nothing compared to what is going to happen once the brakes are slammed on public spending. "When we suddenly go from a very very rapid increase in pay to huge pressure on public spending, it is possible that we could have something develop like the 1970s." During the 1970s the number of strikes averaged between 2,000 and 3,000 every year, peaking in 1979 when almost 30 million working days were lost due to industrial action. "I think what is happening is people are being expected to pay a heavy price for a recession that they did not create," he said. "Increasingly people are realising there are expected to carry the can for what is none of their doing. A summer of discontent is an overused phrase but the RMT is not surprised people are angry enough and saying 'we have had enough of this and better do something about this'." As the recession deepens there is growing unrest among workers and the country is already bracing itself for a number of walkouts over the coming weeks.

Police evict Vestas protesters
by Michael Stoddard BBC South The workers ended the protest in dramatic fashion There were cheers, tears and defiance as the final six Vestas workers ended their 19-day sit-in protest. Bailiffs had to force their way inside the first-floor office, which has been the protesters' home since 20 July. One worker leapt from a balcony, landing in a bush. Two others abseiled from the factory while hundreds of supporters aimed chants of "shame" at the factory owners. "It is all a bit bewildering but it's a wonderful feeling to get out and a major relief," one of the workers told BBC News. "We all feel like we have scored a moral victory and believe it has been more than worthwhile. "I can't wait to have a cold beer, long wash and a chicken vindaloo curry." VESTAS SIT-IN ENDS By the BBC's Steve Humphrey on the Isle of Wight After 19 days of a tense stand off, it all ended in less than an hour in a frantic and dramatic fashion. They all looked remarkably well but in need of a good meal and shower, but still vowing to fight on. The group had barricaded themselves inside the wind turbine blade factory in Newport on the Isle of Wight in protest at Vestas' plans to close the site and other operations with the loss of 625 jobs. They defied requests to leave from management, a court order and only left when bailiffs arrived to evict them. It is thought up to 12 workers had occupied the factory during the protest with little food and limited washing and sleeping facilities.

600 people missing after typhoon hits Taiwan
TAIPEI, Taiwan -- TV stations say Taiwan's military has rescued about 130 people whose village has been consumed by a typhoon-spawned mudslide, but there is no word on the fate of hundreds of others buried by the disaster in the island's south. The mudslide touched off by Typhoon Morakot inundated the remote mountain village of Shiao Lin on Sunday, leaving at least 400 people unaccounted for. The storm dumped as much as 80 inches (2 meters) of rain on the island before moving on to China. On Tuesday, authorities said at least 41 people were confirmed dead and 60 were missing after Morakot swept Taiwan. Those tolls do not include the residents of Shiao Lin, whose fate has been unclear since Sunday's mudslide. BEIJING, Aug. 10 (UPI) -- Mudslides struck China and Taiwan, raising the toll of dead and missing, as the two countries battled rains and floods from Typhoon Morakot, officials said. In Taiwan, where floods and rains have already killed at least 23 people and left 56 missing since the typhoon struck Friday, a massive land and mudslide Monday smashed into the village of Xiaolin in Taiwan's Kaohsiung County. Rescuers said at least 180 residents in the village of about 600 survived the mudslides and 76 had been moved to safety Monday afternoon, Taipei Times reported. But that still left the fate of the others unknown. Taiwanese military and other rescuers were trying to reach or find hundreds of people stranded or reported missing in the mountainous areas of southern Taiwan, where fallen bridges and raging rivers were hampering their efforts, Taipei Times reported. In China, a massive landslide Monday night brought down up to seven apartment buildings in eastern Pengxi Township in Taishun County in Zhejiang Province, burying an unknown number of residents, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, quoting local authorities. The report said rescuers had pulled six people alive from the debris by Tuesday with one of them reported in critical condition. The landslide was triggered by continuous torrential rain from Typhoon Morakot, which has already killed six people and left three others missing since making landfall in China's eastern coastal region Sunday.

Cargo ship Arctic Sea may be found
Advertisement Mystery still surrounds a missing Russian-manned cargo ship, with a sighting off Africa's Cape Verde islands still to be confirmed. The Arctic Sea, with 15 Russian crew members on board, was last sighted in the Bay of Biscay on 30 July. Cape Verde officials say they think the ship is 400 nautical miles (740km) off one of the islands. But Moscow's envoy to Cape Verde said he had not been informed of any confirmed sighting. The 4,000-tonne Maltese-flagged vessel, which had been carrying timber, went off radar after passing through the English Channel. Click here for a map charting sightings of the Arctic Sea There has been huge speculation over the reason for its disappearance, ranging from pirates to a mafia dispute to a commercial quarrel. AFP news agency quoted Finnish police as saying a ransom demand had been made of the ship's Finnish owners, Solchart Management. A source linked to the Cape Verde coastguard told AFP the Arctic Sea was outside its territorial waters. The coastguard was informing maritime officials about the ship's movements, the source said, adding: "When the ship enters our jurisdiction, we will decide in consultation with our partners what actions to take." Some reports have put the ship 400 nautical miles north of the Cape Verdean island of Sao Vicente. French intelligence said it had found a ship matching the Arctic Sea's description in the area. Radar contact with the Arctic Sea was lost after it left the English Channel However, the Russian ambassador to Cape Verde, Alexander Karpushin, said he had not been officially informed of the sighting and told Russia's RAI agency the sighting was "not true".

Vestas plant in Newport, England shuts down
Vestas, the wind-turbine maker, closed two factories on the South Coast yesterday with the loss of 425 jobs. The Danish company ceased blade production at its sites in Southampton and on the Isle of Wight. Workers had occupied the Isle of Wight plant for 18 days in protest at the closures until last week. Vestas Wind Systems had obtained a court order after six workers barricaded themselves into the plant for more than two weeks in a bid to delay its closure. Members of the Climate Rush campaign group, left, also chained themselves to Business Secretary Lord Mandelson's home in London, in an "act of solidarity". Originally it was believed there would be 625 job cuts but Vestas said yesterday that it had made 425 staff redundant. The firm said it had mitigated job losses, with 40 employees found new roles and 57 continuing work at the factory for a further period to assist in its closure. Turbine maker says closures will balance demand, as boss criticises UK's commitment to wind and hints at redundancy reinstatement for protesters Vestas has confirmed the closure of two sites on the Isle of Wight and Southampton with the loss of 425 jobs. The protest was hugely embarrassing for the government at a time when it is promoting wind energy and green jobs. The Vestas plant was the only one in the country making components for wind turbines. The company said that 40 employees had been found new roles within the Vestas research and development facility on the Isle of Wight.

Lockerbie bombing appeal dropped
(CNN) -- A Scottish court has formally allowed Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi to abandon his second appeal against his conviction over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, in which 270 people were killed when an airliner was blown out of the sky. Convicted bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, pictured in 1992, has terminal cancer. Last week, al Megrahi lodged a "minute of abandonment" with the Scottish Court Service, which is a legal move to drop an appeal. The Scottish Court of Appeal in Edinburgh confirmed Tuesday it had accepted the request. Analysts say the move may be part of a deal al Megrahi is seeking with Scottish authorities to be released on compassionate grounds. A compassionate release could allow al Megrahi, who has maintained his innocence, to return to his native Libya. Megrahi, 57, who is suffering from terminal prostate cancer, is currently serving a life sentence for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 which killed 189 U.S. citizens and 270 people in total. The court announcement follows increasing pressure from the U.S. for Al Megrahi to remain imprisoned in Scotland. The letter, which includes the signatures of John Kerry, the current chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and veteran Edward Kennedy, has expressed concern about reports that Al Megrahi is about to be released. The letter states: "We believe he (Al Megrahi) should remain in Scotland to complete his sentence in prison." In their letter the senators also remind Scotland's Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill -- who is considering an application to release the Libyan national on compassionate grounds -- that "until the tragic events of September 11, 2001, no terrorist act had killed more American civilians." The letter continues: "Our international agreement called for his sentence to be served in Scotland and we believe strongly there should be no deviation from this sentence."

Usain Bolt breaks 200m and 100m sprint records at championships
Welcome to the life of Usain Bolt, aka Lightning Bolt, the fastest man who ever lived, and not your conventional athletics hero. Certainly his exploits on a running track epitomise the Olympic motto: Citius, Altius, Fortius. At last year's Olympic Games in Beijing, the Jamaican, who turned 23 yesterday, became a global star by winning the 100m (at a canter), the 200m (with apparent ease), and a third gold medal in the 4 x 100m relay, all in world record times. Nobody had performed that treble feat before and, in doing it, Bolt not only became Jamaica's most famous global export since Bob Marley, but also the flag-bearer for a revival of athletics as a credible, crowd-pulling sport. This week he has raised his game again, from the merely staggering to the frankly awesome, to confirm himself as the supreme sprinter of this or any other age. At the world championships in Berlin, he won the world 100m gold medal last Sunday in 9.58 seconds, knocking 0.11sec – a whopping margin – from the 9.69sec record he set in China. Then on Thursday evening he followed that by winning the 200m gold in 19.19sec, again knocking 0.11sec from the 19.30sec record he set in China. "I can definitely say I didn't expect that," he said immediately afterwards. "I was tired but thought, 'What the heck, let's try'." Experts are at a loss to predict how fast Bolt might run when he peaks – and he could continue getting faster for years. Some say 9.4 seconds or lower for 100m is inevitable, while 19 seconds for the 200m may not be beyond him. To put this in context, the 200m world record before the Beijing Games was held by Michael Johnson, an American widely regarded as an all-time great, with four Olympic gold medals and eight world championship gold medals in his career.

Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi released on compassionate grounds
Abdel Basset al-Megrahi was convicted in 2001 for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103[AP] Abdel Basset al-Megrahi was convicted in 2001 for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103[AP] Barack Obama, the US president, described the release as a "mistake" and said that al-Megrahi should be placed under house arrest on his return. Al-Megrahi 'relieved' Al-Megrahi returned to Libya after boarding a plane at Prestwick airport in Glasgow, Scotland. He was earlier released from Greenock prison and escorted by a police convoy to the airport. In a statement following his release, al-Megrahi said: "I am obviously very relieved to be leaving my prison cell at last and returning to Libya, my homeland. "The remaining days of my life are being lived under the shadow of the wrongness of my conviction. "I have been faced with an appalling choice: to risk dying in prison in the hope that my name is cleared posthumously or to return home still carrying the weight of the guilty verdict, which will never now be lifted. "The choice which I made is a matter of sorrow, disappointment and anger, which I fear I will never overcome." 'Going to die' Amr El-Kahky, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Tripoli, the Liban capital, said Libyans were "triumphant" at his return. "Al-Megrahi's mother said she has her home door open, because she won't believe that he is free unless she sees him for herself," he said local press had reported. MacAskill ruled out allowing al-Megrahi to live in Scotland due to security concerns.

Presidential election held in Afghanistan
Advertisement Afghan President Hamid Karzai and his Western allies have pronounced the country's election a success, after voting passed off largely peacefully. Mr Karzai hailed Afghans for braving Taliban "bombs and intimidations". There were some attacks by insurgents, but the UN says the vast majority of polling stations were able to function. President Karzai is facing challenges from about 30 rivals. Official results are not expected for two weeks. "The Afghan people dared rockets, bombs and intimidations," he told reporters as polls closed following a one-hour extension. Mr Karzai praised the citizens who turned out to vote "We'll see what the turnout was. In Washington, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said: "Lots of people have defied threats of violence and terror to express their thoughts about the next government for the people of Afghanistan." Mr Karzai said that based on reports by the interior ministry, 73 attacks had taken place in 15 provinces. Among the violent incidents reported: Taliban militants stormed a town in Baghlan, northern Afghanistan, preventing polling stations from opening, police tell AFP news agency.

Find full listings here By Chris Whyatt Renault's Fernando Alonso set the fastest lap in Friday practice for the European Grand Prix while stuttering championship leaders Brawn went well. Despite a collision with Nick Heidfeld, the Spaniard clocked one minute 39:404 seconds in the quicker second session. "I had a bit of a half spin in the high speed corner and damaged the wing," said the 24-year-old. "I didn't even really feel it but I did touch the wall and grazed the front but it could have been a lot worse. I think we'll still be good tomorrow [for qualifying] so I'm still positive. It's just a shame we missed so much time but it can be regained Lewis Hamilton "We made some changes this weekend and tried something new on my car and we don't have lots of wings available but if we go back to the old set-up then we have spares so it won't be a problem. It's just a shame we missed so much time but it can be regained." Practice timesheets are essentially irrelevant - teams are largely testing cars and running different programmes for each of their two drivers in order to collect data they can analyse afterwards. But McLaren, for whom world champion Hamilton won the last grand prix in Hungary, may be heartened that their recent progress appears to be continuing with their strong showing in the first session, as Heikki Kovalainen and Hamilton came second and third respectively. Friday practice at the Valencia street circuit marked the first grand prix action after a month-long summer break and many teams have brought modified cars into the 11th instalment of the 17-race season.

UK denies pressuring Scotland into Lockerbie release
LONDON, England (CNN) -- Libya warned the United Kingdom that if the Lockerbie bomber died in prison in Scotland, it would have "catastrophic effects for the relationship between Libya and the U.K.," documents declassified Tuesday show. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, second from left, arrives in Tripoli, Libya, on August 21. The statement was made by Abdulati Alobidi, the Libyan minister for Europe, to a British Foreign Office minister in February and was repeated to Scottish officials the following month, newly declassified Scottish government notes from the meetings say. Alobidi had earlier told Scottish officials it would be "a major problem should Mr. al Megrahi die in prison, and would be viewed as a form of death sentence." The Scottish and British governments released more than 100 pages of previously secret government letters Tuesday. Watch more about the documents » They are trying to squelch newspaper claims that the British government wanted al Megrahi to be eligible for release as a part of a deal allowing BP to drill for oil in Libya. But they seem unlikely to put an end to the controversy over the release of the man convicted of killing 270 people in the bombing nearly 21 years ago. Al Megrahi was released from prison last month because he has terminal cancer, and received a hero's welcome in Libya. U.S. President Barack Obama reacted strongly to al Megrahi's welcome, calling it "highly objectionable." "We have made clear (to Libya) on diplomatic channels that, for any reason, any Prisoner Transfer Agreement with Libya could not cover Mr. al Megrahi," Falconer said, adding that under the terms of relations between London and Edinburgh, any steps regarding al Megrahi's future "will ultimately be for Scottish ministers to take."

Two jockeys killed in fire in North Yorkshire, England
The two jockeys died as the fire spread through the flats in Buckrose Court in Norton, near Malton, in the early hours of Saturday. Neighbours said they believed Miss Wilson was the girlfriend of another jockey, Ian Brennan, who jumped out of a window at the three-storey block to escape. Alan Foster, a businessman in his 30s who owns the building, said he let the flat to Mr Kyne and Mr Brennan, who had recently moved to Malton from Dublin. Mr Foster said he thought the fire had started in a hallway. Currently third in the apprentice jockey championship, he rode for the Irish trainer John Quinn, who runs a racing yard in Malton. Miss Wilson, from Forfar, Scotland, was riding in her first season of professional racing for the trainer David Barron and had been due to ride her mother’s horse, Imperial Sword, at Thirsk on Saturday. “She was just at the start of her career and was only in her first year of riding as an apprentice,” he said. “She joined me at the end of last year and had ridden three winners for me out of only a handful of rides. Everyone in the yard is just devastated.” Her parents, Margaret and Drew Wilson, were too upset to speak as they travelled from Forfar to North Yorkshire. Mr Kyne was also due to have ridden on Saturday at Haydock, where jockeys wore black armbands and a 20-second silence was observed before the first race. Thirsk and Kempton racecourses also staged moments of silence, and flags at York racecourse flew at half mast, while jockeys at Stratford donned black armbands.

Large bomb defused in Northern Ireland
British army bomb disposal experts have defused a large explosive device found planted close to the border in south Armagh today. The 600lb device was found on a roadside near the village of Forkhill and had a command wire leading to a firing point on the other side of the border. Dissident republicans are believed to be responsible for planting the bomb. Irish soldiers and Gardai mounted a security operation on the southern side of the border while the device was being made safe today. The remnants have now been taken away for forensic examination. A major security operation was launched following the bomb find Police have said a large bomb left close to the Irish border in south Armagh was intended to kill officers. The 600lb bomb was made safe by an Army bomb disposal team near Forkhill. The device had a command wire running from where it was planted in Northern Ireland to a firing point across the border in the Republic. Police said it could have had a "devastating outcome". "The actions of terrorist criminals in planting this device in the Forkhill area put local people and police officers at significant risk," Chief Inspector Sam Cordner said.

Deadly flash flooding hits northwestern Turkey
Advertisement At least 23 people have been killed and a number of others are missing after flash floods in north-west Turkey. The flooding struck districts in and around Turkey's largest city of Istanbul, swamping houses and roads. Cars were swept away and some drivers were trapped inside their vehicles. TV pictures showed roads near Istanbul's main airport submerged by deep water. The flooding was caused by two days of torrential rainfall - the worst in 80 years. 'Disaster' As waters rose, police and military helicopters rescued people from rooftops in Istanbul and its suburbs. My friend got stuck in the truck after the water rose all at once.

New York Times reporter rescued in Afghanistan
British special forces in Afghanistan rescued a New York Times reporter who was kidnapped Saturday by the Taliban, but the deaths of his interpreter and a British commando in the predawn raid Wednesday raised questions about the operation. Gunmen had seized journalist Stephen Farrell, who is a dual British-Irish citizen, and Afghan interpreter Sultan Munadi in a village in Kunduz province that was the scene of bombings last week by North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces that killed dozens of people. British commandos freed a New York Times reporter early Wednesday from Taliban captives who kidnapped him over the weekend in northern Afghanistan, but one of the commandos and a Times' translator were killed in the rescue, officials said.Reporter Stephen Farrell was taken hostage along with his translator in the northern province of Kunduz on Saturday. German commanders had ordered U.S. jets to drop bombs on two hijacked fuel tankers, causing a number of civilian casualties, and reporters traveled to the area to cover the story.One British service member died during the raid, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said, while the Times reported that Farrell's Afghan translator, Sultan Munadi, 34, also was killed. Brown said "we send his family our condolences." Farrell was unhurt.Gunfire rang out from multiple sides during the rescue, and a Taliban commander who was in the house was killed, along with the owner of the house and a woman, said Mohammad Sami Yowar, a spokesman for the Kunduz governor.Munadi was killed in the midst of the firefight, he said. A British defense official said he couldn't rule out the possibility he was killed by British gunfire.Afghan officials over the weekend said about 70 people died when U.S. jets dropped two bombs on the tankers, igniting them in a massive explosion. There were reports that villagers who had come to collect fuel from the tankers were among the dead, and Farrell wanted to interview villagers.The Times reported that while Farrell and Munadi were talking to Afghans near the site of the bombing, an old man approached them and warned them to leave. Soon after, gunshots rang out and people shouted that the Taliban were approaching.Police had warned reporters who traveled to the capital of Kunduz to cover the tanker strike that the village in question was controlled by the Taliban, and it would be dangerous to go there.The Times kept the kidnappings quiet out of concern for the men's safety, and other media outlets, including The Associated Press, did not report the abductions following a request from the Times.quoted Farrell saying he had been "extracted" by a commando raid carried out by "a lot of soldiers" in a firefight.Mohammad Sami Yowar, a spokesman for the Kunduz governor, said British Special Forces dropped down from helicopters early Wednesday onto the house where the two were being kept, and a gun battle ensued.A Taliban commander who was in the house was killed, along with the owner of the house and a woman who was inside, Yowar said. He said Sultan was killed in the midst of the firefight.Contradicting Yowar's claim, a Taliban commander from Kunduz province toldWednesday morning in a phone call that no militants were killed in the firefight. He said the battle took place at a civilian house being used by the Taliban, but that all militants fled the scene safely.The militant, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, claimed one Afghan civilian was killed and another injured in the firefight. The Taliban left the house without losing any fighters," he said, adding, "we are sorry for the death of the Afghan in the shootout. "The militant commander's claims could not be independently verified, but Taliban claims are often exaggerated.Farrell, a dual Irish-British citizen, told the Times that he saw Munadi step forward shouting "Journalist!

Yale graduate student who went missing before wedding found dead
(Facebook Photo) The 24-year-old bride-to-be, who had been missing since Tuesday, apparently met a violent death in a secure Yale University building accessible only to students and staff, police said Sunday on what was supposed to be her wedding day.Authorities have said little about the investigation.They hadn't positively identified the body found hidden in a wall Sunday, but they were assuming it was Annie Le's and treating her disappearance as a homicide.State police found the body in a building in Yale's medical complex, about a mile from the main campus. It was in an area that houses utility cables that run between floors.The university planned a candlelight vigil at 8 p.m. Monday at the Ivy League university. The Yale Daily News says an e-mail to the Yale community invites participants to "bring a candle and join us in solidarity. "Just seven months before Le went missing, the graduate student wrote a magazine article about how to stay safe on the streets around the Ivy League school. Annie Le was so focused on academics that, even though she was the valedictorian of her high school class and her classmates voted her “most likely to be the next Einstein,” she filled out 102 applications for scholarships. “My tongue is sore from licking envelopes, my wrist hurts from typing and stapling, and the post office clerk knows me on a first name basis,” she wrote in a one-page primer she left in the files of the school in El Dorado, Calif., “but other than that, there is nothing I can complain about; It was not difficult at all!” Her work paid off, literally: She received $160,000 in scholarship offers, said Tony DeVille, who became principal three years ago, three years after she graduated. She went on to Yale, where, as a 24-year-old graduate student, she was studying pharmacology and planning her wedding to another serious-minded student from her days in Rochester. But Ms. Le’s promising life ended in the basement of an ultramodern science building that has what other graduate students at Yale described as tight security.

British chef Keith Floyd dies at age 65
When it first appeared on a regional strand of the BBC in 1985, Keith Floyd's 10-minute cooking slot attracted 10,000 viewers' calls asking for recipes and greater exposure for the genial chef, mainly from female viewers. Over the next 15 years Floyd produced 19 series for the BBC and Channel 5 from every corner of the globe, and wrote more than 20 cookbooks to accompany his programmes. Long after he had effectively retired from British television screens the BBC continued to syndicate his shows to foreign audiences with whom they proved enduringly popular. Combining raffish charm and contagious enthusiasm on screen, Floyd's programmes dispensed with the static formality that had defined the television cookery of his forerunners, such as Fanny Cradock. Indeed they rarely took place in anything that could be defined as a studio. Instead he was likely to be found braced over a camping stove on the heaving deck of a North Sea trawler, rhapsodising over a sea bass. So too was his penchant for ad libbing jocular instructions to his film crew. A generation of viewers became familiar with Clive and various other long-suffering cameramen, who were forever being ordered to get in close for a look at a fish gill or the marbling on a steak. This he owed to his long-standing BBC producer David Pritchard, who advised him to fill in the boring bits with "a quick slurp". A committed drinker, Floyd slurped more than any television chef before or since. With craggy good looks, slightly askew bow tie and upper-class tones gravelled by a prodigious smoking habit, Floyd had something of the roguish charm of a 1950s chancer about him.

U.S. Senate releases version of Healthcare Bill
worked for months to find common ground with Republicans on health care reform — but when he released his long-anticipated proposal Wednesday, the real problem quickly came into focus. He set the stage for a titanic struggle within his own party. Story Continued Below Reaction from congressional Democratic leaders was lukewarm to worse, progressives were downright hostile and Republicans were scornful of what they described as brazen government grab. But Baucus may have provided lawmakers with the only viable blueprint for winning support across Congress, because he sought to find elements that pleased all sides. “There are honest and principled differences on all of us working for reform, and this package may not represent all of our first choices,” Baucus said. “But at the end of the day, we all share a common purpose: that is to make the lives of Americans better tomorrow than they are today and to get health care reform done, which means the time for action is now.” The next challenge for Baucus and the Senate leadership is to get the bill out of the Finance Committee — but after that, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will need to merge the Finance bill with one approved in July by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Even Reid, who has generally supported Baucus’s efforts, sounded less than pleased, saying he needs to be convinced the bill is right for Nevada on a proposed Medicaid expansion. Baucus has made the challenge clear for Democrats, who now must choose between competing visions of health reform: an employer mandate versus fees on employers, a public insurance option versus nonprofit insurance cooperatives, and taxes on millionaires versus industry and people with expensive health care plans. It would leave 25 million people uninsured in 2019 — a third of whom are illegal immigrants — compared with 17 million in the House bill.

Pope Benedict XVI announces visit to United Kingdom
The last papal visit was in May 1982 Pope Benedict XVI is to visit Britain in 2010, the BBC has learned. It will be the first papal visit to Britain since 1982, when Pope John Paul II's six-day tour drew huge crowds. The news of Pope Benedict's visit comes after Gordon Brown extended a formal invitation to the Pope during a private audience in February. A spokesman for the prime minister said he was "delighted" and "it would be a moving and momentous occasion for the whole country". Details of his visit have yet to emerge but the trip is set to be the first official state visit by a pontiff - John Paul II's visit in May 1982 was on a pastoral basis and did not follow an official invitation by the UK government. 'Warmly received' A spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: "The PM is obviously delighted at the prospect of a visit from Pope Benedict XVI to Britain. He said: "Such a visit - the first in over a quarter of a century - would be greatly welcomed not only by Roman Catholics but by the country as a whole."

Chess grandmasters Kasparov and Karpov play match in Spain
Tuesday, Garry Kasparov beat Anatoly Karpov in the first two games of a 12-game exhibition match in Valencia, Spain. The match is being held to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the first world championship match between the two players. That match was famously suspended after five months and 48 games. Kasparov went on win the title in 1985 and then defended it against Karpov in matches in 1986, 1987 and 1990. Kasparov and Karpov became enemies during those matches, but many years have passed and they have mellowed. In 2002, they played a four-game rapid match (time control of 25 minutes per player per game, with time added to each player’s clock after each move) in Times Square in New York City. At the time, Kasparov was still competing regularly and was still ranked No. Kasparov retired in 2005 and Karpov still competes, but Kasparov is 12 years younger and that is a considerable advantage. 1 if he was still playing, there is no doubt that he would still be among the world’s top players.

Testimony by John Travolta that son was autistic raises Scientology questions
share tweet email During court proceedings in the Bahamas on Sept. 22, John Travolta said that his 16-year-old son Jett, who died after a having a seizure in January, suffered from autism. “My son was autistic and he suffered from seizure disorder every five to 10 days,” Travolta told the court. This appeared to be the first time the actor has publicly recognized Jett’s autism — previously he’d said only that his son suffered from Kawasaki disease, a blood disorder. The fact that Travolta and wife Kelly Preston have not previously recognized their son’s autism has drawn criticism from many. Some have claimed that the Travoltas' longtime devotion to the Church of Scientology — which separates psychiatric conditions from medical conditions — has prevented them from being open about Jett’s autism. A source close to the Travolta family said that Jett’s autism “was more on the profound end of the autistic spectrum. “As with any medical condition, the Church believes that these matters are best diagnosed and treated by a medical doctor. Travolta’s testimony was part of an extortion trial that alleges that paramedic Tarrino Lightbourne and his attorney, Pleasant Bridgewater, a Bahamian senator, conspired to extort $25 million from Travolta in return for not publicizing a document that would indicate Travolta didn’t want Jett transported to a hospital. In the end, Jett was transported to the hospital, so the document seems moot — which is why some wonder why Travolta and Preston are going through the process of litigating.

Iran announces its building of a second nuclear power plant
Iran has been subjected to four rounds of United Nations Security Council sanctions in relation to its nuclear programme. In spite of this, it has continued its uranium enrichment operations and there is growing pressure for sanctions to be tightened further. The following are the UN resolutions relating to Iran's nuclear programme. DEMAND TO END ENRICHMENT - RESOLUTION 1696 In March 2006, the issue was discussed at the UN Security Council, which called for a report by the IAEA to establish Iran's compliance with the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The treaty allows for the use of nuclear technology for peaceful energy purposes, as long as countries can demonstrate that their programmes are not being used for the development of nuclear weapons. In July 2006, the Security Council said it was "seriously concerned" that the IAEA was unable to provide assurances about Iran's undeclared nuclear material. It demanded that Iran "suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development", giving it one month to do so. Failing that, it would face the possibility of economic and diplomatic sanctions. On this basis it said it rejected the validity of the Security Council's calls. It claimed that while subscribers to the NPT were being punished, those who had not signed up to the agreement were being rewarded by generous nuclear cooperation agreements. RESOLUTION 1696 FIRST ROUND OF SANCTIONS - RESOLUTION 1737 The deadline for Iranian compliance with the Security Council's demands passed without being heeded.

Over 700 killed after earthquake in Indonesia
Rescue and relief teams have been ordered to 'flood' Padang with aid [AFP] Rescue and relief teams have been ordered to 'flood' Padang with aid [AFP] Indonesia's health ministry has said it fears thousands of people may have died. Rescue operations Rick Cameron, the director of Island Aid, a disaster relief organisation in Indonesia, said he had been taken by surprise by the second tremor. He told Al Jazeera: "We all jumped up, ran to a grassy area outside the house. "It was extremely disorienting and shakes every perspective of what you think the world is." It was unclear how many injuries the second earthquake had caused, but Raphael Abreu, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey, told Al Jazeera that it had been "definitely capable of creating, by itself, significant damage to structures and property". Step Vaessen, Al Jazeera's correspondent reporting from Padang, said: "So far, the worst incident I've seen is 160 people buried at one location. "It's sporadic damage, but the damage is serious. High-rise buildings, many of which have collapsed totally or partially - so lots of people trapped ... but it is still hard to say how many have died. "I haven't seen many rescue workers active at all. I don't think there's enough equipment at the moment in Padang to conduct these operations." The UN said the death told had risen to 1,100 - up from 770 given by the disaster ministry.

British nursery worker admits sexually abusing children
The trio met on the social networking website Facebook A Plymouth nursery worker and two other people she met online have admitted a series of child sex abuse charges. Vanessa George, Angela Allen, from Nottingham, and Colin Blanchard, from Rochdale, all 39, had never met in person before they appeared in court. Abuse was recorded on mobile phones and images exchanged via e-mail and text. Police, who described the abuse as "horrific", are continuing to try to identify victims at George's nursery. Children's Secretary Ed Balls said it was a "deeply distressing and disturbing case" and he expected the serious case review to be completed as soon as possible. "It is vital we find out how an adult could abuse their position of trust in such an evil way and do everything we can to prevent this kind of abuse happening in the future," he said. Detective Superintendent Adrian Pearson, of Nottinghamshire Police, said the trio had been guilty of child abuse in its most "horrific and devilish form". "Those three individuals have shared quite willingly and freely images, texts, fantasies of the most serious level you could imagine," he said. "These three individuals each acted in a way which ordinary people will find hard to understand," she said. "They showed total disregard for the lives of their victims, their own families and those they worked with, all of whom have been left devastated by these crimes."

US unemployment rate reaches 9.8%
Employers cut another 263,000 jobs in September and the unemployment rate rose to a 26-year high of 9.8%, raising worries that the persistently weak labor market could undermine a nascent economic recovery from the worst U.S. recession since the Great Depression. The economy, by most accounts, has begun to grow again. But Friday's Labor Department report underscored the risk that without jobs, consumers won't have income to spend and... The endurance of hard times seems likely to increase pressure on the Obama administration and Congress to consider another dose of spending aimed at stimulating the economy, even as the government grapples with deficits projected by some economists to exceed $10 trillion over the next decade. Photo Despite a $787 billion stimulus package adopted early this year and aimed in part at shoring up state and local coffers, government jobs slipped by 53,000 in September. “That’s the budget crunch hitting,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.

Ireland votes 'Yes' to Lisbon Treaty
It was lashing with rain but that wasn't the full reason Paul Callaghan was finding it hard to muster up the enthusiasm to mark his X. "I'm here because I have a vote and, basically, I've been told what to do with it," he said gloomily as he stood outside one of Dublin's polling stations in O'Connell Street on Saturday afternoon. "Look at the state we are in now," he said. "A year ago I had a job, life was rosy. Every time I turn on the television some politician tells me that only the EU can save this country now. I don't want to do it, I feel disloyal, but today I am voting yes. It isn't how I voted 16 months ago, but I've been left feeling I have no choice." Bowed and more bloodied than most by the recession, and with its government's finances reeling under 20 million euros of debt, Mr Callaghan, like most of the Irish, did on Friday as he was told by Europe and reversed his earlier rejection of the controversial Treaty by voting yes. With more than half a million unemployed and the country now deep in recession, the majority of Ireland's electorate clearly felt they now had no choice but to switch allegiance and, reluctantly, come out in support of the European Union – presumably in the hope that it can help its failing fortunes. "The whole Celtic Tiger image is dead," said Mr Callaghan, a former store manager, as he stood among a disgruntled group of voters.

BBC receives 487 complaints after 'Dancing' race row
Total complaints up by almost 200 after Strictly Come Dancing host says nation should get a 'sense of humour' about race row Complaints about Strictly Come Dancing star Anton Du Beke's racist remarks have shot up after the show's host, Bruce Forsyth, intervened in the row. The BBC said it had received 686 complaints as of this morning, up almost 200 on yesterday's total of 487. The complaints against the show – sparked by Du Beke calling his dancing partner Laila Rouass a "Paki" in rehearsals – had been tailing off. But after Forsyth told the TalkSport radio station that the nation should get a "sense of humour" about the incident yesterday, viewers rang in again to complain. The BBC said they had also been registering their support for Du Beke, with a total of 63 saying the row had been blown out of proportion, more than double the 30 who had called by yesterday. The controversy began at the weekend when it emerged that Du Beke had told Rouass she "looked like a Paki" after turning up to a rehearsal with a spray tan. Rouass accepted Du Beke's subsequent apology, and the BBC hoped the row would die down, despite accusations of double-standards over its treatment of Carol Thatcher in a similar incident earlier in the year. In his unscheduled radio appearance yesterday, Forsyth said: "We used to have a sense of humour about this.

Turkey and Armenia sign historic agreement
The two countries signed the protocols under the watchful eyes of big powers Turkey and Armenia have signed a historic accord normalising relations after a century of hostility. The deal was signed by the two foreign ministers after last-minute problems delayed the ceremony in Switzerland. Under the agreement, Turkey and Armenia are to establish diplomatic ties and reopen their shared border. The accord has been met by protests in Armenia, where many people say it does not fully address the 1915 killing of hundreds of thousands of Armenians. Objections Armenia wants Turkey to recognise the killings as an act of genocide, but successive Turkish governments have refused to do so. The agreement calls for a joint commission, also including international experts, to examine the "historical dimension" of the two countries' relations. ANALYSIS Kim Ghattas, BBC News, Zurich Turkey and Armenia both have an interest in turning the page - the economy of landlocked Armenia would benefit from access to Turkey. Ties with Turkey, a key American ally, have come under strain repeatedly because of the million and a half Armenian Americans who have lobbied for a draft resolution in the US Congress to name the World War I killings as genocide. Clinton put to the test Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and his Armenian counterpart, Edward Nalbandian, signed the protocols in Switzerland after a delay of more than three hours. The BBC's Kim Ghattas in Zurich says the Armenians had apparently raised objections to remarks due to be read out by the Turkish delegation.

6-year-old boy in Colorado found alive, unhurt after runaway balloon allegedly carried him away
The tale of the experimental helium air balloon sailing above the Colorado plains for two hours on Thursday afternoon captivated the nation, and it had as many twists and turns as the strange flight. The Lede blog followed the developments. So what does a 6-year-old boy hiding in an attic for several hours do to occupy his time as his parents, the police and throngs of investigators are frantically searching for him? Appearing on “Larry King Live” on Thursday night with his parents and brothers, Falcon Heene gave some indication. “Whenever we tell him things like ‘It’s a bad thing to do,’ he does go and hide,” he said. “He cowers down, and like if we go to the store and he wants to buy some candy or something, I have to tell him no and he’s always behind and the boys are always saying ‘Come on, Falcon, hurry up.’ ” Police officers and county investigators scoured Falcon Heene’s home twice during the nerve-wracking, air and ground search for him Thursday afternoon. So how did a 6-year-old boy manage to elude so many people for over three hours? On Thursday evening, Sheriff Jim Alderden of Larimer County explained that Falcon had been crawling in and out of a small battery compartment — about one and a half feet by four feet wide — on his father’s balloon contraption throughout the morning. When the balloon eventually came loose and floated away, Falcon was nowhere to be found, and his family assumed he was in the battery compartment. “The rafters of the garage are partially open and partially enclosed, and the garage is just full of stuff on the floor,” Sheriff Alderden said. “Apparently what happened is that he climbed up on some boxes and grabbed hold of the rafters and pulled himself up into the rafters.” There, he kept quiet for hours and remained out of the reach of the investigators searching just feet away.

Mark Webber wins 2009 Brazilian Grand Prix, Jenson Button and Brawn win championship
A first lap containing spins, shunts and a pit-lane fireball – more incidents, in fact, than most entire races – set the scene for today's Brazilian grand prix, an absorbing contest in which the celebrations were shared by Mark Webber, winning for the second time this season in his Red Bull-Renault, and Jenson Button, whose fifth place brought him and the Brawn-Mercedes team the double of the 2009 world drivers' and constructors' championships. Given the testing circumstances, Button's drive was the equal of the very best of the six victories he collected in the first half of the see-sawing season. After a catastrophic qualifying session he took his fate into his own hands and drove with controlled aggression. When the slightest mistake would have meant disaster, he executed a series of overtaking manoeuvres with measured authority. At the start of the afternoon the permutations were almost endless. A podium finish would secure the title for Button but a poor tyre choice on Saturday reduced him to 14th place on the grid and gave hope to his team-mate Rubens Barrichello, starting from pole position in front of his home crowd. Adrian Sutil's Force India, starting from third on the grid, was overtaken by Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari as the cars plunged through the dramatic downhill esses and then tangled with Jarno Trulli's Toyota at high speed, putting both cars out. The Italian veteran, believing he had been edged off the track, confronted the young German with a series of gestures suggesting that they might be meeting again to sort it out away from the public gaze. The stewards ruled that it had been a racing incident but fined Trulli $10,000 for refusing to leave the track and for the manner of his confrontion with Sutil. The McLaren driver, however, restarted with the fuel hose still attached (for which the team were fined $50,000), covering his fellow Finn's Ferrari in a film of petrol which ignited in a spectacular blaze that momentarily blinded Raikkonen but was quickly extinguished by the airflow as he accelerated away.

BBC's Mock The Week 'breached guidelines' with Olympian humour, say corporation's Trust
Mock The Week has been screened since 2005 Satirical gameshow Mock The Week breached guidelines over comments aired about swimmer Rebecca Adlington, the BBC Trust has ruled. Panellist Frankie Boyle's remarks about the Olympic champion were "humiliating" and "risked offending the audience". The show, broadcast in August 2008 in the wake of the Beijing Olympics, prompted 75 complaints from viewers. Its producer apologised in December, saying "the ribbing may have gone a tad too far on this occasion". Final ruling The trust's Editorial Standards Committee also concluded that double gold medallist Adlington had not courted publicity or celebrity status, making the personal remarks unjustified. They added that the makers of Mock The Week, who allowed sexual innuendo and comments about Adlington's appearance to be included, failed to have an editorial reason for including them. The committee's decision is a final ruling on a complaints process that has been in progress since last year. Another complaint against Mock The Week, relating to a comment made about the Queen, was not upheld as a breach of editorial standards by the trust. The BBC recently announced that Boyle was stepping down from the show after seven series to concentrate on other commitments. The Scottish comedian, known for his dour, cutting humour, was called "a brilliant member of the team" by a spokesman for the programme. Meanwhile, BBC Three's Most Annoying People of 2008 show was found by the Editorial Standards Committee to have made "crude and offensive" jokes about the lesbian relationship between actress Lindsay Lohan and DJ Sam Ronson. Remarks made by radio host Spoony and porn actor Ron Jeremy were deemed to be "crude and offensive" and appeared to "reinforce stereotypical views", it ruled. The committee has asked for the remarks to be removed from any repeats of the programme.

Ukraine closes schools after reports of swine flu deaths
The Americas have seen the sharpest rise in swine flu deaths The number of swine flu deaths reported worldwide has jumped by more than 700 in a week, latest World Health Organization figures reveal. More than 5,700 swine flu deaths were reported by 25 October, compared to nearly 5,000 the week before. The biggest rise was in the Americas where 4,175 deaths have been reported, up 636 from the week before. Meanwhile, Ukraine has shut all schools and banned public meetings for three weeks after its first swine flu death. Mrs Tymoshenko said there would also be restrictions on what she called non-urgent travel between different parts of Ukraine. But the organisation said that as many countries have stopped counting individual cases, the actual number is likely to be significantly higher. The BBC's Imogen Foulkes says the WHO has warned for months that as winter sets in, the northern hemisphere can expect swine flu cases to rise. The virus emerged in Mexico in April and was declared a global flu pandemic on 11 June. "In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza transmission continues to intensify, marking an unusually early start to winter influenza season in some countries," said the WHO's latest update. In a separate statement, the WHO said that experts meeting this week had concluded that a single dose of swine flu vaccine was sufficient to immunise adults and children over 10. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (Sage) said that countries that had made vaccinating children a priority could administer them a single dose to ensure that as many as possible are immunised quickly.

"It was the right decision, and I did it in the best interests of this country," Abdullah said. "As far as the process is concerned, hopefully there is a way forward. I will not enter into the constitutional implications of this decision. Perhaps, after a sigh of relief, I will enter into this role with my followers, with my supporters, with the movement that has supported me for the past five months." Shortly after Abdullah's announcement, the campaign team of Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, said the election would still go ahead. "His [Abdullah's] withdrawal should not alter the process... The process should go on and the people of Afghanistan should be given the chance to vote," Wahid Omar, a Karzai spokesman, told Al Jazeera. Illegitimate government  In Sunday's statements, Abdullah said a "transparent election is not possible" and that the Afghan government has been illegitimate since May. The supreme court, appointed by Karzai, extended his mandate after the election was put off from last spring until August. Earlier, Karzai had rejected a series of demands laid down by Abdullah, who previously served as foreign minister in his cabinet. James Bays, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Kabul, said many Afghans had told him that an election with only one candidate would be "farcical".

Dr Abdullah, who had demanded the removal of key poll officials, said the vote would not have been fair. The first round had been marred by fraud. ANALYSIS Andrew North, BBC News, Kabul The announcement that the run-off vote was being cancelled had been widely expected. All reports suggested it was simply a question of finding the legal means to bring the process to an end. The point of holding a second round was to try to restore some legitimacy to the process after there was so much fraud - almost a third of votes for President Karzai were invalidated because of massive ballot stuffing. It is a very unsatisfactory end, not the end anyone here wished for. At the moment it is being seen as the best of a lot of bad options. On Monday a spokesman for the Independent Election Commission (IEC), Azizullah Lodin, declared that President Karzai, "the only candidate for the second round", had been "elected president of Afghanistan".

Afghan policeman shoots and kills five British soldiers
Advertisement Five British soldiers have been shot dead in Helmand Province, in an attack the UK military blamed on a "rogue" Afghan policeman. The soldiers, three from the Grenadier Guards and two from the Royal Military Police, had been mentoring and living with the Afghan police in a compound. The officer opened fire, injuring eight others, before fleeing the compound. Gordon Brown told MPs the Taliban said they had carried out the attack and may have infiltrated Afghan police. Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister said evidence was being gathered and security would be stepped up after the shooting. But he added that training of Afghan police remained an "essential element" of the strategy in Afghanistan and would not be stopped as it was "what the Taliban fears most". Manhunt A total of 92 UK service personnel have now been killed this year, the highest annual figure since the Falklands War in 1982. An investigation is under way and the soldiers' next of kin have been informed of the deaths. A UK military spokesman said: "One individual Afghan National Policeman, possibly in conjunction with another, went rogue. Every effort is now being put into hunting down those responsible for this attack." BBC Kabul correspondent Ian Pannell said sources had indicated the attacker was a police officer called Gulbuddin who had fled the scene after the shooting.

Political fallout from the sacking of Professor David Nutt gathers momentum
A second adviser to the government has resigned in protest at Home Secretary Alan Johnson's sacking of his chief drugs adviser, Prof David Nutt. Marion Walker's departure from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) followed the earlier resignation of Dr Les King. Dr King said he would like to see the ACMD become an independent body, free from the government's influence. Mr Johnson said Prof Nutt was sacked for "crossing a line" into politics. On Sunday, Prof Nutt revealed Ms Walker, ACMD member from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, had stepped down. However, she could not be reached for comment. I'm not going to say just how many I think might resign but there is an extremely angry feeling among most council members Dr Les King Ms Walker is clinical director of Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust's substance misuse service. Prof Nutt said her departure "means we have no-one now looking at that vast group of people who prescribe drugs and advise people about drugs, drug harms from the over-the-counter and prescription side". The BBC understands that several other members of the ACMD, who are unpaid for their work on the council, are considering their positions, in response to Prof Nutt's dismissal. Prof Nutt was sacked after calling cannabis less harmful than alcohol and tobacco, and saying it was upgraded to Class B for political reasons. 'Angry feeling' The reclassification had been "on the whim of the prime minister", he claimed. HAVE YOUR SAY Scientific advisers should advise; ministers should then make decisions based on that advice... This sorry lot can't even get that right Steve, Fordingbridge, UK There was "very strong feeling" among the council's members over Prof Nutt's sacking, Dr King said.

Toyota quits Formula One
The loss of another giant company from the F1 grid may help smaller, independent teams to survive and thrive in the long run Toyota's decision to quit Formula One is a sign of a 32-year low in car sales in Japan and huge losses for the world's largest motor manufacturer. It is not, however, another nail in the coffin of Formula One. If anything, the loss of another manufacturer on the heels of Honda and BMW hints at a slow return towards the smaller independent team such as Williams and Brawn with racing as its core business. When Honda quit in December 2008, Toyota were expected to follow sooner rather than later. But the racing team's signature on a new Concorde agreement – the latest document governing Formula One until the end of 2012 – indicated a serious commitment despite Toyota not having won a race since the Japanese firm's move from international rallying to Formula One in 2002. The first hint of prevarication came last month when Toyota did not rush to re-sign Jarno Trulli and Timo Glock, although discussions with Kimi Raikkonen (leaving Ferrari) gave the impression that the team would continue. Estimates of Toyota's F1 budget vary but an annual figure of £300m would be close to an expensive mark for a team who have recorded just 13 podium finishes and, at best, fourth in the 2005 championship after 139 races. It is a sign of the huge losses at home that the Toyota Motor Corporation is willing to deal with the redundancy associated with more than 700 people at the team's headquarters in Cologne as well as facing compensation costs for breaking its commitment to stay in F1. Toyota, like Honda, struggled to make the F1 operation work thanks to a failure to understand that racing teams think on their feet rather than rely on cumbersome corporate decision-making by a committee thousands of miles away. Honda were bought out by the team management and BMW have been taken over by the mysterious Qadbak Holdings. The only good news is that Toyota's withdrawal leaves a space on the entry list for BMW to return in their new guise. Even though Toyota's F1 budget is minuscule in the firm's overall scheme of finance, motor manufacturers cannot afford to be seen to be spending money on a sport that may be considered frivolous when vast losses and redundancies are occurring within the core business.

Thirteen dead, several wounded in Fort Hood, Texas shooting
Fort Hood, the largest base in the US, was put under lockdown in the wake of the shootings [AFP] Fort Hood, the largest base in the US, was put under lockdown in the wake of the shootings [AFP] The dead gunman had been named as Major Malik Nadal Hasan, a 39-year-old army psychiatrist. Al Jazeera's Josh Rushing, reporting from Fort Hood, said there was no indication of motive for the unprecedented attack, which he said had left an atmosphere of "shock and fear" at the base. Recent US mass shootings April 3, 2009: Jiverly Wong, a Vietnamese immigrant, opens fire at an immigrant community centre in Binghamton, New York, killing 11 immigrants and two workers. Wong killed himself at the scene  March 10, 2009: Michael McLendon, 28, killed 10 people, including his Mother and four other family members in Alabama before himself committing suicide.

According to military officials, Hasan had been about to deploy overseas, although it was unclear if he was destined for Iraq or Afghanistan or when he was scheduled to leave. Christopher Hogue, chief of media at Fort Hood, told reporters: "The only one we know who was shooting was killed and he had two handguns." The alleged shooter was included in the total of 12 killed. "It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an army base on American soil," he said in Washington.

UN endorses Israel-Palestinian war crimes report
Most of the report's criticism was directed towards Israel's conduct during the Gaza offensive [AFP] Most of the report's criticism was directed towards Israel's conduct during the Gaza offensive [AFP] Most of the report's criticism was directed towards Israel's conduct during the Gaza offensive [AFP] The report calls on both Israel and the Palestinians to investigate within three months accusations of human-rights violations during the 22-day conflict in December and January. Most of the criticism in the Goldstone report was directed towards Israel's conduct during the offensive, in which human rights organisations say about 1,400 Palestinians - many of them women and children - were killed. Thirteen Israelis, including three civilians, were killed over the course of the war. The report concluded that Israel used disproportionate force in the war, deliberately targeting Gaza civilians, using them as human shields, and destroying civilian infrastructure. Offensive conduct Ali Treki, the General Assembly president, called the vote "an important declaration against impunity. It is a call for justice and accountability". "Without justice, there can be no progress towards peace. A human being should be treated as a human being, regardless of his or her religion, race or nationality," he said. Apart from Israel and the US, a number of European countries including Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic, voted against the resolution. The Netherlands' representative said, however, he supported elements in the text, which sought to pursue inquiries into violations of human rights and international law. Nassir Abdulaziz al-Nasser, Qatar's ambassador to the UN, said the Goldstone report pointed to crimes committed by the Israel that amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, torture and serious physical and psychological harm to civilians. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian UN observer called it "an important night in the history of the General Assembly and the history of fighting against impunity and seeking accountability".

China offers Africa financial aid including $10 billion in loans
China has cultivated strong economic ties with Africa China has pledged to give Africa $10bn (£6bn) in concessional loans over the next three years, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has said at a summit in Egypt. The Chinese leader is attending a two-day forum on China-Africa cooperation in Sharm el-Sheikh, attended by officials from 50 nations. "We will help Africa build up financing capacity," Mr Wen told the summit. Several heads of state and government are attending the meeting, including the Presidents of Sudan and Zimbabwe. Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak inaugurated the forum, the fourth of its kind, and spoke of "peace, security and growth," and of "boosting cooperation between China and Africa." Mr Wen also said China is planning to create environmental programmes for Africa, including 100 clean energy projects. Advertisement The West has previously accused China of plundering Africa's natural resources - to fuel its booming economy - and of overlooking the human rights records of some governments they do business with. In the run up to the summit, China's state owned Global Times newspaper wrote "The West is envious of China and Africa drawing closer," and quoted one Chinese Africa expert as saying "Europeans view Africa as their own backyard." China pledged $5bn (£3bn) of assistance at the last cooperation summit in Beijing in 2006, and signed agreements to relieve or cancel the debt of more than 30 African countries. In his speech, Wen highly valued the fruitful achievements China and Africa have made through bilateral economic and trade cooperation. He said past practices had proved that the traditional friendship between China and Africa was "unbreakable," and their economic and trade cooperation was based on equality and mutual benefit.

Korean navies exchange fire
SEOUL, South Korea  North and South Korean naval vessels exchanged fire in disputed waters off the western coast of the Korean Peninsula on Tuesday, leaving one North Korean vessel engulfed in flames, South Korean officials said. One North Korean sailor was killed and three others injured, according to MBC, a South Korean television station. The South Korean defense minister, Kim Tae-young, told Parliament that he could not confirm the report. The two Koreas accused each other of violating territorial waters, provoking the fierce two-minute skirmish. It was the first border fighting in seven years between the countries, which technically remain at war after fighting in the 1950-3 Korean War ended in a truce rather than a permanent peace treaty. The clash underlined the instability in the region just days before President Obama begins a weeklong visit to Asia. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program will be a leading topic not only when Mr. Obama meets with the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, in Seoul next week but also during bilateral talks that American officials say they will begin soon with the North. Ahead of those talks, North Korea may have intended for the clash to highlight its longstanding argument that the war between the Koreas from 1950-53 never officially ended and that the United States must negotiate a peace treaty if it wants North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, according to analysts in Seoul. “We are fully prepared for further provocations from the North Korean military.” Speaking in Parliament, Prime Minister Chung Un-chan said the North Korean boat limped back to its waters “enveloped in flames.” Hours later, North Korea demanded an apology from the South for a “grave armed provocation.” According to South Korean officials, fighting erupted when a 215-ton North Korean vessel ventured across the so-called Northern Limit Line, a sea border drawn by the United Nations at the end of the war.

Three more scientists resign from UK ACMD drugs advisory council
Alan Johnson failed in an attempt to defuse the damaging row between the Government and Britain's top scientists after three more of his drugs advisers resigned last night. The Home Secretary suffered a setback when another three members of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs resigned despite his efforts to reassure them in more than an hour of peace talks that the Government would respect the independence of its expert advisers. The growing rift between ministers and the scientific community was sparked by Mr Johnson's decision to sack the body's chairman, Professor David Nutt, for allegedly campaigning against the Government's decision to upgrade cannabis to a Class B drug. Another two members of the 31-strong council, Marion Walker and Dr Les King, resigned in protest and they were joined by three more members last night, leaving the group without experts in key areas of expertise. Chemist Dr Simon Campbell, psychologist Dr John Marsden and scientific consultant Ian Ragan quit after arguing unsuccessfully for Professor Nutt to be reinstated. Allies of Mr Johnson said they were saddened by the resignations but insisted the Council was still viable and that most of its members wanted to carry on their vital work. It is believed the Council was divided after yesterday's tense session with Mr Johnson. Some members wanted to accept his safeguards over their future work but others remained unhappy, accusing the Government of prejudging the review of cannabis ordered by Gordon Brown when he became Prime Minister. The drug was upgraded from Class C to B last year even though the Council opposed the move.

Herman Van Rompuy named as first permanent EU President
Mr Van Rompuy was widely tipped, but Baroness Ashton was not EU leaders have chosen the Belgian Prime Minister, Herman van Rompuy, to be the first permanent European Council President. The other top job created by the Lisbon Treaty - foreign affairs supremo - has gone to the EU Trade Commissioner, Baroness Catherine Ashton from the UK. Both are seen as consensual politicians with limited foreign policy experience. Both had unanimous backing from the 27 EU leaders at the summit in Brussels, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. Earlier, the UK government had said it was no longer pushing for former PM Tony Blair to get the presidency post. He has a reputation as a coalition builder, having taken charge of the linguistically divided Belgian government and steered it out of a crisis. "Every country should emerge victorious from negotiations," he told a news conference after his appointment. "Even if unity remains our strength, our diversity remains our wealth," he said, stressing the individuality of EU member states. Baroness Ashton, 53, said she felt "deeply privileged" to get the foreign affairs post. "I was the first woman British commissioner, the first woman trade commissioner, so I am also proud to be the first woman High Representative," she said. "I think there was a strong push to have at least one woman in a senior position," she told the BBC later, adding that she hoped Europe would become "an economic superpower".

US healthcare bill passes Senate vote
The U.S. Senate, by a vote of 60 to 39, has decided to begin debate on legislation crafted by majority Democrats to reform the country's health care system. The measure, opposed by Republican senators, was voted on late Saturday. One Republican Senator, George Voinovich of Ohio, was not present and did not vote. It was not clear until earlier in the day whether the Democrats would have enough votes to bring the bill to the Senate floor for for full debate. During the day Saturday, two moderate Democrats announced they would support the move during a rare Saturday session. That gave the Democrats the 60 votes they needed to move the measure forward. The legislation aims to extend health care coverage to millions of uninsured people, prevent insurance companies from denying benefits, and limit the growth of spending on medical care. In the rare Saturday Senate session, opposition Republicans criticized the bill, saying it would drive up the cost of insurance and add to the nation's deficit. In a statement, Gibbs said the president looks forward to a thorough and productive debate. While Democrats won the vote to begin debate, passage of the bill is not certain. Some moderate Democrats have signaled strong opposition to components of the bill, including a government-run option to compete with private insurers. However, the Senate version does allow states to opt out of the public option.

British Climatic Research Unit's emails hacked
The scientific community is buzzing over thousands of emails and documents -- posted on the Internet last week after being hacked from a prominent climate-change research center -- that some say raise ethical questions about a group of scientists who contend humans are responsible for global warming. The correspondence between dozens of climate-change researchers, including many in the U.S., illustrates bitter feelings among those who... Hundreds of private e-mail messages and documents hacked from a computer server at a British university are causing a stir among global warming skeptics, who say they show that climate scientists conspired to overstate the case for a human influence on climate change. The e-mail messages, attributed to prominent American and British climate researchers, include discussions of scientific data and whether it should be released, exchanges about how best to combat the arguments of skeptics, and casual comments  in some cases derisive  about specific people known for their skeptical views. In another, a scientist refers to climate skeptics as “idiots.” Some skeptics asserted Friday that the correspondence revealed an effort to withhold scientific information. “This is not a smoking gun; this is a mushroom cloud,” said Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist who has long faulted evidence pointing to human-driven warming and is criticized in the documents. Some of the correspondence portrays the scientists as feeling under siege by the skeptics’ camp and worried that any stray comment or data glitch could be turned against them. The evidence pointing to a growing human contribution to global warming is so widely accepted that the hacked material is unlikely to erode the overall argument. In several e-mail exchanges, Kevin Trenberth, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other scientists discuss gaps in understanding of recent variations in temperature. Skeptic Web sites pointed out one line in particular: “The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t,” Dr. Trenberth wrote. The cache of e-mail messages also includes references to journalists, including this reporter, and queries from journalists related to articles they were reporting.

Israel announces 10 month halt to settlement construction in West Bank
Al Jazeera's Jacky Rowland, reporting from Jerusalem, said that the suspension would only apply to "new residential permits and new residential starts". "We are only talking about housing here. This freeze does not apply to public buildings such as schools or police stations or whatever, and it also means any existing building permits that have been granted they will go ahead," she said. "Any construction which has already begun, any construction sites where the cement mixers are already whirring and the cranes are at work they will continue." Palestinian rejection  A spokesman for Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, earlier dismissed the Israeli plan after details of it were outlined in a statement from Netanyahu's office. "Any return to negotiations must be on the basis of a complete settlement freeze, and in Jerusalem foremost," Nabil Abu Rdainah said. Referring to Jerusalem in Wednesday's news conference, Netanyahu said: "My position it is well known, I do not impose any restriction on building in Jerusalem." The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, has refused to return to peace talks with the Israelis until Netanyahu orders a complete freeze to all settlement building work in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Before Netanyahu's news conference, Ehud Barak, the Israeli defence minister, told the security cabinet that the proposal was an attempt to "keep open a window to the resumption of the negotiation process" with the Palestinians. "Israel is strong and determined, but time is not necessarily on our side, and it is important to move towards two states for two people, through agreement. "It falls short of a full settlement freeze, but it is more than any Israeli government has done before," he said. "It falls short of a full settlement freeze, but it is more than any Israeli government has done before" George Mitchell, US special Middle East envoy "As President Obama has said many times, we believe that a two-state solution to the conflict is the best way to realise the shared goal of Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security.

US President Obama delivers address on Afghanistan plan
Advertisement US President Barack Obama has ordered 30,000 more US troops to Afghanistan but warned America would begin to withdraw its military forces by 2011. Soldiers will be deployed as quickly as possible, bringing US troop strength in the country to more than 100,000. World security was at stake, Mr Obama said, calling for more allied troops. The mission in Afghanistan, he added, was to defeat al-Qaeda, reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny them the ability to overthrow the government. Just as we have done in Iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly Barack Obama Full text of speech Nato pledges 5,000 Afghan troops US media on the troop surge Afghan concern over pullout date Mr Obama reached his deployment decision after more than three months of deliberations and 10 top-level meetings with advisers. Gen Stanley McChrystal, the US commander in Afghanistan, welcomed the speech, saying he had been given "a clear military mission" and the necessary resources. Some 32,000 other foreign troops are serving in Afghanistan but Nato allies have been cautious about further contributions. He told reporters on Wednesday that 5,000 extra troops would be sent in 2010, and "probably" a few thousand in addition. "This is our fight together," he said. Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta said that with international help Afghanistan's armed forces would be able to start taking responsibility for security in 18 months.

Guinean military leader in 'favourable' condition after attempted assassination
Morocco says Guinea's military ruler has undergone successful surgery for gunshot wounds sustained on Thursday in an apparent assassination attempt. Guinea's military government is offering a reward for the capture of the former head of the presidential guard whose men are accused of carrying out the attack. The inspector of Morocco's Royal Armed Forces' health services says Guinea's military ruler Captain Moussa Dadis Camara has had successful surgery for head trauma. In a statement issued by Morocco's official press agency, Dr. Ali Abrouq said Captain Camara's condition is "not worrying." Captain Camara flew to Morocco on Friday after being shot the day before by men loyal to his former aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Aboubacar Sidiki Diakite, who is also known as Toumba. Toumba escaped the attack and is still at large with a group of the presidential guard. The government is offering a reward for information leading to his capture. Toumba's photograph is being broadcast on national television. Thursday's shooting followed an argument between Toumba and Captain Camara about who should take responsibility for the killing of opposition demonstrators two months ago. Captain Camara has not yet announced his candidacy, but he has told several regional diplomats that he intends to run for president.

Copenhagen climate conference opens
Prime minister tells the Guardian he hopes the EU will agree to a cut in emissions of 30% by 2020 Gordon Brown is pushing European leaders to commit to deeper cuts in carbon emissions in an attempt to seal a global deal, he revealed as representatives of 192 countries began negotiations at the climate change summit in Copenhagen. The prime minister told the Guardian he hoped the EU would agree to cut its output of greenhouse gases by 30% on 1990 levels by 2020 – a cut 10 percentage points deeper than Europe is currently offering. So far, the EU has said it will cut by 30% only if an ambitious global deal is reached. Brown said: "We've got to make countries recognise that they have to be as ambitious as they say they want to be. It's not enough to say 'I may do this, I might do this, possibly I'll do this'. I want to create a situation in which the European Union is persuaded to go to 30%." Because the UK is already racing to build renewable energy as fast as it can, the additional cuts would probably require measures such as road charging, increased fuel taxes and tougher emissions standards for cars. On the opening day of the Copenhagen summit Saudi Arabia's chief climate negotiator, Mohammed al-Sabban, told delegates that the scandal over hacked emails from University of East Anglia researchers had undermined confidence in the science of climate change and would "affect the nature of what can be trusted in the negotiations". But after lambasting climate deniers as "flat-earth sceptics" and "anti-change Luddites", Brown would say only that he "fundamentally disagrees" with Sabban, who last week said he believed there was no link between human behaviour and warming. But it warned that development at other regional airports such as Gatwick, Birmingham and Newcastle would have to be curbed if growth in aviation was to be kept to 60% rather than the 200% by which it would expand if allowed to go unchecked.

Danish unofficial draft version of UNCCC treaty leaks, G77 reacts sharply
By Richard Black Environment correspondent, BBC News website, Copenhagen The leaked text has overshadowed the first day's upbeat speeches Earth Watch - Richard Black's blog Documents leaked at the UN climate summit reveal divisions between industrialised and developing countries over the shape of a possible new deal. Campaigners say a draft text proposed by the Danish host government would disadvantage poorer nations. It also sees everything coming under a single new deal, whereas an alternative text from developing countries wants an extension to the Kyoto Protocol. Other blocs are expected to release their own texts in the next few days. Chairmen of working groups will then have to turn the various documents into a political document that 100-odd world leaders, plus delegates representing all other nations, could sign at the end of the conference. The Danish document, plus the alternative text submitted by the BASIC group (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) were discussed by a small group of key countries in Copenhagen last week. But the Danish proposal had remained under wraps until The Guardian newspaper published it on its website during the second afternoon of the conference. More ambition The documents show that at the broadest level, developed and developing worlds are split on several points: the level of cuts from developed countries the establishment of a target date by which global emissions should peak and begin to fall most fundamentally, the shape of any future deal. Although this might appear a technical point, developing countries have so far remained adamant on the retention of the protocol because of the measures it contains on financial assistance and technology transfer, and because it is the only legally binding treaty in existence that makes countries reduce emissions. The only formal texts in the UN process are the ones tabled by the Chairs of this Copenhagen conference at the behest of the parties Yvo de Boer, UNFCCC executive secretary Copenhagen: Your questions The Danish text sets out a vision of greenhouse gas emissions peaking globally by 2020, then declining.

Oxford to use online voting for Professor of Poetry election
Oxford University tonight announced changes to the centuries-old tradition of voting for its professor of poetry post, instead introducing processes that bring it something closer to the 21st century. The vote, every five years, has been called a "kamikaze convention", and this year descended into embarrassing farce when Ruth Padel felt compelled to resign after nine days in the job. For some, the arcane voting rules are the problem. Any member of Oxford's convocation, which includes all 300,000 or so Oxford graduates, can vote as long as they turn up in person on a given day. Oxford hopes to avoid a repeat of this year's election which saw Padel quit after she was implicated in a smear campaign against her main rival, Derek Walcott. Walcott, a Nobel laureate, pulled out of the election when details of a sexual harassment claim made against him by a student at Harvard in 1982 became a dominant theme of the campaign. Oxford now hopes to fill the post, vacant since Sir Christopher Ricks finished his five-year term last year, by autumn 2010. But some believe the voting changes could make the election even more of a bun fight. Judith Palmer, director of the Poetry Society, said: "It just feels like they are not addressing the bigger problems. The contest is notoriously bruising, and there have been many excellent poets who would not dream of putting themselves forward because they don't want to take part in the showbiz aspect of it all. These changes will probably increase the number of good candidates ruling themselves out."

Thousands of Indonesians protest against corruption
Though activists predicted that hundreds of thousands would march Wednesday against corruption in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, only a few thousand turned up. Most were students protesting the latest corruption scandal in the country. It involves allegations that a $600 million government bailout was given to Century Bank on condition that some of the money be used to fund the president's re-election campaign. The legislature is investigating the bailout and the possible roles played by Vice President Boediono and Finance Minister Sri Mulyani in orchestrating a deal. Many of the demonstrators, like Ridwan Laodabone with a Muslim student organization, already consider the vice president and finance minister guilty. He says he wants the president to fire those two officials. He says those involved in corruption should be shot to death. Most rallies were without incident but in Makassar in South Sulawesi, students armed with rocks and wooden planks clashed with anti-riot police. On Saturday President Suslio Bambang Yudhoyono was critical of some anti-corruption activists, saying they are politically motivated and want only to discredit and topple his presidency.

Protesters arrested at climate change rally
Thousands of people march as part of a global protest to demand that governments agree a new climate deal Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Copenhagen today as part of a global protest to demand governments across the world agree a binding new global deal to tackle climate change. The march and rally in the Danish capital, the world's largest ever protest about global warming, comes at the halfway point of the United Nations' climate summit in the city. "Let's dance, sing and be happy, because power is in your hands," Nnimmo Bassey, director of Friends of the Earth International told the crowd, as he kicked off the first part of the march, the Flood, from Halmtorvet. Official police estimates put the number of protesters at 25,000, but organisers said as many as 100,000 had joined the march from central Copenhagen, waving banners that read "Nature doesn't compromise" and "Climate Justice Now". Although most of the march has been peaceful, a small group threw bricks at police early on. So far there have been 21 arrests, and police are currrently kettling about 200-300 marchers in Amagerbrogade. To mark the Global Day of Action on climate change, campaigners were also staging events around the world, including a four-minute "flashdance" with lights outside the Houses of Parliament, with volunteers across London collecting messages from citizens to deliver to MPs. Phil Thornhill, from the Campaign against Climate Change in the UK, said on behalf of the Global Climate Campaign: "Every year of inaction sees us slide closer to the point where a tragedy of unprecedented scale becomes irreversible. "As politicians fail to find the collective will to overcome inertia, international rivalries, and the all-pervasive power of vested interests, ordinary people all around the world will be demanding decisive action now, not later when the fate of billions could be already have been sealed and the catastrophe will have become unstoppable." She told Sky News it was "inspiring", adding: "It's fantastic to join with so many other people from all over the world.

North Korean weapons seized in Thailand
Thailand will charge detained crew members with crimes related to trafficking the 35-ton arms shipment in violation of sanctions slapped on North Korea for its missile and nuclear tests. Thai authorities have intercepted a cache of grenades, rocket launchers, and other heavy arms from North Korea after the plane carrying them was forced to land in Bangkok for fuel. Acting on a tip from the United States and in line with United Nations sanctions, Thailand is now trying to piece together where the weapons were headed. The five crew members, four with Kazakh passports and one from Belarus, have all been arrested but remained tight-lipped. Thailand will charge them with crimes related to trafficking the 35-ton arms shipment in violation of sanctions slapped on North Korea for its missile and nuclear tests in spring, reports Reuters. One Sri Lankan military official told Reuters, "Why should Sri Lanka buy from North Korea when the same is available in China?" This is the first time a North Korean plane has been caught in the UN dragnet since its spring resolution imposing sanctions. India in August detained a North Korean vessel it deemed suspicious, but it turned out to be full of sugar. A month prior, a North Korean boat appeared to be headed for Burma (Myanmar) high-tailed it home after being trailed by the US Navy. The Thai foreign ministry has announced it will report the arms seizure the the UN in 45 days, as required under the resolution, reports The Nation in Bangkok. "If the Thai government's announcement is true that North Korean weapons were on board, measures should be taken against the apparent violation of UN resolutions," it quoted an anonymous official at Seoul's Foreign Ministry as saying.

Democratic holdout agrees to support health care reform in US
The spotlight was on moderate Democratic Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who had been the last holdout as Senate Democrats raced against the clock and against determined Republican opposition to pass their health care bill by their self-imposed deadline of December 25th, Christmas. Nelson said he is now ready to vote for cloture, which would advance the bill. "Change is never easy, but change is what is necessary in American today and and that is why I intend to vote for cloture, I intend to vote for cloture and for health care reform," he said. Nelson said he decided to support the bill after winning new concessions from Democratic Senate Majority leader Harry Reid to limit the availability of abortions in insurance sold under the new legislation. The legislation would extend health benefits to more than 30 million uninsured Americans and impose new regulations on the health insurance industry. Senator Reid of Nevada has been working for months to win over one holdout Democratic senator after another, repeatedly altering the bill to satisfy different demands. When President Obama signs this bill into law, we will officially end the era in which insurance companies win only when patients lose," he said. Nelson's support should pave the way for Senate Democrats to win the first of a series of crucial procedural votes scheduled to begin at one o'clock in the morning (0600 GMT) Monday and set to conclude - if everything goes smoothly for them - with final passage on Christmas Eve. Republicans have been using a number of parliamentary procedures to delay action on the bill, including forcing a reading on the Senate floor Saturday of Reid's 338-pages of last minute amendments. "And Democrats are forcing a vote on it, as I indicated, over the weekend, counting on the fact that the American people are preoccupied with Christmas and not paying much attention to what they are doing," he said. Republicans are unified in their opposition, saying the bill is too expensive and will not solve the problems with the current health care system.

Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri dies
Students chanting pro-reform slogans filled university campuses following the death of the Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri from a heart attack at the age of 87. His grandson, Nasser Montazeri, said he had died in his sleep. Ayatollah Montazeri was originally a follower of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary, and was seen in the 1980s as his natural successor. But he came to oppose the dictatorial nature of the regime, particularly its mass executions of members of an opposition movement in the years before Ayatollah Khomeini's death, and ended up one of its fiercest critics. He spent five years in the late 1990s under house arrest, and even after his release he continued to oppose what he termed the regime's repression. Nevertheless, he remained in Qom, the holy city seen as the regime's birthplace, and supporters were converging on the city from all over the country to attend his funeral, due to take place today/Monday. "My grandfather died in his sleep last night," said Nasser Montazeri. "People and friends are coming to express their condolences but there are no special security measures around our house." Tagheer, the website of the reformist defeated election candidate Mehdi Karroubi said: "The social network of the reform movement has called on its supporters to gather in Mohseni Square (in Tehran) to mourn. Based on reports people have already gathered in some other squares in Tehran." By yesterday evening more security forces had been put on alert out of fear the funeral could become yet another focus for opposition rallies.

Two killed, 47 injured in coach crash in Cornwall, England
The first police car to arrive at the scene also crashed Two women have died and another 47 people have been injured in a coach crash on a country road in Cornwall. The coach rolled on to its side after skidding on sheet ice on an ungritted road in Townshend, near Hayle. The passengers were returning from a trip to see Christmas lights 14 miles away in Mousehole when the crash happened at 2215 GMT on Tuesday. The first police car at the scene also skidded and crashed into the coach, owned by local firm Williams Travel. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those passengers who sadly died, and also all the other passengers who were on the coach Garry Williams, Williams Travel Passengers say crash was 'horrific' Coach driver 'avoided bigger tragedy' Supt Tim Swarbrick said: "It's a tragedy at this time of the year and our thoughts are with the families of all those involved." He said: "The effective response from emergency services, combined with the local community's willingness to help, resulted in the delivery of high quality care to a large number of patients in very challenging circumstances." The other is believed to have died after being taken to hospital. The operations manager at Camborne-based Williams Travel, Garry Williams, said: "I attended Treliske Hospital to speak to the driver and a number of passengers, all of which said that the coach was unable to stop once it had come into contact with the black ice, and then turned over onto its side and ended up in a ditch. "Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those passengers who sadly died, and also all the other passengers who were on the coach."

U.S. Senate passes landmark health care reform bill
"The yeas are 60, the nays are 39. 3590 as amended, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is passed," Vice President Joe Biden announced. The vice president presided over the Senate at the time of the vote. As expected, Republicans voted against the bill while all Democrats and two Independents voted for it. At an estimated $87 billion, the measure would expand health insurance coverage to about 30 million more Americans currently without it, create new private insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, to expand choice. And, like the slightly more expensive measure passed by the House of Representatives, it would end a practice by private insurance companies of denying coverage to individuals with existing health problems. Both the Senate and House measures would require nearly all Americans to purchase some form of insurance, while lower-income Americans would receive help from federal government subsidies. In remarks before the vote, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said opponents had done everything they could to prevent the vote from taking place. Speaking to reporters, Reid and others hailed the vote as a victory and a major step toward providing millions more Americans with access to health care. "This is a victory because we have affirmed that the ability to live a healthy life in our great country is a right and not merely a privilege for the select few," Reid said. Reid and others paid tribute to to Senator Edward Kennedy, who died this past August after spending decades of his career in the Senate pursuing health care reform. In the final hours of debate on the Senate bill, Republicans asserted it would be ineffective and add sharply to the U.S. budget deficit. Jeff Sessions is a Republican from Alabama:  "This legislation may have a great vision, it may have a great idea about trying to make the system work better.

Failed bomb aboard Delta flight
The plane was carrying 278 passengers An incident on an airliner arriving in the US city of Detroit from Amsterdam in the Netherlands was a failed bomb attack, senior US officials say. Sources say a man burnt his leg trying to ignite explosives on the jet, which had 278 passengers and 11 crew aboard, but nobody else was seriously hurt. In custody, the Nigerian suspect said he had been acting on behalf of al-Qaeda, a police source said. President Barack Obama has ordered increased security for air travel. Northwest Airlines Flight 253 had been about 20 minutes away from landing at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Friday afternoon when the incident occurred. Reports quote officials as saying the suspect seems to have tried to ignite some kind of incendiary device. Melinda Dennis, a passenger, said the man had been severely burned on one leg, and a fire extinguisher and water were used to put out the fire.

Deaths in Philippines ferry accidents
Distraught relatives waited for news in Batangas City At least three people have died and 22 remain missing after a ferry sank in waters south of the Philippines capital, Manila, the coast guard says. The vessel was carrying 88 passengers and crew when it went down near Batangas City. Ships in the area rescued more than 60 people. Up to 24 people are still missing after that vessel and a fishing boat collided in darkness in Manila Bay. In the latest tragedy, survivors said the roll-on ferry listed and sank after taking in water from the bow ramp. There were dozens of people on the water crying for help and calling out the names of their family members Eric Musngi Survivor Philippine vessels collide at sea Three passing ships helped rescue teams pick up survivors from the MV Baleno-9 vessel, and the search was continuing on Sunday.

Nigerian man charged with trying to blow up airliner
At the same time, a jittery air travel system coped with a new scare. On the same flight that Mr. Abdulmutallab took on Friday — Northwest 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit — an ailing Nigerian man who spent a long time in the restroom inadvertently set off a security alert. It turned out to be a false alarm. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Officials in several countries, meanwhile, worked to retrace Mr. Abdulmutallab’s path and to look for security holes. In Nigeria, officials said he arrived in Lagos on Christmas Eve, just hours before departing for Amsterdam. Obama administration officials scrambled to portray the episode, in which passengers and flight attendants subdued Mr. Abdulmutallab and doused the fire he had started, as a test that the air safety system passed. “The system has worked really very, very smoothly over the course of the past several days,” Janet Napolitano, the Homeland Security secretary said, in an interview on “This Week” on ABC. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, the ranking minority member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said that his visa should have been revoked, or that he at least should have been given a physical pat-down or a full-body scan.

Elvish, Klingon and Na'vi: Constructed languages gain foothold in film
In the run-up to the release of his sci-fi blockbuster Avatar , James Cameron has been proclaiming the richness of the Na'vi language spoken by the film's jungle-planet aliens. As the director has said, he wanted to "out-Klingon Klingon." The Klingon language (or tlhIngan Hol as diehard Trekkies know it) not only raised the bar for Hollywood alien-speak, with its full grammar rules and relatively wide vocabulary. Developed by linguist Marc Okrand for the Star Trek films (beginning with Star Trek III ) and subsequent TV series, the guttural Klingon was based around many of the most uncommon grammar structures and consonant sounds of real-world languages, to make it sound all the more alien. The late UCLA linguist Victoria Fromkin is often credited for being one of the first to devise a full dialect for alien characters, with her language for the primates in the original Land of the Lost television series. Film and literature, though, brim with invented languages, from Nadsat in Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange to the Middle Earth languages of J.R.R. Clips with Avatar 's Na'vi language, developed by California professor Paul Frommer, seem to have the burr and open vowels of a kind of Latin-American Spanish patois, albeit by way of Africa.

Somali pirates capture two ships
The St James Park issued a distress call on Monday night saying it had been attacked by pirates Somali pirates have captured two ships with 45 crew off the East African coast, officials say. A UK-flagged chemical tanker, the St James Park, was reportedly captured in the Gulf of Aden on Monday while on its way to Thailand from Spain. Its 26 crew hail from Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Georgia, India, Turkey and the Philippines. The Navios Apollon, a Panamanian-flagged Greek cargo ship with 19 crew, was hijacked north of the Seychelles. The 50,000-tonne carrier - which had been sailing from the US state of Florida to India - was boarded on Monday by 10 men in speedboats, according to the Greek coastguard. Pirate attacks have been common off the Somali coast and international navies have been deployed to counter them. 'No contact' The St James Park issued a distress call on Monday night saying it had been attacked by pirates, said the International Maritime Bureau. The tanker, which was carrying a cargo of chemicals used to make plastics, had changed course and was now heading towards the northern coast of Somalia, said Andrew Mwangura of the Seafarers Assistance Programme. "It is expected to arrive there later this evening," Mr Mwangura told AFP news agency. The ship's owner-operators told the BBC they were working for "the early and safe release of our crew members on board".

Icelandic government passes Icesave deal; €12,000 debt per citizen
Icesave collapsed last October Iceland's parliament has approved plans to repay 3.8bn euros (£3.4bn) to savers in the UK and the Netherlands. The money will go to the British and Dutch governments, who partially compensated savers when the Icesave online bank failed. More than 320,000 savers lost out when the bank collapsed in 2008. A bill on the measure, narrowly approved against strong opposition, was seen as crucial to Iceland's bid to join the EU and rebuild its economy. The bill was passed by 33 votes to 30. The Icelandic government had threatened to resign if the measure was rejected. "Approving the bill is the better option and will avoid even more economic damage," Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson said during the debate. A poll taken in August suggests that 70% of Icelanders were against the Icesave deal. An original agreement - negotiated with the British and Dutch governments - was approved in August. Under the new deal the money - which represents 40% of the country's gross domestic product - will be repaid gradually, staggered until 2024. The claim follows a guarantee made by the bank in 2008 to fulfil sponsor Hamleys' obligation, after the toy shop's Icelandic owner, retail group Baugur failed to pay up. Baugur took on significant debt after a spending spree of British high street chains House of Fraser, Oasis and Karen Millen and though the Hamleys logo continued to feature on the Williams cars, Glitnir took over payments.

Afghanistan suicide bomb leaves seven Americans dead
Afghanistan suicide bombing kills 8 CIA officers The Taliban takes responsibility for the explosion at a U.S. base in Khowst province where the agency has a major presence. The statement, attributed to spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, said the attacker was a member of the Afghan army who entered the base clad in his military uniform. It identified him only as Samiullah. A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the CIA had a major presence at the base, in part because of its strategic location. The attack took place at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khowst province, an area near the border with Pakistan that is a hotbed of insurgent activity. An undisclosed number of civilians were wounded, the officials said. Reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Rochester, N.Y. -- A bomber slipped into a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday and detonated a suicide vest, killing eight CIA officers in one of the deadliest days in the agency's history, current and former U.S. officials said. The casualties highlight the CIA's increasingly important role in Afghanistan, and come as the United States is embarking on a major buildup of its civilian workforce that parallels an increase in troop strength. A former U.S. intelligence official knowledgeable about the bombing said it killed more CIA personnel than any attack since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983. Before Wednesday's attack, four CIA operatives had been killed in Afghanistan, the former official said.

Afghanistan's parliament rejects Karzai's cabinet nominations
Afghanistan's parliament dealt a blow to President Hamid Karzai Saturday, rejecting most of his nominees for a new Cabinet. It took parliament hours to count the yellow paper ballots cast secretly by more than 200 lawmakers. But after each of the nominees was deemed either "accepted" or "rejected," the verdict was clear. Parliament gave a vote of no confidence to 17 of the 24 Cabinet nominees picked by President Hamid Karzai. Among those rejected was Ismail Khan, a former warlord accused of ruling western Herat province like a tyrant. Mr. Karzai had hoped the power-broker would serve a second term as energy minister. The Cabinet's only female member also lost her job as Women's Affairs minister by just two votes. Forming the Cabinet is Mr. Karzai's first test of governance after he secured a second term in office in elections marred by rampant fraud last August. Despite the concerns, Cabinet experience appears to have helped incumbent Interior Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar.

US, UK embassies in Yemen close due to al-Qaeda threat
The United States and Britain closed their embassies in Yemen Sunday, pointing to ongoing terrorist threats. The closures come after the two nations pledged to boost counter-terrorism support to the Yemeni government. The U.S. embassy's website said the threats come from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the group linked to the failed Christmas Day airplane bombing attempt in the United States. The Nigerian suspect in the case told U.S. authorities he received training from al-Qaida affiliates in Yemen. The closures come a day after U.S. General David Petraeus visited the capital, Sana'a, to discuss security issues with President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The influential general, who oversees the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, recently announced that Washington would more than double its security aid to the impoverished nation. Britain has also announced plans to join with the United States in funding a counter-terrorism police unit in Yemen, as well as plans to hold an international conference on Yemeni security later this month. Editor Hakim Almasmari, of the Yemen Post newspaper, thinks the conference might be advantageous if it results in more development projects for rural Yemen. "Its followers are not more than 400 in all. The situation has gained new urgency as the government in Sana'a finds itself overwhelmed not only by the growing terrorist threat, but also two separate rebellions, one of which has become something of a proxy war, at least in rhetoric, between Iran and Saudi Arabia. U.S. military experts have warned that vast reaches of the impoverished nation, with its booming population and dwindling resources, could spin permanently out of the government's control.

Airport security tightened worldwide
Full-body scanners are to be introduced at Britain's airports after Gordon Brown gave the go-ahead for the technology in a move which pre-empted his own urgent review of airline security. Despite questions over the effectiveness of the devices, the prime minister said yesterday that passengers would see their "gradual" introduction, along with hand luggage checks for traces of explosives. Even those travelling through UK airports in transit would have to go through the heightened security screening. BAA, which runs six UK airports, said it would install the £100,000 machines "as soon as is practical" at Heathrow. Experts have cast doubt on whether the scanners are able to detect the type of explosive that 23-year-old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is accused of using in an attempt to blow up a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day. But Brown told BBC1's Andrew Marr show that the government would do everything in its power to tighten security. His backing of scanner technology came before Lord Adonis, the transport secretary, reports to parliament this week on the findings of an urgent review of airport security prompted by the failed attack. It also pre-empts a European commission meeting, to be held soon, on whether to endorse EU-wide use of the machines. Four scanners have lain unused at Heathrow airport after EU advice that there were privacy and human rights implications, awaiting approval for use from the European commission, but a government source told the Guardian that these would now be deployed "with or without" the international co-operation that ministers said was needed after the recent bomb bid. The source pointed to the decision by Amsterdam's Schiphol airport to install the 17 scanners it bought two years ago but was unable to activate after receiving EU advice that there were privacy and human rights implications. Alongside the purchase of more scanners, a government source has told the Guardian that passenger profiling is "in the mix" of the security review's recommendations.

Suicide bomber at US base in Afghanistan was al-Qaeda double agent
U.S. media say a suicide bomber who attacked a CIA base in eastern Afghanistan last week was a Jordanian working as an al-Qaida double agent. The reports say current and former Western intelligence officials identified the suicide bomber as Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, a 36-year-old al-Qaida sympathizer from Zarqa, Jordan. U.S. network NBC says Jordanian authorities arrested al-Balawi more than a year ago and later recruited him to infiltrate al-Qaida, believing he had been successfully reformed. The bombing last Wednesday at the CIA base in Afghanistan's Khost province killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian officer. The U.S. military's intelligence chief in Afghanistan has criticized the work of U.S. spy agencies operating there, saying they are "ignorant" and out of touch with the Afghan people. General Michael Flynn says U.S. intelligence efforts have focussed too much on gathering information about insurgent groups in Afghanistan. He says U.S. intelligence has been unable to inform U.S. and NATO forces about the environment in which they operate and the Afghan people whom they seek to persuade. His comments were published in a report issued Monday by a U.S. research institute, the Center for New American Security.

Japanese survivor of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings dies, aged 93
Mr Yamaguchi had the bad luck to be in Hiroshima and then Nagasaki The only person officially recognised as having survived both atomic bombings in Japan at the end of World War II has died from stomach cancer, aged 93. Tsutomu Yamaguchi was in Hiroshima on a business trip on 6 August 1945 when a US plane dropped the first atomic bomb. He suffered serious burns and spent a night there before returning to his home city of Nagasaki just before it was bombed on 9 August. He said he hoped his experience held a lesson of peace for future generations. It was already recorded that Mr Yamaguchi had survived the Nagasaki bomb, but in March last year officials recognised he had been in Hiroshima as well. 'Precious storyteller' A handful or Japanese people are known to have lived through both attacks, but Mr Yamaguchi is the only one formally recognised by the Japanese government to have done so. More than 200,000 people were killed in the two atomic bombings Certification as a hibakusha or radiation survivor qualifies Japanese citizens for government compensation, including medical check-ups, and funeral costs. On learning of his official recognition last year, Mr Yamaguchi said: "My double radiation exposure is now an official government record. In his later years, Mr Yamaguchi gave talks about his experiences as an atomic bomb survivor and emphasised his hope nuclear weapons would be abolished.

'Not guilty' plea from Abdulmutallab on Detroit jet bombing charges
Mr Abdulmutallab's court appearance lasted less than five minutes A "not guilty" plea has been entered on behalf of the Nigerian man accused of attempting to detonate a bomb on a Detroit-bound plane on Christmas Day. A Detroit judge took the action after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab declined to enter a plea during his first court appearance. Mr Abdulmutallab, 23, is charged with the attempted murder of 290 people and five other counts. He confirmed his name and its spelling, as well as his age in a soft voice, prompting the judge to ask him to speak up. The man who faces six charges, including attempting to blow up a plane and kill the 289 other passengers and crew on 253 to Detroit on Christmas Day, hobbled in perhaps because of the injuries sustained or the leg irons he was wearing. A short young man, he sat in a chair and for several moments listened and nodded to his lawyers. He looked up slowly, his eyes staring with a slightly vacant look at the court. Abdulmutallab impassive in court Asked if he had had time to read the indictment, he answered "yes". Mr Abdulmutallab was treated for burns after his arrest at Detroit airport after he allegedly tried to detonate a device concealed in his underwear on Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit.

Gordon Brown says the UK won't run out of gas
Supply for gas in the UK has reached record levels over the last week Gordon Brown has pledged the UK's gas supplies will not run out during the current cold snap, and that road salt will get to "where it is most needed". The PM acknowledged the "worrying and frustrating" situation but said agencies were working together to keep the public "safe and warm". Meanwhile, National Grid also has issued its third 'balancing alert' in a week, aimed at adjusting gas supplies. Police have confirmed two more weather-related deaths, taking the total to 26. The cold weather is set to continue for the next few days at least, with more snow forecast overnight in some parts of the UK. National Grid had already issued and lifted two "balancing alerts" warning of a potential shortfall in supplies. A spokeswoman said the third alert, which is due to end at 0600GMT on Sunday, was not due to the weather conditions but problems in the Norwegian gas fields. She said a shortfall of 35 million cubic metres (mcm) was predicted, out of the 441 mcm needed. The spokeswoman said the market had already responded and supplies had come in from other sources. Earlier Mr Brown said the distributor had confirmed it expected to meet demand. The prime minister added: "We've got plenty of gas in our own back yard - the North Sea - and we also have access to the large reserves in Norway and Netherlands via pipelines."

REUTERS/Jim Young WASHINGTON The Republican Party chief called on Senator Harry Reid on Sunday to step down as Senate majority leader over racial comments about President Barack Obama, while Democrats tried to put the issue behind them. Reid, a key figure in pushing Obama's agenda through Congress, apologized to the president on Saturday over remarks published in a new book calling Obama a "light-skinned" black man "with no Negro dialect unless he wanted to have one." Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said Reid should step aside as Senate majority leader, saying if a Republican made the same remarks Democrats would be "screaming for his head." "Oh yeah, there's a big double standard here," Steele, who is black, said on the NBC program "Meet the Press." "There is this standard where the Democrats feel that they can say these things and they can apologize when it ... comes from the mouths of their own. But if it comes from anyone else, it's racism," Steele added on "Fox News Sunday." Steele said Reid used "anachronistic language," adding, "It harkens back to the 1950s and 60s, and it confirms to me a mind-set that's out of step with where America is today." Asked if his own words were a racial slur, Steele said, "Well, if it is, I apologize for it.

Explosion in Afghanistan kills two
British officials say a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan has killed a veteran British war correspondent and a U.S. Marine. Britain's Defense Ministry says Rupert Hamer, the defense correspondent for the Sunday Mirror newspaper, was killed while accompanying Marines on patrol in Helmand province Saturday. Photographer Philip Coburn was seriously wounded by the makeshift bomb, as were four other Marines. Officials retracted earlier reports that an Afghan soldier was among those killed. Hamer is believed to be the first British journalist to be killed in the Afghan conflict. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has released a statement expressing sympathy for his family, friends and colleagues. Hamer is the second journalist killed in Afghanistan in as many weeks. Meanwhile, U.S. and Afghan authorities have signed a deal that is expected to transfer responsibility for the U.S.-run detention facility at Bagram Air Base by the end of the year. The site, near Kabul, has been used to hold detainees since the U.S.-led offensive in Afghanistan began in 2001. U.S. troops were accused of beating two prisoners to death at Bagram in 2002. Human rights groups have criticized the United States for detaining inmates for lengthy periods of time without charge.

Al-Qaida demands hostage exchange; threatens to kill if demands not met
BAMAKO, Mali, Jan. 11 (UPI) -- The North African wing of al-Qaida says it will kill a French hostage unless Mali releases four of its members within 20 days, authorities say. Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb is demanding the release in exchange for freeing Pierre Camatte, CNN reported Monday. "Let France and Mali be forewarned that we give 20 days to fulfill our just demand or the two governments shall be fully responsible for the life of the French hostage," the group said in a statement on an Islamic Web site. AQIM executed a British citizen in June after the British government refused to release Abu Qatada, believed to be Osama bin Laden's top deputy in Europe, CNN said. It joined forces with al-Qaida in 2004 and has spread its reach across North and West Africa, CNN reported. The al-Qaeda group says it seized Frenchman Pierre Camatte in Mali A branch of the al-Qaeda network is demanding the release of four of its members in exchange for a Frenchman it says it kidnapped in Mali last month. Four days later, three Spanish aid workers were snatched from an aid convoy in neighbouring Mauritania. The statement, issued on Sunday by the north African branch of al-Qaeda, sets an ultimatum of 20 days for the exchange, after which, it says, the French and Malian governments "will be fully responsible for the French hostage's life". Warning to visitors A Malian official has said the demand amounts to "blackmail". A source close to the negotiators told the AFP news agency that the group was also demanding a ransom to free Mr Camatte.

7.0 magnitude earthquake strikes off Haitian coast
The extent of the devastation is still unclear but there are fears thousands of people may have died. Haiti's worst quake in two centuries hit south of the capital Port-au-Prince on Tuesday, wrecking the presidential palace, UN HQ and other buildings. A "large number" of UN personnel were reported missing by the organisation. Many people have spent the night outside amid fears of more aftershocks. The Red Cross says up to three million people have been affected. Describing the earthquake as a "catastrophe", Haiti's envoy to the US said the cost of the damage could run into billions. A number of nations, including the US, UK and Venezuela, are gearing up to send aid. The quake, which struck about 15km (10 miles) south-west of Port-au-Prince, was quickly followed by two strong aftershocks of 5.9 and 5.5 magnitude. The tremor hit at 1653 (2153 GMT) on Tuesday, the US Geological Survey said. Phone lines to the country failed shortly afterwards.

Google may shut down Chinese operations due to censorship and cyber attacks
Those attacks, which Google said took place last week, were directed at some 34 companies or entities, most of them in Silicon Valley, California, according to people with knowledge of Google’s investigation into the matter. The attackers may have succeeded in penetrating elaborate computer security systems and obtaining crucial corporate data and software source codes, though Google said it did not itself suffer losses of that kind. Advertisement Continue reading the main story While the scope of the hacking and the motivations and identities of the hackers remained uncertain, Google’s response amounted to an unambiguous repudiation of its own five-year courtship of the vast China market, which most major multinational companies consider crucial to their growth prospects. It is also likely to enrage the Chinese authorities, who deny that they censor the Internet and are accustomed to having major foreign companies adapt their practices to Chinese norms. The company said it would try to negotiate a new arrangement to provide uncensored results on its search site, google.cn. But that is a highly unlikely prospect in a country that has the most sweeping Web filtering system in the world. Google said it would otherwise cease to run google.cn and would consider shutting its offices in China, where it employs some 700 people, many of them highly compensated software engineers, and has an estimated $300 million in annual revenue. Google executives declined to discuss in detail their reasons for overturning their China strategy. But despite a costly investment, the company has a much smaller share of the search market here than it does in other major markets, commanding only about one in three searches by Chinese.

The United Nations is gearing up for a huge operation to help hundreds of thousands of victims of the powerful earthquake that struck Haiti on Tuesday. U.N. and international agencies are sending disaster experts and essential relief supplies to the stricken Caribbean Island. The earthquake hit a number of areas including the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, where some four million people live. The World Food Program, which has a large staff on the ground, says the level of destruction indicates many of these people have been affected and will require help. The Director of the WFP office in Geneva, Charles Vincent, says the first priority is to save lives. "To rescue people that are buried, that are trapped, etc.…followed very rapidly by a big problem of water, sanitation, epidemic-problems of diseases that might be bred in that kind of situation," Vincent said. Vincent says shelter and food are also critical needs. He says WFP has extensive stocks of food in the country and will distribute supplies to the victims as soon as possible. He says WFP is also airlifting energy biscuits for 30,000 people. Describing the earthquake as a "catastrophe", Haiti's envoy to the U.S. said the cost of the damage could run into billions. The Inter-American Development Bank said it will immediately approve a $200,000 grant for emergency asssistance to Haiti which is aimed at providing food, water, medicine and shelter for earthquake victims. PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti—Cries from victims entombed beneath concrete debris pierced the air of seemingly every street in this crowded capital Wednesday, where shocked residents carried the injured and the dead a day after the nation was hit by a quake that some estimate has killed more than 100,000 people.

Countries around the world send aid, help to Haiti
The president pledged $100 million for the earthquake-stricken Caribbean country. President Obama says the first waves of U.S. rescue and relief workers are at work in Haiti. "Search and rescue teams are actively working to save lives," Mr. Obama said. "Our military has secured the airport, and prepared it to receive the heavy equipment and resources that are on the way, and to receive them around the clock, 24 hours a day. An airlift has been set up to deliver high-priority items like water and medicine." The president acknowledges it may take days to move the full U.S. relief effort into Haiti, because roads, airports, ports and communications were damaged in the quake. But he is seeking to reassure the Haitian people that an enormous humanitarian effort is on the way. "More American search and rescue teams are coming, more food, more water, doctors, nurses, paramedics, more of the people, equipment and capabilities that can make the difference between life and death," Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama is also committing the U.S. government to an immediate investment of $100 million for earthquake relief in Haiti. "This will mean more of the life-saving equipment, food, water and medicine that will be needed," Mr. Obama said. The State Department says it is aware of at least three possible American deaths, and says it is working to locate U.S. Embassy personnel and other U.S. citizens in Haiti.

Haiti relief efforts: in depth
The Haitian Red Cross says the earthquake killed between 45,000 and 50,000 [AFP/UN/Mintusah] Aid agencies are struggling to reach the up to three million of people affected by an earthquake that has devastated Haiti, levelling buildings and burying thousands of people in the rubble. At least 300,000 people were estimated to be homeless in Port-au-Prince on Friday, more than 48 hours after one in 10 homes in the capital collapsed, the United Nations said. Many more people were believed to be sleeping on the streets fearing aftershocks will cause more buildings to fall. 'Logistical challenge'  Rescue and aid efforts have been been hampered by blocked roads, severed communications lines and the difficulties faced by relief agencies that have lost personnel and seen their office destroyed. The capital's port was too badly damaged to handle cargo and supply planes arrived at the airport faster than ground crews could unload them, prompting aviation authorities to restrict non-military flights for fear jets would run out of fuel while waiting to land. Alejandro Lopez-Chicheri, senior spokesman for the World Food Programme for Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean, said that Haiti was "completely on the ground". "The roads, many of them are still to be opened, and on the ones that are open there are still people concentrated on the sides of the roads," he told Al Jazeera from Port-au-Prince. Before the earthquake struck we were already assisting one million people here, we are considering it will be at least double that after this earthquake." "A lot of people have simply grown tired of waiting for those emergency workers to get to them," Al Jazeera's Sebastian Walker said. David Wimhurst, spokesman for the Brazilian-commanded UN peacekeeping force, said: "Unfortunately, they're slowly getting more angry and impatient. "I fear, we are all aware that the situation is getting more tense as the poorest people who need so much, are waiting for deliveries.

US drone strike kills at least fifteen in Pakistan
US drone attacks are being stepped up along the Afghan-Pakistan border A missile attack by a US drone aircraft has killed at least 15 people in north-west Pakistan, officials say. Four missiles hit the house of a local tribesman in Shaktoi, South Waziristan, near the Afghan border, an official told the BBC. The official said all those killed in the attack were militants. Last week an attack in the same area reportedly targeted Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, but the Taliban say he survived. "Now the death toll is 15. People are still busy removing rubble," a senior security official told Reuters. Most of the casualties were foreign fighters, he added. Another report said the house was being used by Uzbek militants fighting with the Taliban. The US has stepped up drone attacks in north-west Pakistan since a suicide bomber killed seven CIA agents across the border in Afghanistan last month. Saturday, Pakistani Taliban militants issued a new audio recording they said proved their leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, survived a suspected U.S. missile strike last week.

Ukraine presidential election headed for runoff
The Orange Revolution did not bring the benefits many Ukrainians hoped for Ukraine's presidential election is set for a second round run-off after partial results showed no candidate would win more than 50% of the vote. With half the votes counted, former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych led current PM Yulia Tymoshenko by 37% to 24%. The two were on opposing sides of the Orange Revolution in 2004-5, but both now favour closer ties with Russia. ANALYSIS Gabriel Gatehouse, BBC News, Kiev Unless the exit polls are very wide of the mark, Viktor Yanukovych will face the Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, in a second round run-off on 7 February. She was instrumental in bringing the current President, Viktor Yushchenko to power during the Orange Revolution five years ago. But the pair soon fell out, and she is now portraying herself as the heir of the Orange mantle. Five years ago Viktor Yanukovych was the villain, tainted by allegations of vote-rigging and open support from Moscow. Now, both candidates say they favour closer ties with Russia - after five years of increasingly tense relations under President Yushchenko - and the Kremlin seems happy with either. The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse, in Kiev, says there is much disillusionment among voters over the failure to tackle corruption and links with the EU. Turnout in the election was reported to be less than 50% by early afternoon.

Scott Brown wins special election for Massachusetts's Senate seat in upset victory
Toward the end of her speech, her voice cracked as she quoted Kennedy, saying, “The work begins anew, the hope rises again, and the dream lives on.’’ “I am heartbroken at the result,’’ Coakley told disappointed supporters at the Sheraton Boston. “But I know that we will get up together tomorrow and continue this fight, even with this result tonight.’’ Coakley fared best in liberal suburbs immediately west of Boston, the Berkshires, and in cities such as Lawrence, Springfield, and New Bedford, though not by the large margins required to win statewide. Brown’s strength came from the North and South shores, as well as the suburbs in the Interstate 495 belt, including Holliston, Ashland, and Marlborough, where successful Republicans have historically fared well. He ran up big margins in Plymouth and surrounding communities, as well as in Worcester County. “I go to Washington as the representative of no faction or no special interest, answering only to my conscience and to you the people,’’ Brown said. “I know I have a lot to learn in the Senate, but I know who I am, and I know who I serve. And I drive a truck.’’ And while Brown paid homage to Kennedy, saying “his name would always command respect,’’ he spoke against the health care bill as the crowd chanted “Forty-one! Forty-one!’’ In a race that became the focus of national attention, Brown’s win was widely seen as a vote against the president’s agenda from one of the most reliably Democratic states. Coakley called Brown to concede a little more than an hour after polls closed, and the Brown campaign party erupted into jubilant cheers soon after. The stunning, come-from-behind victory caps a dramatic surge in recent days as Brown, a state lawmaker from Wrentham once thought to have little chance of beating a popular attorney general, roared ahead of Coakley to become the first Republican senator elected from Massachusetts since 1972. Republican Scott P. Brown pulled off one of the biggest upsets in Massachusetts political history last night, defeating Democrat Martha Coakley to become the state’s next US senator and potentially derailing President Obama’s hopes for a health care overhaul. President Obama called both candidates last night, congratulating Brown on a well-run campaign’’ and telling Coakley “we can’t win them all.’’ Coakley, after cruising to an easy victory in the primary, began the general election race with seemingly every edge, from name recognition and fund-raising ability to a lopsided advantage in voter registration and the backing of the state’s Democratic establishment.

UK woman convicted of 'mercy' murder of son
Frances Inglis, 57, was given a life sentence for killing her 22-year-old son Tom after he sustained severe head injuries when he fell out of a moving ambulance. Tom's brother, Alex, speaking outside court, praised his mother for her "loving and courageous act" and called for a review of the law for people who kill as an "act of mercy". He said: "How can it be legal to withhold food and water, which means a slow and painful death, yet illegal to end all suffering in a quick, calm and loving way? "What this case and a number of others have exposed is a need for a complete rethink of existing laws in regard to people that have been, and will be, in the same position as Tom." He said: "All of those who loved and were close to Tom have never seen this as murder. "Why is my mum the only person who has been called to answer for her actions which were done out of love for her son?" Inglis, who will serve at least nine years of her life sentence less the 423 days she has spent in custody, said she killed her son to end his "living hell" and that she had "no choice". The court heard how the mother gave her son a heroin overdose two months after he fell out of the moving ambulance in which he was being treated following a pub fight. Nurses resuscitated him and she was charged with attempted murder, but bailed on the condition she did not contact her son. A year later, she entered his nursing home posing as his aunt, and barricaded herself in his room using an oxygen cylinder, a wheelchair and superglue to seal the door shut. When staff broke down the door half an hour later, she urged them not to try to resuscitate him. Judge Brian Barker, the Common Serjeant of London, told the jury that they "could not have had a more difficult case", but asked them to put emotion aside and told them no one had the "unfettered right" to take the law into their own hands.

Bomb explosions kill several people in central Baghdad

REUTERS /Mohammed Ameen Damaged vehicles are seen at the site of a bomb attack in central Baghdad January 25, 2010. REUTERS/Saad Shalash BAGHDAD Three large car bombs rocked well-known Baghdad hotels on Monday, killing at least 36 people and ending a 1-1/2-month lull in coordinated assaults on the Iraqi capital as the country heads into a March election. Police said at least 71 people were wounded in the separate suicide car bombings, which went off within minutes of one another. Health Ministry data showed a lower figure for the death toll. The first blast occurred near an entrance of the Ishtar Sheraton hotel, a Baghdad landmark on the eastern side of the Tigris River. The shock wave blew open doors, shattered windows and sent thick dust swirling into the Reuters offices nearby. A giant mushroom cloud of debris rose from the blast site as ambulances and fire trucks rushed to the scene. The blast took place across from a park frequented by families and picnickers. The building has not been a regular hotel for years and largely houses company offices and some media organizations, but some adventurous international tour groups began using it last year. Zina Tareq, an Iraqi journalist who was in her office at the time of the blast, said she dived under a desk with the five-year-old daughter of a colleague.

Unreported tainted milk incident publicised in China
BEIJING Authorities in southwestern China have ordered three batches of milk products off shelves because they contain a chemical that killed at least six children in 2008, causing global concern over the made-in-China brand. The health department in Guizhou province stopped the sales of dairy products made by three Chinese companies, the state-run China Daily newspaper said. The products were found to contain melamine, which can cause kidney stones and is meant for making plastics, fertilizers and even concrete. Its high nitrogen content allows protein levels to appear higher when it is added to milk or animal feed. China executed two people in November for their role in a huge melamine-tainted milk scandal that killed at least six children and sullied the made-in-China brand. SHANGHAI—Chinese state-run media said the industrial chemical melamine was found again in milk products early last year, the latest report to suggest the government's crackdown on potentially dangerous practices in the dairy industry after a major 2008 food-safety scandal didn't fully solve the problem. Milk products made by three companies, Shandong Zibo Lusaier Dairy Co., Liaoning Tieling Wuzhou Food Co. and Laoting Kaida Refrigeration Plant, were found to have included excessive melamine and removed from store shelves... Products made by three different firms were found to contain melamine and have now been removed from supermarkets in Guizhou province, officials say. Melamine can be added to watered-down milk to make it appear to have a higher protein content. If ingested in sufficient quantities, melamine can cause kidney failure and kidney stones.

UK bans export of fraudulent bomb detector; arrests director of manufacturer
The ADE-651 is still in use at checkpoints in Baghdad Some Iraqi officials are insisting that a controversial bomb detection device works, despite a BBC inquiry in which experts said the item was useless. Britain has banned exports of the ADE-651 and the director of the company selling them was arrested and bailed. But the device is still being used at checkpoints all over Baghdad. Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani, whose department bought $85m of the devices, said the ADE-651 had detected 16,000 bombs, including 700 car bombs. "The thing is, the instrument is being operated by a user," he said. "Not all those who use the instrument are fully trained, the user needs to be alert and adept at using it." There are allegations that failure of the ADE-651 may have been a factor allowing suicide truck bombs to pass through checkpoints on three occasions last year, leading to hundreds of deaths. Iraqi investigations Jim McCormick, director of Somerset-based ATSC, which sold the device, says it uses special electronic cards slotted into it to detect explosives. We conducted several tests on them, and found them successful General Jihad al-Jabiri Interior ministry But a BBC Newsnight investigation reported that a computer laboratory said the card it examined contained only a tag used by shops to prevent theft. One has been ordered by Prime Minister Nouri Maliki, whose office has been told not to comment until the results are known. The Security and Defence Committee of the Iraqi parliament is also looking into the affair, and it will be discussed in the full chamber. Jawad al-Bolani said on Friday: "There are a lot of companies working on the development of these sort of instruments and Iraq is now considered a market area for companies producing such devices.

Votes in Sri Lankan presidential elections counted
There was controversy after Gen Fonseka was unable to vote Votes are being counted in Sri Lanka's first presidential election since Tamil Tiger rebels were defeated after more than 25 years of civil war. Election day passed largely peacefully despite several minor bomb blasts. President Mahinda Rajapaksa faces a close contest against his bitter rival, former army chief Gen Sarath Fonseka. The former allies fell out after the war ended last year. In the hours after the polls closed, soldiers established a heavy presence outside the hotel in central Colombo where Gen Fonseka is staying. The BBC's Charles Haviland, in the capital, says that about 50 armed troops are stationed outside the Cinnamon Lakeside hotel, searching every vehicle that enters. Gen Fonseka says he fears the troops plan to arrest him if he wins the election. A military spokesman has denied these claims. BBC correspondents say with the ethnic Sinhalese vote split between the two men, Tamil and Muslim minorities could play a decisive part in the outcome. Under Sri Lanka's electoral rules, if no candidate wins 50% of ballots cast in the first count, then voters' second - or even third - preferences are tallied to determine the winner.

Obama's first State of the Union speech focuses on economy, jobs
U.S. President Barack Obama is urging Americans to overcome a deficit of trust in government and work together to solve a damaged economy and other problems. The economy was high on the president's list of priorities in his annual State of the Union address Wednesday night. Mr. Obama acknowledged that many Americans are frustrated and angry, doubting whether he can deliver the change he promised in his 2008 campaign. But he said change is not easy, and he will continue to pursue it. "We do not quit. Let us seize this moment-to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more," he said. In his hour-long speech before both houses of Congress, the president several times confronted the public anger that has caused his approval ratings to slide. "We have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust-deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years," he said. Mr. Obama called for a number of initiatives to address the problem and urged the Senate to join the House of Representatives in passing a second jobs bill.

Historian Howard Zinn dies at age 87
BOSTON Historian and activist Howard Zinn, whose 1980 book "A People's History of the United States" was a rallying cry for the American left in a conservative era, has died aged 87. Family members said Zinn, who for decades was a fixture in the U.S. civil rights and anti-war movements and lived in Auburndale, Massachusetts, died of a heart attack on Wednesday while traveling in California. He was a professor emeritus in the political science department at Boston University and taught there from 1964 to 1988. "He had a deep sense of fairness and justice for the underdog. Rivers and Zinn were among a group of faculty members who in 1979 defended the right of the school's clerical workers to strike and were threatened with dismissal after refusing to cross a picket line. "A People's History of the United States" chronicled the nation's development through voices of women, minorities and the working class, telling the U.S. story as series of episodes where the state and big business colluded to crush socialism. American leftists celebrated the work at a time when conservatism as embodied by U.S. President Ronald Reagan was ascendant. Zinn was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1922 into a Jewish immigrant family. During World War Two he enlisted in the U.S. Army and flew in planes that bombed targets in Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. He wrote in the magazine "The Progressive" in 2006 that his military service had informed his anti-war views. "Once we decided, at the start, that our side was the good side and the other side was evil ... we did not have to think any more.

Two Iranians hanged over mosque bombing
Nasrin Sotoudeh, a lawyer for Rahmanipour, denied he had played any role in the unrest The executions were the first carried out for election-related incidents. 'Show trial' Iranian authorities arrested around 4,000 protesters including journalists and reformist politicians in a massive crackdown in the weeks after the disputed election. The two were among 11 people sentenced to death on similar charges in the wake of post-election protests. "He was arrested in Farvardin [the Iranian month covering March-April] before the [presidential] election and charged with co-operation with the [monarchist] Kingdom Assembly," Sotoudeh told AFP. She also said she was prevented from representing Rahmanipour at his "show trial" in July and that many of the charges were brought against him when he was a minor. "He confessed because of threats against his family," she said, adding that she was shocked at the news of the executions since she and her client's family had still been waiting for word from the appeals court. Crackdown Baqer Moin, an Iranian author and journalist, said the execution was a "political decision", likely intended to "set an example and to frighten some of the people who may shout a slogans that are not of the liking of the authorities". "We don't really know which group they belong to, one of them is a monarchist and the other one is the Mujahideen group, obviously the Mujahideen group is not very popular but little is known about the monarchist group," he told Al Jazeera. "Their lawyers have said that these people were arrested much before the elections, I suppose that they have been used as an example specifically as we are approaching the anniversary of the revolution." He said: "It is an attempt to make sure that the radicals within the opposition movements are not going to take the lead in the anniversary of the revolution." Denying fraud, Tehran portrayed the protests as a foreign-backed bid to undermine Iran's Islamic system of government.

Tony Blair tells Iraq Inquiry he would invade again
Tony Blair has said the Iraq war made the world a safer place and he has "no regrets" about removing Saddam Hussein. In a robust defence of his decision to back war, Mr Blair said Saddam was a "monster and I believe he threatened not just the region but the world." The former prime minister was barracked by a member of the public as he made his closing statement at the end of a six-hour grilling at the Iraq inquiry. 'Safer place' Family members of service personnel killed in Iraq - and members of the public who got their seats after a public ballot - had been sitting behind Mr Blair in the public gallery as he was questioned about the build-up and aftermath of the Iraq war. KEY POINTS 9/11 changed attitude to Iraq and meant tougher line was needed Denied "covert" deal at Crawford summit with President Bush in April 2002 over invasion Stood by "beyond doubt" claim over Iraq's chemical weapons Basis for war was Iraqi breach of UN disarmament agreements not regime change Should have corrected media reporting of 45-minute WMD claim Second UN resolution preferable but not legally necessary US offered "way out" option if UK could not provide troops Key issues: Blair's response Analysis: Questions remain Send us your comments When Mr Blair left he was booed by some members of the public and two women shouted at him "you are a liar" and "you are a murderer". Committee chairman Sir John Chilcot asked Mr Blair at the end of the session if he had any regrets about the war, but Mr Blair said that although he was "sorry" it had been "divisive" he believed it had been right to remove Saddam. "It was better to deal with this threat, to remove him from office and I do genuinely believe the world is a safer place as a result." He told the inquiry if Saddam had not been removed "today we would have a situation where Iraq was competing with Iran" both in terms of nuclear capability and "in respect of support of terrorist groups". "The decision I took - and frankly would take again - was if there was any possibility that he could develop weapons of mass destruction we should stop him." 'Covert deal' Sometimes it is important not to ask the "March 2003 question" but the "2010 question", said Mr Blair, arguing that if Saddam had been left in power the UK and its allies would have "lost our nerve" to act. Anti-war protesters were out in force near the Chilcot inquiry building He also stressed the importance of taking a "tough line" with Iran, accusing the country of colluding with al-Qeada to destabilise Iraq in the aftermath of the invasion, rejecting claims the UK had taken a "cavalier" attitude to post-war planning. Earlier witnesses to the inquiry have suggested he told Mr Bush at their April 2002 meeting at the ranch in Crawford, Texas, that the UK would join the Americans in a war with Iraq.

Ben Bernanke confirmed as Federal Reserve chairman for second term
WASHINGTON  The Senate gave Ben S. Bernanke a second four-year term as the head of the Federal Reserve on Thursday after critics excoriated the central bank’s conduct in the years leading up to the financial crisis. The 70-to-30 vote was the weakest endorsement ever extended to a chairman in the Fed’s 96-year history. The confirmation was a victory for President Obama, who had called Mr. Bernanke an architect of the recovery, but also signaled the extent to which the Fed, once little known to the public, has become the object of outrage over high unemployment and bank bailouts. In several hours of debate, senators said that the Fed had abetted, then ignored, the housing and credit bubbles and allowed banks to keep dangerously low capital reserves and to make reckless lending decisions that ruined consumers. Some even blamed Mr. Bernanke for the falling dollar and questioned his commitment to free enterprise. They reiterated that the Fed had made mistakes but said that Mr. Bernanke had helped save the economy from a far worse recession. After a week in which top White House officials and Mr. Bernanke met with Democratic leaders in the Senate to secure support, the Senate first voted 77 to 23 to end debate, with more than the 60 votes needed to overcome the threat of a filibuster. On a second vote, to confirm, the 30 dissents came from 18 Republicans, 11 Democrats and one independent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont. “As the nation continues to face the consequences of the worst recession in a generation, Ben Bernanke has provided wisdom and steady leadership in the midst of the financial and economic crisis,” he said. The Obama administration has proposed consolidating risk regulation under the Fed, while some in Congress want to strip away its oversight authority. “The institutional prestige of the Fed, even apart from this vote, had taken a hit, and it started back around the disaster of September 2008,” said Stephen H. Axilrod, who worked at the Fed for 34 years and wrote a history of its monetary policies.

US nationals arrested for alleged abduction of Haitian children
This weekend's arrest of 10 members of an Idaho-based Baptist charity for trying to take 33 Haitian children across the border with the Dominican Republic without proper paperwork has become an international incident. Clint Henry, head pastor at Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho, paused for a moment while taking questions from the media on Sunday. That question seems to be the last thing that Haiti's notoriously ill-equipped, underfunded, and understaffed government needs to be tackling in the wake of the Jan. 12 earthquake that leveled the capital, Port-au-Prince. But Saturday's arrest of 10 members of an Idaho-based Baptist charity for trying to take 33 Haitian children across the border with the Dominican Republic without proper paperwork has become an international incident. And it now threatens to be a serious distraction from the daunting task of providing food, shelter, and security for the more than 1 million left homeless by the quake. The members of the New Life Children's Refuge said that they were only trying to provide a better life for the children and denied that the group had done anything wrong. But the problem with following their highest sense of right without proper permission from the authorities is that it may technically be child trafficking. And in a weak country where that illicit trade has exploded in recent years, the authorities are taking this quite seriously. Prime Minister Max Bellerive denounced the group’s “illegal trafficking of children.” "This is an abduction, not an adoption," said Social Affairs Minister Yves Christallin, explaining that children need authorization from the ministry to leave the country. Apparently, the New Life members had no government-issued paperwork of any kind as they attempted to take the children across the border.

Obama announces US$3.8 trillion 2011 budget plan for US
US President Barack Obama has announced a $3.8tn (£2.4tn) budget plan for 2011, which includes increased spending for job creation, but cuts in other areas. He also forecast the US deficit would rise to a record $1.56tn this year. He scrapped plans to send astronauts back to the Moon and will seek to save $250bn by capping a range of domestic spending programmes for three years. Congress must approve the budget for the financial year starting on 1 October for it to take effect. Mr Obama blamed the huge deficit on the decisions of President George W Bush, previous Congresses and his administration's moves to prevent an economic collapse. ANALYSIS Kevin Connolly, BBC News, Washington Barack Obama, buffeted by recent election defeats for his Democratic Party, has a keen political sense of the image he wants to portray on the economy - that of a president forced by circumstance into enlarging America's already huge budget deficit in the short-term while promising in the medium-term to reduce it. So his $3.8tn budget includes more money for education and scientific research and more for defence programmes. But it also looks forward to eliminating waste and freezing many other domestic programmes. His electoral future may well depend on his ability to bring the deficit under control. He said that in normal circumstances he would have worked to cut the deficit immediately, but expensive steps were need to help the economy. He added: "We cannot continue to spend as if deficits do not matter."

NTSB says pilot error caused crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407
Mistakes by pilots, not bad weather, caused the crash of a turboprop plane near Buffalo last year that killed 50 people, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday in its final hearing on the crash. Among the errors: The plane's captain repeatedly yanked back on the control wheel when he should have pushed forward; the first officer miscalculated air speed and both were so distracted by a personal conversation that they were caught off guard in the minutes before the accident. Deborah Hersman, chairman of the safety board, said the investigation revealed a "picture of complacency and confusion that resulted in catastrophe." The safety board, the principal investigator of air accidents, adopted 46 recommendations related to the crash, in which a Colgan Air turboprop flying as Continental Connection Flight 3407 crashed during its approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The Feb. 12 crash killed all 49 people on board and one man in a house, making it the deadliest U.S. transportation accident in seven years. At the hearing, agency investigators portrayed the accident as almost completely avoidable. Investigators found that the plane -- a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 -- had no mechanical problems. Agency investigators also ruled out weather conditions, finding that the amount of ice accumulation on the plane did not alter its flight performance. Additionally, the board announced that it planned to hold a public symposium on code-sharing agreements between airlines. Hersman said the board would examine government oversight and financial aspects of such relationships. Half of all scheduled flights in the United States are operated by regional airlines, which have a poor safety record when compared with major carriers.

Pakistan arrests 35 people suspected in US soldiers' death
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Pakistani officials said Thursday that they have arrested 35 suspects as part of their investigation into a bombing that killed three American soldiers and four Pakistanis on Wednesday in northwest Pakistan. “They are all locals,” said the duty officer at the police station in the town of Balambat, where the bombing occurred, in the Lower Dir District. The police made 30 arrests, and 5 more were made by members of the paramilitary Frontier Corps, according to a senior official in the North-West Frontier Province. “We are questioning them in an effort to trace those who orchestrated the suicide attack,” a police official, Naeem Khan, told The Associated Press. ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani police have arrested 30 suspects in connection with a bombing that killed three American soldiers, three children and a Pakistani paramilitary soldier outside a girls' school, an officer said. Naeem Khan, duty officer in the police station in the town of Timergara in the northwest where the attack took place, said police suspect the Wednesday bombing was a suicide attack. "We have recovered the engine of the car we suspect was used in the bombing," Khan told Reuters. Forty-five people were wounded in the blast near the Swat Valley, where the government mounted a crackdown nearly a year ago it said had largely cleared out Taliban militants. We have sent these limbs for DNA tests," Khan said. Pakistan's Taliban have bombed markets, schools and military and police facilities despite major government security offensives that have destroyed some of their bases and U.S. drone aircraft strikes that have killed their leaders. Pakistani officials say they have arrested 35 people in connection with the suicide car bombing Tuesday that killed three American military trainers and four Pakistanis in northwest Pakistan.

Landmark coalition offensive launched in Afghanistan
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Afghan officials say Islamic State militants have attacked the Taliban in the northern Jawzjan province, igniting heavy clashes in which dozens of fighters were killed. Mohammad Reza Ghafori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said Wednesday that the fighting, which began the day before, has killed 76 Taliban fighters and 15 from the IS affiliate. He says the IS militants seized two districts from the Taliban. The Taliban and IS are both fighting to overthrow Afghanistan's U.S.-backed government and impose a harsh version of Islamic rule, but they are bitterly split over leadership and tactics. The IS affiliate is largely made up of disgruntled former Taliban fighters. Abdul Hafiz Khashyee, a police official, says the fighting took place in a remote area and there were no reports of civilian casualties. HELMAND PROVINCE, Afghanistan –NATO troops in Afghanistan launched their biggest offensive of the war early Saturday, attacking what they call the last Taliban stronghold in a war-scarred southern province. ET Friday) two firefights had erupted between the Taliban and U.S. Marines in Marjah. The offensive turned a main bazaar near the city center into a ghost town after residents were warned to leave the area. NATO forces said they are following a directive not to shoot at civilians, some of whom are still on the streets. "Insurgents who do not accept the government's offer to reintegrate and join the political process will be met with overwhelming force," the International Security Assistance Force Joint Command said in a statement.

Joint US-Pakistan operation captures top Taliban commander
U.S. officials say American and Pakistani intelligence forces together captured the Afghan Taliban's top military commander several days ago in Pakistan. Officials say the commander, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, is the most significant Taliban figure detained since the war in Afghanistan started eight years ago. The New York Times first reported news of the arrest late Monday. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is the Afghan Taliban's most influential member after the group's spiritual leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. Media reports quote U.S. officials as saying a secret joint operation between the United States and Pakistan captured the Taliban leader in Karachi. Officials say Baradar is in Pakistani custody, with American and Pakistani authorities taking part in interrogations. Taliban representatives denied Baradar had been arrested, but they did not provide any evidence to support their claim. But he said that since the U.S.-led coalition invaded the Taliban stronghold of Marjah in southern Afghanistan several days ago, Pakistan has arrested suspected militants who have fled across the border. "There are a number of arrests of people who were running away from Afghanistan and coming to Pakistan. The day we get any information [of] who are they, we will tell the people of Pakistan," said Malik. He also said that it is true the United States and Pakistan share intelligence information. But he stressed that Pakistan is a sovereign nation and does not allow foreign forces to take part in anti-militancy raids within its borders. The director of the Islamabad-based Institute of Regional Studies, Jamshed Ayaz, tells VOA news of Baradar's arrest coupled with an increase in pressure from the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan could put the Afghan government in a stronger position to bring the Taliban to reconciliation talks.

Plane crashes into office block in Austin, Texas
(CNN) -- The remains of two people have been found in an Austin, Texas, building where a man crashed a small plane, authorities said. The identities of the two dead people have not been confirmed, the Austin Fire Department said in a statement. Two other people who were injured in the incident were taken to a hospital, and 11 others were treated for minor injuries, Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said. Authorities said Andrew Joseph Stack III, 53, an Austin resident with an apparent grudge against the Internal Revenue Service, set his house on fire Thursday and then crashed a Piper Cherokee PA-28 into the building, which houses an IRS office with nearly 200 employees, federal officials said. "This appears to be an intentional act by a sole individual," Acevedo said at a news conference. A fire created by the crash had been put out, save for some small areas, officials said. Pilot: 'I have just had enough' Clues about what led to Thursday incident were few, but attention was directed at a message on a Web site registered to Stack appears to be a suicide note. "If you're reading this, you're no doubt asking yourself, 'Why did this have to happen?' "The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time." See text of the note (PDF) The building into which the airplane crashed is a federal IRS center with 199 employees. "I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different," the online message says.

Niger coup ousts president
(CNN) -- Niger's constitution has been suspended, a Niger military official announced Thursday night on the nation's three television channels. The order, read by Col. Goukoye Abdul Karimou, was attributed to the Superior Council for the Restoration of Democracy, which also suspended all institutions and called on the nation for calm and on the international community for support, said Ousman Tudou, a journalist for Radio Afini. No curfew had been ordered and people were in the streets at 11 p.m., around the time of the announcement, he said. Dana Palade, a spokeswoman for the nongovernmental organization World Vision, told CNN from the capital city of Niamey that the official made the announcement on Doumial Tele Sahel and RTT.

Madeira storm kills at least 42
Advertisement Rescue workers are searching mud-filled streets and houses on the Portuguese island of Madeira after flash floods left at least 42 people dead. More than 120 others were injured and an unknown number are missing, raising fears that the death toll could rise. Heavy rains brought tonnes of mud and stones down the slopes of the island, flooding the streets of the regional capital, Funchal, and other towns. Water, power and telecommunications were cut in some areas. In pictures: Flood aftermath Briton dies in Madeira floods Your pictures The weather improved on Sunday following Saturday's rains, making it easier for rescue workers. But regional social services spokesman Francisco Ramos said there were "great difficulties" in communications and that the death toll "will likely increase, given the circumstances of this flood". Three remote areas in the south of the island have been cut off. Officials fear more bodies may be found there. The Portuguese cabinet is due to discuss the crisis in an extraordinary meeting on Monday, and expected to announce three days of national mourning. Prime Minister Jose Socrates, who is on the island, said he was "profoundly shocked" by the severity of the floods, and promised that his government would help Madeira recover as quickly as possible. The military has sent specialist rescue and medical teams to the island.

Dutch government collapses over Afghanistan troops
Dutch forces have been in Uruzgan since 2006 The Dutch government has collapsed over disagreements within the governing coalition on extending troop deployments in Afghanistan. He offered his government's resignation to Queen Beatrix in a telephone call. The premier had been considering a Nato request for Dutch forces to stay in Afghanistan beyond August 2010. But Labour, the second-largest coalition party, has opposed the move. Asadullah Hamdam, the governor of the Afghan province of Uruzgan, where the Dutch mission is based, told the BBC that peace and reconstruction efforts would suffer a setback if the Dutch troops left. "They help our security forces a great deal in security matters here," said Mr Hamdam told the BBC. "In many districts they work together with the Afghan National Army, and they help in developmental projects. "They are constructing bridges, schools, roads and assisting in many other educational projects." Alliance spokesman James Appathurai said whatever happened, the Afghan people should know that Nato would "continue to provide support to them as long as necessary". 2010 commitment Just under 2,000 Dutch service personnel have been serving in the southern Afghan province of Uruzgan since 2006, with 21 killed.

General Petraeus: Fight for Afghan town Marja is 'just the initial operation'
The U.S. general who oversees the war in Afghanistan says the fight for the southern town of Marjah is just the first operation in a long campaign. Petraeus says the battle of Marjah is just the beginning. "This is just the initial operation of what will be a 12- to 18-month campaign, as General McChrystal and his team have mapped it out," he said. During an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Petraeus said the enemy is formidable. He did not predict how long the operation in Marjah - a traditional Taliban stronghold - would continue. He said only that the fighting is tough. "When we go on the offensive, when we take away sanctuaries and safe havens from the Taliban and the other extremist elements that we and our Afghan and coalition partners are fighting in that country, they are going to fight back. Look, I have repeatedly said these types of efforts are hard and they are hard all the time.

Toyota accused of misleading public over recalls
Toyota: Saved $100 million dodging recall Internal Toyota documents provided to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee show the carmaker saved $100 million by negotiating an 'equipment' recall' rather than a vehicle recall. NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- In an internal presentation, Toyota staffers boasted of the company saving $100 million by negotiating a limited recall for Toyota Camry and Lexus ES cars over a problem that could cause unintended acceleration. In an internal Toyota (TM) document used as part of a company presentation on its government relations, dated July 6, 2009, the phrase "Negotiated 'equipment' recall on Camry/ES re: [sudden acceleration], saved $100 million+ with no defect found" is among a bullet-pointed list of "wins." An "equipment" recall is a more limited type of recall, often to repair an accessory or non-essential part of the vehicle. The reference was apparently to a September 2007 recall to secure floor mats that could trap the cars' gas pedals. In August 2009, the month following the presentation in which the executive boasted of saving $100 million over a full recall, a family of four was killed in a Lexus with its gas pedal stuck under a floor mat. In November 2009, Toyota had full recall to reconfigure the gas pedals of numerous Toyota models to prevent such incidents. Toyota documents, presented in the form of a corporate slide show, also presented an unfavorable view of the Obama administration. The Toyota documents also said that NHTSA's "new, more aggressive management includes more attorneys," but "less understanding of engineering issues." Also, the documents said that equipment manufacturers face "a more challenging regulatory and enforcement environment."

Female lawyers to be granted court access in Saudi Arabia
Judicial reforms  At the moment, female lawyers in the kingdom can only work behind the scenes in government and court offices, where they do not come into contact with men. All judges in the kingdom are male religious clerics. As part of ongoing judicial reforms, the Saudi government is developing a network of specialised courts, including "personal status" or family courts, where the women lawyers would be allowed to practice. Women in Saudi Arabia are nearly totally segregated from men in public life. Women have often protested about their treatment Saudi Arabia is planning to bring in a new law to allow women lawyers to argue cases in court for the first time. The law - to be issued "in the coming days" - would allow women to appear in court on family-related cases, including divorce and child custody. At the moment, they can only work behind the scenes in government and court offices. "In accordance with the new law, women will be able to complete their preliminary procedures with notaries by just presenting their IDs," said Ministry of Justice official Osama al-Mirdas, according to Arab News. Under a system of male guardianship, Saudi Arabian women are required to be kept separate from men they are not related to. All are veiled to a greater or lesser degree in public, they are not allowed to drive, and women under 45 must receive permission from a male when they travel.

At least fifteen dead after stampede at Mali mosque
Thousands of pilgrims come to Timbuktu for the prophet's birthday and an official said the accident might have been caused by obstacles resulting from renovation work on the 14th-century mosque made largely from mud. "The mosque is being renovated, financed by the Aga Khan, and the work is carried out by South African specialists," an official at Timbuktu town hall told AFP, asking not to be named. "Because of these renovations, the passage on the north side of the mosque is closed off. On that side, to get through, the faithful found an improvised alleyway. "But the alley couldn't take the number of people using it. Somebody shouted 'someone has died' and panic took over." Two other officials said rescue services had "very quickly" helped the "many injured". He gives us life, he takes it away," said the mosque's imam, who gave his name as Asseyuti. It remains synonymous in Europe with the idea of an exotic faraway land, but the town's historic buildings require constant renovation. BAMAKO, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- A stampede has left 24 people dead including children and at least 20 others injured, some seriously, in Timbuktoo in northwest Mali.

Pacific Rim braces for tsunami following major Chilean earthquake
NZ issues tsunami alert after Chile quake Updated New Zealand has issued a tsunami alert after a huge 8.8 magnitude quake hit off the coast of Chile, sparking a Pacific-wide warning that huge waves may be on the move. But the waves, which would not reach New Zealand until about 15 hours after the Chilean earthquake struck, were not expected to pack destructive force, the government said. "The magnitude of the Chile quake has been confirmed as 8.8. A local tsunami has been confirmed with the highest recorded wave measuring 2.2 meters (7.21 feet)," New Zealand's Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management said. "Current assessment is for a non-destructive tsunami for New Zealand with wave heights at the shore of between 0.2 and one metre (three feet). "The first wave may arrive later and may not be the largest. Waves may continue for several hours," it said, warning New Zealanders to stay off beaches and out of the sea. The warning in New Zealand and a similar one in Australia came after the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii earlier warned of a Pacific-wide tsunami threat following the huge temblor off Chile. "Sea-level readings confirm that a tsunami has been generated which could cause widespread damage," the centre said. "Authorities should take appropriate action in response to this threat." Some 186 people died in Samoa, neighbouring American Samoa and Tonga in September last year after an 8.0 quake spawned a deadly tsunami that battered coastal villages in the island nation.

Apple sues Taiwanese mobile phone maker HTC
SAN FRANCISCO — Apple has relied on slick applications, and even slicker advertisements, to promote the iPhone and maintain its advantage over rivals like Google in the battle to rule the next generation of smartphones. But the fight may come down to something more provincial: who has the best lawyers. On Tuesday, Apple sued HTC, the Taiwanese company that is the largest maker of smartphones running Google’s Android operating system, including the Nexus One, designed and sold by Google. In the lawsuit, filed with the office of the United States International Trade Commission and the United States District Court in Delaware, Apple said that HTC phones running Android violated 20 of its patents, including those relating to the iPhone’s ability to recognize the touch of multiple fingers on its screen at once. Since last fall, Google has been gradually adding multitouch capabilities to phones running Android through software updates. Though the lawsuit singles out HTC, many patent lawyers and analysts say they believe Apple’s target is Google and the Android operating system, which the company gives away to cellphone manufacturers. “We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we can do something about it. We’ve decided to do something about it,” said Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, in a statement. “We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours.” Apple and Google, once close allies, are now fighting for control of the market for smartphones, seen as the most important computing platform of the next decade. The battle has become emotional since last year, when HTC, Motorola and other phone makers began selling Android-based phones that offered a credible alternative to the iPhone. They want to break the Android tsunami.” In a statement, HTC said that it “values patent rights and their enforcement but is also committed to defending its own technology innovations.” The company said it had not yet had an opportunity to review Apple’s claims.

On the trail of Ethiopia aid and guns Images of the famine in Ethiopia moved millions of people around the world to reach in to their pockets and donate to international aid efforts.

The famine, which would soon devastate much of northern Ethiopia, was already evident. I had gone on the long, difficult journey through Sudan and into Eritrea with rebels who had been fighting the government for more than 20 years. My wife, Gill, had come with me. As a nurse she was fascinated by the way the rebels were treating their injured, carrying out difficult operations in makeshift wards dug into the mountains. But now it was time for me to go up to the frontline and for her to go home. Sitting in a bunker, I had no idea where we were in this vast, arid landscape.

Two police officers injured in Pentagon shooting incident
The gunman who charged into one of the Pentagon's main entrances and opened fire has died from gunshot wounds to the head and authorities are looking into his recent rants against the government as a potential motive. John Patrick Bedell, 36, died at the hospital Thursday night after Pentagon police returned fire. Police told ABC News that the two police officers wounded in the shooting have been released from the hospital after suffering minor injuries. While police have said they are not certain of a motive, they are investigating Internet postings in which Bedell wrote and recorded audio expressing his anger toward the government. "The moral values of individuals and communities are increasingly attacked by a political system where deceit is routine and accepted and the only standard is power," he said in the online video. The shooting came just weeks after Joe Stack flew his plane into the IRS office in Austin, Texas, after leaving a lengthy manifesto in which he told the IRS to "take my pound of flesh and sleep well." "It came at the time of night when thousands of Pentagon employees were trying to leave the building at one of the Pentagon's main entrances," ABC News correspondent Martha Raddatz told "Good Morning America's" George Stephanopoulos. As a building-wide announcement notified workers that the Metro had been locked down, employees began trying to make their way to various exits only to find each one blocked. That's when I started to see a backlog of people milling the length of the corridor to the exit," Martinez said.

Non-profit ACORN plans to shut down
The community organizing group Acorn announced Monday that it would close all its remaining state affiliates and field offices by April 1. The organization is “developing a plan to resolve all outstanding debts, obligations and other issues,” said a statement released by the group. Acorn has been battered by criticism from the right and has lost federal money and private donations since a video sting was publicized last fall. Acorn employees were shown in the videos advising two young conservative activists — posing as a pimp and a prostitute — how to conceal their criminal activities. In reaction to the videos, the Census Bureau ended its partnership with the organization for this year’s census, the Internal Revenue Service dropped the group from its Voluntary Income Tax Assistance program, and Congress voted to cut off all grants to the organization. (CNN) -- The community organizing group ACORN announced Monday it is closing its operations amid falling revenues. The announcement came a day after the board of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now met and approved the steps required "to responsibly manage the process of bringing its operations to a close over the coming months," an ACORN statement read. The group's remaining state affiliates and field offices will close by April 1, and a plan will be developed to pay its debts, the statement said. "ACORN's members have a great deal to be proud of -- from promoting homeownership to helping rebuild New Orleans, from raising wages to winning safer streets, from training community leaders to promoting voter participation -- ACORN members have worked hard to create stronger communities, a more inclusive democracy and a more just nation," it said. The 40-year-old liberal group was crippled by scandal six months ago when a pair of conservative activists posing as a pimp and a prostitute secretly videotaped two ACORN employees appearing to give them advice about setting up a prostitution ring and evading the IRS.

UK's ITV cancels police drama "The Bill" after 27 years
Long-running show The Bill to be axed by ITV in autumn after revamp and switch to new 9pm slot fail to revive ratings The Bill, one of the UK's longest-running TV dramas, is to be dropped by ITV in the autumn after 27 years, MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal. ITV has taken the decision to axe the police drama after last year's revamp and switch to a new 9pm slot failed to halt a long-term ratings decline. The Bill was moved last year from being aired twice a week at 8pm on ITV1 to a single slot on Thursdays at 9pm. The show's storylines were tweaked to take account of the new post-watershed slot. In 2002 the show averaged more that 7 million viewers, while more recently audiences been about 3.5 million. Talkback Thames, the independent producer which makes the show, said that it would now enter a consultation process with staff that work on The Bill and was expecting a "significant number of redundancies". The broadcaster said that the decision to drop the series was made as part of a creative rethink of its drama schedule, which has seen the development of popular short run shows such as Collision and Above Suspicion, and not on cost-cutting grounds. ITV intends to use the multimillion-pound saving from axing The Bill to create shorter run drama series for the 9pm slot with projects in the works including a new medical series with writer Peter Bowker and a new series from Collision and Foyle's War writer Anthony Horowitz. "The Bill has been a fixture on our screens for more than 25 years and has been the home of some of the UK's best serial drama storylines, and a great showcase for terrific scriptwriting and fine acting talent," said Peter Fincham, the ITV director of television, channels and online. In the current economic climate the chances of The Bill being picked up by another broadcaster seems slim, with one source describing the costly show as "a victim of circumstance".

The ship was carrying about 100 personnel About 40 sailors are missing after a South Korean navy ship sank near the border with North Korea, Yonhap news agency said citing military officials. The patrol vessel, with 104 people aboard, sank after an unexplained explosion tore through its hull. Several sailors also died, officials are quoted saying as divers prepared to return to the scene after daybreak. South Korean officials played down earlier reports that it may have been the result of an attack by North Korea. There was no sign of the North's military in the area where the ship sank, Yonhap said citing officials. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, who had convened an emergency meeting of security officials, had ordered the military to focus on rescuing the sailors, Yonhap news agency reported. The police force was put on heightened alert in the capital, Seoul. The Cheonan, a 1,200-tonne corvette, began sinking about 2130 local time (1230 GMT) on Friday, after an explosion, the South Korean Navy said. A South Korean presidential spokeswoman said it was premature to say what caused the Cheonan to sink. Strained ties There were reports that another South Korean ship had fired shots toward an unidentified ship in the North following the alleged torpedo attack.

Pakistan: Peshawar hit by triple bomb blasts
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A terrorist attack near the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar, Pakistan, killed two consulate security guards and at least six others Monday, authorities said. The two consulate employees who died were Pakistani, the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad said, and "a number of others were seriously wounded." At least eight people were killed in all, a government official said. All U.S. citizens were accounted for, and some had minor injuries, State Department spokesman P.J. The coordinated attack involved a vehicle suicide bomb and attackers who tried to enter the consulate by using grenades and weapons fire, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. The blasts in the capital of the North West Frontier Province came hours after a suicide attack killed at least 30 people and wounded 50 others in another part of the province. In a phone call to CNN, Azam Tariq, spokesman for Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, said the group was behind the attacks in Peshawar and Dir. The U.S. Embassy, in its statement, said the two attacks reflect "the terrorists' desperation as they are rejected by people throughout Pakistan." Peshawar is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) from Islamabad, the country's capital. Bashir Ahmad Bilour, a senior provincial minister, told reporters at the scene that several militants came in two vehicles. The dead included two Pakistani security personnel working for the U.S. Consulate, one policeman, two civilians and three unidentified bodies, said Karim Khan, a senior police official in Peshawar.

US military to carry out review following Wikileaks release of classified 2007 video
Advertisement The US military is reviewing a video of a controversial helicopter attack on a group of people in Iraq in 2007, officials say. The review comes after footage of the attack was published online by the website WikiLeaks, gaining 4.1 million YouTube viewings. There are, however, no plans to reopen an investigation into the case, a US Central Command spokesman says. An earlier probe into the case cleared the helicopter crew of any war crimes. "Military attorneys are looking at it," a US official, who spoke under condition of anonymity, was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. "I would welcome a thorough new investigation. Reuters from the start has called for transparency and an objective inquiry so that all can learn lessons from this tragedy," Reuters editor-in-chief David Schlesinger said in a statement. "Wikileaks has had more scoops in three years than the Washington Post has had in 30," tweets the internet guru Clay Shirky, and he has a point. The latest and perhaps the most famous (or infamous) is the graphic video Wikileaks unveiled this week of a US Army attack in Iraq in 2007 that left 12 people dead, including two employees of Reuters. The US magazine Mother Jones has an profile of the secret-busting site: WikiLeaks' commitment to what might be called extreme transparency also means that it won't turn away documents that have questionable news value or are just plain dishy. It's posted Sarah Palin's hacked emails and Wesley Snipes' tax returns, as well as fraternity initiation manuals and a trove of secret Scientology manuals. According to WikiLeaks' credo, to refuse a leak is tantamount to helping the bad guys.

UK Prime Minister announces date for general election
Political leaders have headed off on the campaign trail after Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced the UK general election would be held on 6 May. He said he would seek a "clear" mandate to continue the "road to recovery", as Labour bids for a fourth term. David Cameron, whose Conservative Party has been ahead in the polls, said they offered "hope" and a "fresh start". Nick Clegg, leader of the UK's third biggest party the Liberal Democrats, said only they offered "real change". Shortly after announcing the date at Downing Street, Mr Brown boarded a train and headed to Kent to meet voters at a supermarket in Rochester. All three are leading their parties into a general election for the first time. Announcing the widely-predicted 6 May election date after meeting the Queen, Mr Brown said he wanted a "clear and straightforward mandate" to continue the work of economic recovery. He said he would be travelling the country telling voters: "Britain is on the road to recovery and nothing we do should put that recovery at risk." CORRESPONDENT VIEW Ben Wright BBC political correspondent So today we have Labour pitching itself to voters as the party of experience - stewards of an economic recovery that's still fragile, and protector of public services. Gordon Brown is asking the country to stick with him and not risk a switch to the Conservatives.

25 dead after mine explosion in West Virginia
MONTCOAL, W.Va. — Rescue workers began the precarious task Tuesday of removing explosive methane gas from the coal mine where at least 25 miners died the day before. The mine owner’s dismal safety record, along with several recent evacuations of the mine, left federal officials and miners suggesting that Monday’s explosion might have been preventable. In the past two months, miners had been evacuated three times from the Upper Big Branch because of dangerously high methane levels, according to two miners who asked for anonymity for fear of losing their jobs. Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a Democrat whose district includes the mine, said he had received similar reports from miners about recent evacuations at the mine, which as recently as last month was fined at least three times for ventilation problems, according to federal records. The Massey Energy Company, the biggest coal mining business in central Appalachia and the owner of the Upper Big Branch mine, has drawn sharp scrutiny and fines from regulators over its safety and environmental record. In 2008, one of its subsidiaries paid what federal prosecutors called the largest settlement in the history of the coal industry after pleading guilty to safety violations that contributed to the deaths of two miners in a fire in one of its mines. That year, Massey also paid a $20 million fine — the largest of its kind levied by the Environmental Protection Agency — for clean water violations. It is still unclear what caused Monday’s blast, which is under investigation. But the disaster has raised new questions about Massey’s attention to safety under the leadership of its pugnacious chief executive, Don L. Blankenship, and about why stricter federal laws, put into effect after a mining disaster in 2006, failed to prevent another tragedy. Kevin Stricklin, an administrator with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, said the magnitude of the explosion — the worst mining accident in 25 years, which also left four people missing, including a woman working as a mining operator — showed that “something went very wrong here.” “All explosions are preventable,” Mr. Stricklin said. “It’s just making sure you have things in place to keep one from occurring.” Mr. Rahall said that even veteran rescue workers, some with decades of experience, had told him they were shocked by what they saw inside the mine.

Heavy earthquake hits Sumatra, Indonesia
A magnitude 7.7 earthquake shook Indonesia's northwest island of Sumatra early Wednesday, prompting a brief tsunami warning and sending panicked residents rushing for higher ground. There were scattered reports of injuries, but only minor damage in most areas. The quake struck at 5:15 a.m. local time and was centred 205 kilometres northwest of the coastal town of Sibolga in Sumatra at a depth of 31 kilometres, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu issued tsunami warnings following the quake, but lifted them two hours later. A hospital on Simeulue island off the coast of Sumatra admitted 17 people for treatment of injuries sustained in the quake, including four in critical condition, said Capt. He said no larger buildings were reported damaged, but electricity had been knocked out on the island. "We are still collecting reports of damages and injuries ... but the situation has returned to normal and people are going back home," he said. Local network Metro TV reported that a dormitory for nurses partly collapsed in Aceh province's Singkil district and one woman suffered minor injuries in the rush to get out of the building. It said fires sparked by the quake had burned at least 14 houses in Medan, the capital city of North Sumatra province. Paulus Prihandojo, another seismologist with the meteorology agency, said along with the quake's relative depth, the epicentre was too far away from the major population centres of Medan and Banda Aceh to cause major damage. He said areas closer to the epicentre were more sparsely populated and many of the buildings in that area were made of wood, which fares better in earthquakes than brick and cement.

UK interest rates remain at 0.5%
MPC keeps interest rates at historic low despite manufacturing recovery that has allayed fears of double-dip recession The Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) kept interest rates at 0.5% today despite a strong recovery in manufacturing during February that allayed fears of a double-dip recession. Most economists expected the rates freeze after Britain continued to struggle out of recession. While figures from the services sector showed a slight upward trend over the past few months and the UK moved out of recession faster than originally thought in the fourth quarter of 2009, economists believe there could still be bumps on the road to recovery. The looming general election may also play a part in a decision to keep things as they are. A decline in the value of the pound has failed to lift exports significantly. The German economy has stagnated and other trading partners have found their economies stuck in the doldrums, leaving UK exporters with few options when they search for growth. Meanwhile, the fall in February's rate of inflation to 3%, from 3.5% in January, and depressed house prices after a year of modest rises, have soothed concerns about pressure on the Bank for rate hikes. Halifax figures for March showed a 1.1% rise in prices, but most economists expect prices to stagnate in 2010 or decline. The minutes of the Bank's last meeting in March showed "different inferences" over inflation risks as some members worried that growing momentum behind recovery and a weak pound could keep it above the 2% target for longer. Phil Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said that interest rates were likely to remain low for some time: "With the recovery unfolding gradually, there seems little need for additional QE, and it remains too early to start tightening. "The 6 May general election essentially precluded the Bank of England from changing interest rates or QE, given the bank's need to be seen to be politically neutral and independent," he said.

Obama, Medvedev sign treaty cutting nuclear stockpiles
U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev have signed a treaty to reduce their countries' nuclear stockpiles by 25 to 30 percent over seven years. In the Spanish Hall, an ornate chamber within the Czech capital's presidential castle, the two countries, which own more than 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons, agreed to downsize their arsenals. Presidents Obama and Medvedev sat in front of U.S. and Russian flags and signed their countries' first major nuclear arms reduction accord in almost two decades. Mr. Obama said the treaty is a big step forward for world security. "Today is an important milestone for nuclear security and nonproliferation and for U.S.-Russia relations," he said. "That enabled us to do something that just a couple of months ago looked like 'mission impossible.' Within a short span of time we prepared a full-fledged treaty and signed it," he said. The new ten-year pact requires the U.S. and Russia to cut their inventory of nuclear warheads to about 1,500 each in the next seven years. The agreement also slashes by more than half the number of missiles, submarines and bombers that carry the weapons. Tom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association, says the new treaty is significant in reducing the threat from U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons, but more significant because it could lead to further cuts.

Polish President Lech Kaczyński dies as his plane crashes in Russia
President Lech Kaczynski and scores of other senior Polish figures have been killed in a plane crash in Russia. Polish and Russian officials said no-one survived after the plane apparently hit trees as it approached Smolensk airport in thick fog. Russian media reports said the pilots ignored advice from air traffic control to divert to another airport. Poland's army chief, central bank governor, MPs and leading historians were among more than 80 passengers. Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the crash was the most tragic event of the country's post-World War II history. The Polish delegation was flying in from Warsaw to mark the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre of thousands of Poles by Soviet forces during WWII. Obituary: Lech Kaczynski In pictures: Plane crash Your reaction The BBC's Adam Easton, in Warsaw, says the crash is a catastrophe for the Polish people. He says Prime Minister Tusk was reportedly in tears when he was told. After an emergency meeting of ministers, Mr Tusk, who runs the day-to-day business of government, said a week of national mourning had been declared with two minutes of silence on Sunday at midday. Thousands have gathered outside the presidential palace in Warsaw A government spokesman said that according to the constitution there would be an early presidential election, and the speaker of the lower house of parliament, Bronislaw Komorowski, would be acting president. In Warsaw, people gathered outside the presidential palace to lay flowers and light candles. "I'm all broken up... it cannot be expressed in words," Ewa Robaczewska told Reuters news agency.

Car bomb explodes near MI5 army base in Northern Ireland
The bomb was placed in a taxi which was hijacked in north Belfast The Real IRA has admitted it was behind a car bomb which exploded outside the army base which houses MI5's Northern Ireland headquarters. The blast came on the day that David Ford was elected as NI's Justice Minister, the first local politician to hold the job in 38 years. It happened at about 0020 BST outside Palace Barracks, in Holywood, County Down. Police said no warning was given. The bomb went off as the surrounding area was being evacuated. An elderly man walking near the barracks at the time was treated for minor injuries. The bomb was placed in a taxi, which had been hijacked in the Ligoniel area of north Belfast, about seven miles from Holywood, at about 2150 BST. The driver was held hostage by three men for about two hours before being told to drive his taxi to the barracks. The vehicle was abandoned at the base just before midnight prompting police and security staff to evacuate the area. The bomb exploded about 20 minutes later as the evacuation was still taking place. Mr Ford, the new justice minister, said the bombing was a cynical attempt to intimidate politicians ahead of Monday's vote. "Those who carried out last night's attack will not be allowed to succeed in sowing dissension, distrust and disharmony," he said.

Parliament has held a special session to honour those killed in the disaster. The first couple are to be buried on Sunday, a day after a memorial service for the victims in the Polish capital. Weather warning A guard of honour stood to attention in the rain at Warsaw airport as the body of the first lady arrived on a military plane. After a brief religious ceremony, mourners took turns to kneel at Maria Kaczynska's casket and pay their respects as it stood on the tarmac. AT THE SCENE Adam Easton, BBC News, Warsaw Warsaw's neo-classical white presidential palace has become the focal point of national mourning in Poland. Crowds have gathered outside the building every day since Saturday's crash to light candles and lay flowers. Flickering flames in red or yellow glass pots cover the road and pavement in front of the palace. There's so many that street cleaners have to remove large swathes of them every morning leaving streaks of dried candle wax across the pavement flags. Poles are getting on with their daily working lives now, but the people of Warsaw are still taking time in their busy days to make their way in their thousands to the palace to pay their respects.

6.9 magnitude earthquake hits western China
Special Report: 7.1-Magnitude Earthquake hits China's Qinghai Backgrounder: Quake-hit Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yushu in Qinghai Province YUSHU, Qinghai, April 14 (Xinhua) -- About 300 people have died and 8,000 others were injured after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit northwest China's Qinghai Province early on Wednesday, a local official said. Many others are still buried under the debris of collapsed houses near the epicenter, said Huang Limin, deputy secretary-general of the government of the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yushu. About 700 soldiers are now struggling to clear away the rubble and rescue the buried people, a spokesman with the Qinghai Provincial Emergency Office said. More than 5,000 additional rescuers, including soldiers and medical workers have been dispatched to the quake-hit region, according to a news conference held by the Qinghai provincial government. Advertisement At least 300 people have died and thousands are feared hurt after a magnitude-6.9 earthquake struck China's Qinghai province, officials say. The powerful tremor hit remote Yushu county, 500km (310 miles) south-west of provincial capital Xining, at 0749 (2349 GMT), at a shallow depth of 10km. Officials ordered rescue crews and supplies to Yushu, but the area is hundreds of miles from an airport.

Rescue efforts underway after China earthquake
Rescuers were using shovels and their bare hands and working in freezing temperatures. Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, called for an all-out effort to save as many people as possible, with more than 5,000 rescuers including soldiers sent to the disaster zone and the government saying it would provide more than $29m in aid. Logistical hurdles While China's military is well-practiced in responding to disasters, the remote location is posing logistical difficulties. From our correspondent Al Jazeera's Melissa Chan, reporting from Yushu town on Thursday, said it is a very long drive through a mountainous region, with landslides partially blocking the road, to reach the quake zone. "One of the challenges is going to be the altitude … getting to this area can be quite tough and it is taxing on people who are not used to the high elevation," she said. The airport in provincial capital Xining, the nearest big city 860km away, was filled with Chinese troops, firefighters and rescue teams leading dozens of sniffer dogs early on Thursday. They were whisked on to waiting buses for the difficult drive to the quake zone, but that journey takes 12 hours under the best of conditions. Crews set up emergency generators to restore operations at Yushu's airport, and by late afternoon on Wednesday the first of six flights had landed carrying rescue workers and equipment. The small Yushu airport also has no refuelling supplies, so relief flights were carrying extra jet fuel, reducing their capacity for hauling emergency supplies, state media reported. In the cold Still, the rescue effort appeared to be very well-organised, our correspondent said, with many of the convoys already in town bearing signs saying that they had also been at the Sichuan quake in 2008.

European airspace closed by volcanic ash
Advertisement Flights across much of the UK have been grounded for a second day as volcanic ash from Iceland drifts across Europe, posing a potential threat to aircraft. Air traffic control body Nats said airspace restrictions would be lifted in most of Scotland and Northern Ireland from 1900 BST on Friday. But it extended restrictions on airspace in England and Wales until at least 0700 BST on Saturday. European controllers said some 17,000 flights had been cancelled on Friday. The partial lifting of Scottish restrictions on Friday will also cover Shetland and the Orkneys, and will also mean some North Atlantic traffic will be able to operate, Nats said. A tiny number of services are being permitted elsewhere on Friday as the ash clears, mainly in and out of Northern Ireland, western Scotland and south-west England. The disruption is major and unprecedented in Europe [but] unavoidable given the nature of the current problem Brian Flynn Eurocontrol Live: Volcanic cloud over Europe Volcanic ash reaches ground level Two planes were able to fly in and one left Manchester by lunchtime on Friday. Over the next 24 to 36 hours, prevailing winds will shift slightly to drive the central part of the ash plume further to the north toward Scandinavia, according to BBC weather forecaster Matt Taylor. "However, later this weekend, they will return to a northwesterly direction and are more likely to bring the risk of ash back to the UK." Although the winds can be predicted, the crucial factor is how much ash the still-erupting volcano is pumping into the atmosphere. Hundreds of thousands of people have been stranded in the UK or abroad, many unable to return home as a result of the flight cancellations. She said: "We are a party of 10 people including four children, one diabetic, one with ADHD and Aspergers, and a blind lady.

Thai anti-government leaders escape capture
The Thai government's new offensive against anti-government protesters got off to a bad start when efforts to arrest their leaders failed. An investigation is under way into the failed operation. Government officials say they will investigate just how three leaders of the anti-government protests managed to escape when police tried to surround their hotel Friday. One of the leaders climbed down three floors using a rope, and was rushed away by supporters thronging the building. Protest supporter Sanyiam Puy-Thong, who was outside the hotel, says he heard explosions or gunfire inside the building. That is, the government say our leader be the terrorists, then they try to catch. They try to catch our leader, stop our asking for democracy," he said. Officials earlier Friday said the government is preparing to arrest people linked to clashes with security forces last Saturday that left 24 soldiers and protesters dead. UDD supporters have held protests in Bangkok for more than a month.

Europe's airline chaos: in depth
 Virtually all of Europe's major airports remain closed as a huge plume of volcanic ash drifts south and east across the continent from Iceland. Millions of air travellers are stranded as thousands of flights are being cancelled for a third day. The disruption from the spread of ash would continue into Sunday, European aviation agency Eurocontrol said. Airlines are losing some £130m ($200m) a day in an unprecedented shutdown of commercial air travel. "Forecasts suggest that the cloud of volcanic ash will persist and that the impact will continue for at least the next 24 hours," a statement from Eurocontrol said at around 0830 GMT. Many countries and airlines have grounded fleets as the ash - a mixture of glass, sand and rock particles, drifting from 5,000ft (1,500m) - can seriously damage aircraft engines. Some 18,000 of the 28,000 daily flights in the affected zone were cancelled on Friday, twice as many as the day before. The UK extended its ban on commercial flights until at least 0700 local time (0600 GMT) on Sunday. Many other countries, from Ireland to Ukraine, have either closed airspace or shut key airports. The disruption has now affected millions of travellers since Wednesday when the Eyjafjallajoekull volcano began erupting for the second time in a month. Scientists in Iceland said they hoped to fly above the volcano to assess how much ice has melted, now that winds have cleared visibility.

 EU transport ministers are to hold emergency talks by video conference on easing the air travel crisis caused by a volcanic ash cloud in Europe's skies. More than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far, as the crisis enters its fifth day. Airports and airlines are questioning the need for curbs said to be costing airlines $200m (£130m) a day.

British government apologises for suggesting the Pope could create a brand of "Benedict" condoms
The Foreign Office has apologised for a "foolish" document suggesting the Pope could launch "Benedict" condoms during his visit to the UK this year. The memo also suggested the pontiff could be invited to open an abortion clinic and bless a gay marriage. The Foreign Office stressed the paper, which resulted from a "brainstorm" on the visit, did not reflect its views. The trip by Pope Benedict XVI could not have come at a more difficult time for a Catholic Church embroiled in a wide-reaching child abuse scandal and a simmering, theological row with the Church of England. The need for the British Government to handle the pontiff’s stay with the greatest sensitivity could not have been more obvious. Yet last night that decision had backfired spectacularly, with the emergence of an official document circulated around Whitehall — and leaked to The Sunday Telegraph — which mocked the Pope and ridiculed the teachings of the Catholic Church. The Foreign Office was forced to make the most fulsome of apologies, while a senior civil servant has been transferred to other duties. Among the proposals put forward by members of the Papal Visit Team during a “brainstorming” session and included in the document, headed “The ideal visit would see ...”, were plans for the Pope to open an abortion ward and bless a gay marriage.

Oil spill in Gulf of Mexico reported to have reached coast; offshore drilling ban announced by Obama administration
NEW ORLEANS — Officials in the Obama administration began for the first time Friday to publicly chastise BP America for its handling of the spreading oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico, calling the oil company’s current resources inadequate to stop what is unfolding into an environmental catastrophe. As oil edged toward the Louisiana coast, fears continued to grow that the leak from the seabed oil well could spiral out of control. One official at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in a widely distributed warning on Friday, said the oil flow could grow from the current estimate of 5,000 barrels a day to “an order of magnitude higher than that.” The increased level of concern was reflected in the sharp new criticism by federal officials of BP for not stopping the leak and cleaning up the spill before it reached land, something the company’s officials had said was possible earlier in the week. “It is clear that after several unsuccessful attempts to secure the source of the leak, it is time for BP to supplement their current mobilization as the slick of oil moves toward shore,” Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said pointedly, as the government announced steps to supplement its response with people and equipment from the Defense Department. Geoffrey S. Morrell, deputy assistant secretary of defense, said in a statement that the government would hold BP accountable for the cost of the department’s deployment, which as of Friday night included the Louisiana National Guard to help clean up coastal areas once the oil comes ashore. BP officials said they did everything possible, and a review of the response suggests it may be too simplistic to place all the blame on the oil company. The federal government also had opportunities to move more quickly, but did not do so while it waited for a resolution to the spreading spill from BP, which was leasing the drilling rig that exploded in flames on April 20 and sank two days later. The Department of Homeland Security waited until Thursday to declare that the incident was “a spill of national significance,” and then set up a second command center in Mobile. The actions came only after the estimate of the size of the spill was increased fivefold to 5,000 barrels a day. The delay meant that the Homeland Security Department waited until late this week to formally request a more robust response from the Department of Defense, with Ms. Napolitano acknowledging even as late as Thursday afternoon that she did not know if the Defense Department even had equipment that might be helpful. By Friday afternoon, she said, the Defense Department had agreed to send two large military transport planes to spray chemicals that can disperse the oil while it is still in the Gulf. Officials initially seemed to underestimate the threat of a leak, just as BP did last year when it told the government such an event was highly unlikely. Rear Adm. Mary E. Landry, the chief Coast Guard official in charge of the response, said on April 22, after the rig sank, that the oil that was on the surface appeared to be merely residual oil from the fire, though she said it was unclear what was going on underwater. The day after, officials said that it appeared the well’s blowout preventer had kicked in and that there did not seem to be any oil leaking from the well, though they cautioned it was not a guarantee.

Bomb scare closes Times Square, New York
A crude car bomb of propane, gasoline and fireworks was discovered in a smoking Nissan Pathfinder in the heart of Times Square on Saturday evening, prompting the evacuation of thousands of tourists and theatergoers on a warm and busy night. Although the device had apparently started to detonate, there was no explosion, and early on Sunday the authorities were still seeking a suspect and motive. “We are very lucky,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a 2:15 a.m. press conference. “We avoided what could have been a very deadly event.” A large swath of Midtown — from 43rd Street to 48th Street, and from Sixth to Eighth Avenues — was closed for much of the evening after the Pathfinder was discovered just off Broadway on 45th Street.

At 6:28 p.m., Mr. Kelly said, a video surveillance camera recorded what was believed to be the dark green Nissan S.U.V. Moments later, a T-shirt vendor on the sidewalk saw smoke coming out of vents near the back seat of the S.U.V., which was now parked awkwardly at the curb with its engine running and its hazard lights on. The vendor called to a mounted police officer, the mayor said, who smelled gunpowder when he approached the S.U.V. The police began evacuating Times Square, starting with businesses along Seventh Avenue, including a Foot Locker store and a McDonald’s. Police officers from the emergency service unit and firefighters flooded the area and were troubled by the hazard lights and running engine, and by the fact that the S.U.V.

Continental and United Airlines to merge
The $3 billion merger of UAL Corp. and Continental Airlines Inc. is expected to incur $1.2 billion in one-time transaction costs over three years, assuming the deal passes muster with antitrust regulators, the companies said Monday. The resulting company, United Continental Holdings Inc., would be the world's largest airline by traffic, with an equity value of $8.3 billion at current share prices on a fully diluted basis. First, United’s fortunes have begun to turn around after deep cost and capacity cuts. And as the economy starts to improve, airlines are eager to position themselves for a rebound in air travel, particularly from lucrative business travelers.

Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua reported dead
Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua has died at his presidential villa following a long illness. The government announced seven days of national mourning and said the president would be buried on Thursday. Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan has been sworn in as head of state in a ceremony in the capital Abuja. Mr Yar'Adua, 58, came to power in 2007 promising many reforms. Analysts say he made the most progress in tackling unrest in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Nigerian TV interrupted normal programming to announce the news in a brief statement early on Thursday. ANALYSIS Martin Plaut, BBC World Service Africa editor The uncertainty at the heart of Nigeria has been tremendously destabilising. There has been considerable unrest in the central state of Jos recently with clashes between Muslims and Christians, and people put this down partly at least to the fact that there was not a firm hand at the centre of power. But this does cause difficulties because there is a convention that this was the turn of the Nigerian Muslims from the north to control Nigeria and Goodluck Jonathan is from the south. He will be taking over during the turn of the Nigerian northerners, the Muslims, to control Nigeria. Obituary: President Umaru Yar'Adua The announcer said: "The president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, died a few hours ago at the presidential villa.

Most of the injuries were said to be minor [Updated 10:03 a.m.] A ferry boat crashed into the Staten Island Ferry terminal Saturday morning, the New York Police Department said. Some minor injuries have been reported, the New York Fire Department told CNN. The fire department said no major injuries have been reported and the cause of the crash was under investigation. A Staten Island ferry with a history of accidents malfunctioned as it approached its terminal Saturday and smashed into a pier with a jolt that tossed passengers to the deck and hurt as many as 37 people.

Russia agrees to construct Turkish nuclear reactor
The two countries want to double bilateral trade in five years President Dmitry Medvedev has agreed a deal under which Russia will build Turkey's first nuclear power plant. Russia will have a controlling stake in the plant, which is likely to cost $20bn (£13.5bn) and is to be built on Turkey's Mediterranean coast. It was one of several agreements struck by Mr Medvedev during a visit to Ankara, the Turkish capital. Both countries said they wished to improve trade links, lift visa conditions and boost energy projects. "We share a determination to increase the trade volume from a current $38bn to $100bn in five years," Turkish President Abdullah Gul said after hosting talks with Mr Medvedev. ISTANBUL—Russia and Turkey signed several energy and trade agreements Wednesday, tying the knot in a relationship between historic rivals that has quietly grown into what Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev described as "a full-scale strategic partnership." “Our shores are under severe danger during the passage of the oil tankers through the straits,” he said. “Once we realize the Samsun-Ceyhan pipeline, we would have the opportunity to reach out to the world from Ceyhan.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story For his part, Mr. Medvedev highlighted the expected increases in the $30 billion in trade between Turkey and Russia. “Our trading capacity will not only improve but will exceed past records,” Mr. Medvedev said. “We are aiming for more than $100 billion of trade in future, which is very inspiring.” His comments, in Russian, were translated by Turkish television.

US Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan meets with senators on Capitol Hill
Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan on Wednesday kicked off what has become a ritual for modern high court nominees: making the rounds of key senators' offices on Capitol Hill while saying little to a boisterous press corps in tow. Kagan, who won confirmation as solicitor general a little more than a year ago, started her day meeting with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. Democrats offered overwhelming praise for the 50-year-old nominee, saying she would be a fair, independent member of the high court and a worthy replacement for retiring Justice John Paul Stevens. Republicans questioned, among other things, Kagan's lack of experience on the federal bench and whether she would be willing to oppose President Obama's agenda when necessary. "There's nothing more exciting than the [confirmation process] we're about to undertake," Reid told Kagan. "The great country that we're in is ruled by law, and that's what you're going to make sure continues." Reid later issued a statement that said his meeting left him confident that Kagan "is the right choice to replace Justice Stevens on the Supreme Court. She has a strong belief that the Supreme Court should be a forum where the rule of law wins out and where people from every walk of life can receive a fair hearing." McConnell said on the Senate floor that it's his "hope that the Obama administration doesn't think the ideal Supreme Court nominee is someone who would rubber-stamp its policies. And it's a question that needs to be answered." "Americans want to know that Ms. Kagan will be independent, that she won't prejudge cases based on her personal opinions, [and] that she'll treat everyone equally, as the judicial oath requires."

Interim Kyrgyz government retakes buildings after violent protests
“The former president again spilled the blood of Kyrgyz citizens,” Ms. Otunbayeva said in a statement carried by local news media. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Government officials said Thursday that they would not use police force, but instead would encourage supporters to swarm into the buildings held by armed followers of Mr. Bakiyev. The result was a strange tableau of violence as the pro-government groups — some peaceful and some armed with sticks, rocks and rifles — stormed the government buildings while uniformed police officers and special forces largely stayed on the sidelines, witnesses said. The loyalty of those forces in the south has been in question. Kyrgyzstan, in Central Asia, is the home of a base used to supply the United States-led war in Afghanistan. They are unelected and have no formal legitimacy, and it remains unclear whom the police and the army are siding with, particularly in the south.

Efforts to cap Deepwater Horizon oil spill delayed again
— As BP’s experimental efforts to reduce the flow of oil spewing from disabled well in the Gulf of Mexico met another obstacle, the Obama administration sought assurances from BP that it would not attempt to limit its liability to the $75 million prescribed by law. In a letter sent Friday to Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive officer, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano cited statements by BP officials that the company would pay all legitimate claims and that the company considered the $75 million cap “irrelevant.” “Based on these statements, we understand that BP will not in any way seek to rely on the potential $75 million statutory cap to refuse to provide compensation to any individuals or others harmed by the oil spill, even if more than $75 million is required to provide full compensation to all claimants, and BP will not seek reimbursement from the American taxpayers, the United States government or the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for any amount,” the two cabinet members wrote in their letter, which was made public on Saturday. “In the event that our understanding is inaccurate, we request immediate public clarification of BP’s true intentions,” they wrote. BP says the new dome should be working by the end of the week A new steel dome has been placed beside the damaged oil well that has been polluting the Gulf of Mexico since last month's drilling rig disaster, BP says. Dubbed the "top hat", it is smaller than a first container dome which had to be set aside after becoming blocked by crystallised gas hydrates. It is on the seabed but is being kept away from the well for now, BP said. The cost of tackling the spill is being put at $118m (£80m), much of which the Obama administration expects BP to pay. The figure is contained in legislation sent to Congress, which would also increase a tax on oil companies to provide funds for clear-up work. The bill would also raise the liability cap on how much oil companies must pay for economic damage caused by a spill at one of their wells. Eleven people died when an explosion - thought to have occurred after a surge of methane gas from deep within the well - destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April. Samples from the carcasses found in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama since 2 May have been sent for testing. A National Marine Fisheries Service official said none of them had obvious signs of oil and it was common for dead dolphins to wash up at this time of year, when they are in shallow waters to calve.

Afghanistan: Suicide attackers kill several people in Kabul
Advertisement A suicide car bomber has killed 18 people - including five US soldiers - and injured 52 more in the deadliest attack this year on foreign troops in the Afghan capital. Most of the victims were Afghan civilians caught in the blast when the bomber targeted a Nato-led convoy. The bomber struck during rush hour close to the parliament. Taliban militants said they had carried out the attack, using a van packed with 750kg (1,650lb) of explosives. ANALYSIS Nick Childs, BBC defence and security correspondent Nato is making no bones about the fact that it's trying to wrest the military initiative in Afghanistan back from the insurgents. So, in the battle for perceptions and hearts and minds, this will be a serious blow, with the high loss of life both of Nato troops and local civilians. It also highlights the fact that, despite increased efforts, it is impossible completely to eliminate such attacks. And such so-called "spectaculars", especially in the capital, remain a potent weapon for the insurgents, even as the Nato-led forces prepare to continue their own new strategy centred around retaking control in the south. Despite tight security, the suicide bomber managed to drive into the city in a car laden with explosives. A spokesman for the Nato-led international peacekeeping force Isaf confirmed that six of its soldiers had been killed. Apart from the five US soldiers, one Canadian is believed to have been killed. Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen "strongly" condemned the attack, but said the alliance remained "committed to its mission to protect the Afghan people and to strengthen Afghanistan's ability to resist terrorism".

Image caption The synthetic cell looks identical to the 'wild type' Scientists in the US have succeeded in developing the first living cell to be controlled entirely by synthetic DNA. The researchers constructed a bacterium's "genetic software" and transplanted it into a host cell. The resulting microbe then looked and behaved like the species "dictated" by the synthetic DNA. The advance, published in Science, has been hailed as a scientific landmark, but critics say there are dangers posed by synthetic organisms. But the researchers hope eventually to design bacterial cells that will produce medicines and fuels and even absorb greenhouse gases. Now, the scientists have put both methods together, to create what they call a "synthetic cell", although only its genome is truly synthetic.

New BP oil spill plan
BP uncertain mud plug will stop leak Updated Frustration is mounting in Washington over BP's failure to seal the leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, but senior Obama administration officials say there is no viable alternative. The oil company has delayed an attempt at plugging the leaking well with heavy mud and cement until later in the week. And after more than a month of leaking oil, the people of America's Gulf Coast have had enough of missed deadlines and excuses. They can see the oil now and know there is more coming. Louisiana's Republican governor Bobby Jindal has described what he saw touring some of the worst affected islands and wetlands. "We saw islands covered in oil where our brown pelicans nest," he said. "We could actually see multiple birds oiled, some to the point where they couldn't fly. A few days ago we took a boat out to Pass a Loutre and we saw thick black-and-brown coloured oil covering much of the perimeter of the marsh out there. The government has declared a "fishery disaster" in the seafood-producing states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, making them eligible for federal funds. With BP failing to shut off the damaged well, Mr Jindal is demanding an emergency permit from US federal authorities to use dredges to build barrier islands to try and hold back the pollution. But homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano says Washington is worried that such a drastic move could have other, unintended, consequences.

BP says Gulf oil spill slowed as estimates of oil spilled increase
BP has slowed the flow of oil and gas from a ruptured well into the Gulf of Mexico, a US official told local media. The company's "top kill" effort has "stabilised the wellhead", Coast Guard commander Admiral Thad Allen said. But he cautioned it was too early to declare success. This is the first step in BP's plan to seal the well for good. Meanwhile, a panel of US scientists said the oil leak was much worse than previously estimated, making it the nation's worst spill. US Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt saidBP 'slows leaking Gulf oil well' government teams estimated the flow ranges from 12,000 barrels (504,000 gallons or 1.9 million litres) to 25,000 barrels per day. Official resigns Later on Thursday, President Barack Obama is expected to extend a moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling for six months, the White House has said. Elizabeth "Liz" Birnbaum, who had run the MMS since July 2009, has endured criticism in the weeks since the oil spill over alleged lax oversight of drilling and what President Obama has called an overly cozy relationship with industry. 'Low pressure' Adm Allen told US media the "top kill" procedure, which began on Wednesday, has pumped enough drilling fluid to block some of the oil and gas escaping from the well.

At least 65 dead after train derailment in West Bengal, India
Maoist guerillas are believed to be behind the blast in their West Bengal stronghold. If confirmed it would mark a major escalation of their insurgency in the state and a shift from military to civilian targets. Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has described the Maoist rebellion as the country's greatest internal security challenge - they are a powerful force in one-third of India's 600-plus districts. The explosion follows a number of Maoist attack attacks in recent weeks, including an ambush which killed 76 Indian paramilitary police in Chhattisgarh and an attack on a bus which left 35 dead. This time the attackers struck at 1:30am as the Mumbai-Calcutta Gyaneshwari Express passed through Jhargram in West Midnapore, West Bengal, just over 80 miles from its destination. The driver heard an explosion which derailed 13 of the train's coaches and hurled five of them into the path of an on-coming freight train. India's railways minister Mamata Bannerjee said the incident was "definitely sabotage" and that a bomb attack had derailed the train. "From whatever I have been told the apprehension is the Maoists were involved," she said. Police investigating the attack said they were also exploring whether the removal of the track's "fish plates" by saboteurs had caused the derailment and collision. A detail investigation will reveal more, but definitely there was lot of tinkering done to the tracks," Vivek Sahay, a senior railway official, said.

"We ask for respect for our privacy and that of our family, and we do not intend to comment further." Al Gore, 62, a Democrat, who was Bill Clinton's vice president for eight years, narrowly lost the presidency to Republican George W. Bush in 2000 and won a Nobel Peace Prize and an Academy Award in 2007 for his work against global climate change. She was active in the 1980s in trying to get record companies to put warning labels on their records about profane lyrics. The Gores left the impression of a couple deeply in love during the Democratic National Convention in 2000, when they exchanged a long, passionate kiss on stage that became famous.

French Open: Stosur and Schiavone to compete in women's final; Nadal to meet Soderling in men's final
(CNN) -- Sweden's Robin Soderling ended world number one Roger Federer's defense of his French Open crown after a rain-affected four-set victory at Roland Garros. Soderling had never beaten Federer in their 12 previous meetings but battled back from a set down to record a 3-6 6-3 7-5 6-4 triumph in just under three hours. Federer's defeat ended his incredible run of reaching 23 Grand Slam semifinals in a row, and he could lose his world number one status by the end of the tournament if Rafael Nadal regains the French Open title. Fifth seed Soderling looked to be heading for another defeat as Federer took the opening set in just over half an hour after breaking in the eighth game. But Soderling rallied superbly in the second to win the first three games and close out the set. The third went with serve until 5-5 when the players were forced off due to rain but when they returned Soderling broke Federer thanks to a fierce forehand winner. He then held serve to take the set. Federer grabbed an early break in the fourth set but Soderling hit back to level at 2-2, before breaking again in the eighth game. He then served out the match to seal his place in the final four. After the game Soderling told reporters: "First set he [Federer] played well, and I didn't serve too well, and he had some chances in the second set and I saved a couple of really important points. "I think when I won the second set, which was a very big thing, I felt I could relax. This is a big win but it's not the final and I don't want to celebrate too much, I want to focus on the next game."

Hewlett-Packard to cut 9,000 jobs in $1 billion restructuring plan
Image caption Hewlett-Packard cut 6,700 jobs last year to make savings Hewlett-Packard (HP) says it plans to spend $1bn (£686m) and shed 9,000 jobs over three years as it creates fully-automated commercial data centres. HP, the world's largest technology company by sales, says the job cuts will be the result of productivity gains and automation. HP said the resulting "next-generation services" would benefit clients. The firm said it would record a $1bn financial cost charge in the course of its 2013 financial year. "As a result of productivity gains and automation, HP expects to eliminate roughly 9,000 positions over a multi-year period to reinvest for further growth and to increase shareholder value," it said. It said the shake-up would make it annual gross savings of about $1bn and net savings "after reinvestment in a range between $500m and $700m". HP added that it would replace about 6,000 of the jobs that were lost, adding that the changes to the workforce would be made over time and would vary by country. And it said the commercial data centres would help its corporate clients run their businesses faster and more efficiently. The latest job losses come after 6,700 posts were shed last year to make savings. HP to cut workforce by 3,000   NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Hewlett-Packard plans to eliminate 3,000 jobs over the next few years as it ramps up its use of automated data centers for business customers, the company announced Tuesday. The world's largest computer company said it will invest $1 billion in building up its automated data centers to service business customers. HP will cut about 9,000 jobs in its enterprise services division as a result, but over the same time period, the company expects to add about 6,000 employees to its sales and delivery teams. HP (HPQ, Fortune 500) will take a charge of about $1 billion to reflect the investment, and expects it to pay off in annual savings of about the same. After reinvesting some of that money, HP expects these moves to boost annual pre-tax earnings by between $500 million and $700 million by fiscal year 2013.

Turkey mourns flotilla dead
Funerals have been held in Turkey for the nine activists killed when Israeli forces stormed their Gaza-bound aid flotilla. Coffins swathed in Turkish and Palestinian flags were taken to the Fatih Mosque in Istanbul as thousands gathered to mourn the dead, eight of whom were Turks and one a US national of Turkish origin. Cigdem Topcuoglu (L), the widow of activist Cetin Topcuoglu, reacts as she accepts condolences from a mourner next to the coffin of her husband, a national taekwando athlete. Injured activists also paid their respects after being deported from Israel and flown to a military airport in Turkey. Earlier, hundreds of other activists returned home after being expelled by Israel. Hundreds of Turkish nationals were flown to Istanbul, where they received an enthusiastic welcome from crowds of hundreds of supporters shouting anti-Israeli slogans. More than 30 Greek activists, three French activists and one US national were flown to Athens. They, too, were greeted by family and supporters shouting pro-Palestinian slogans. The bodies were flown from Israel to Istanbul, along with more than 450 activists, to a heroes' welcome. Israel has said there is no need for an international inquiry into the incident, insisting its own will meet the "highest international standards". But in an interview on CNN, he also says Israel does have "legitimate security concerns" in Gaza.

Large fires kill many in Dhaka, Bangladesh
Fire fighters work at the scene after a devastating fire in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, early June 4, 2010. (Xinhua/Cheng Zhang) The firefighters rushed to the spot soon and brought the fire under control after three hours of relentless efforts. "We'll pay 20,000 taka (285.71 U.S. dollars) as compenstation to the family of each victim," he said adding the government has already formed a probe committee which will give a report within seven days. This is the second deadly disaster to strike the capital in 72 hours after a five-story building collapsed on Tuesday night, killing 25 people. A devastating fire raced through several apartment complexes in the capital, Dhaka, on Thursday night, killing more than 100 people and injuring dozens, officials and local media reported. A fire official, Nazrul Islam, said the blaze started when an electric transformer exploded, igniting a three-story apartment building in the Najirabazar area of old Dhaka. The television station ATN Bangla reported Friday that at least 104 people had died, and that more than 100 people were injured. By Anis Ahmed DHAKA (Reuters) - At least 114 people were killed in a fire that razed a crowded, centuries-old Dhaka neighborhood overnight as rescue workers scrambled on Friday to pull bodies, many charred beyond recognition, from smoldering debris. The blaze, which broke out about 10.30 p.m., was the worst to sweep through the Bangladeshi capital in almost four decades. "The confirmed death toll from the fire is now 114 and may rise," Muhibul Haque, district commissioner of Dhaka, told Reuters. Fuelling the flames, which some witnesses said rose up to six-storeys high, were chemicals from illegal, home-based factories in the Kayettuli neighborhood, one of the most densely populated in Dhaka and in the heart of the city. "It seemed like hell broke loose," said a wailing woman, looking for her daughter and son in what remained of the area, home to several multi-storey blocks and tin-roofed dwellings.

WHO's reaction to H1N1 influenced by drug companies, reports claim
European criticism of the World Health Organization's handling of the H1N1 pandemic intensified Friday with the release of two reports that accused the agency of exaggerating the threat posed by the virus and failing to disclose possible influence by the pharmaceutical industry on its recommendations for how countries should respond. The WHO's response caused widespread, unnecessary fear and prompted countries to waste millions of dollars, according to one report. At the same time, the Geneva-based arm of the United Nations relied on advice from experts with ties to drug makers in developing the guidelines it used to encourage countries to stockpile millions of doses of antiviral medication, according to the second report. A spokesman for the WHO and several independent experts strongly disputed the reports, saying they misrepresented the seriousness of the pandemic and the agency's response, which was carefully formulated and necessary, given the potential threat. "The idea that we declared a pandemic when there wasn't a pandemic is both historically inaccurate and downright irresponsible," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said in a telephone interview. To insinuate that this was not a pandemic is very disrespectful to the people who died from it." The first report, released in Paris, came from the Social, Health and Family Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which launched an investigation in response to allegations that the WHO's reaction to the swine flu pandemic was influenced by drug companies that make antiviral drugs and vaccines. The second report, a joint investigation by the BMJ, a prominent British medical journal, and the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, criticized the WHO's 2004 guidelines, which were developed based in part on the advice of three experts who received consulting fees from the two leading manufacturers of antiviral drugs used against the virus, Roche and GlaxoSmithKline. It would be surprising if they didn't because the best experts are sought by all organizations," Hartl said. The British Medical Journal says the scientists had openly declared these interests in other publications yet WHO made no mention of the links.

Rescue underway for teen solo sailor
Sailor's parents unswayed by critics The Sutherlands say Abby's skills, not age, are key. Experts see a mix of factors at work, including the culture's ambivalence about teenagers. An article in Saturday's Section A about the parents of teen sailor Abby Sunderland and their response to critics of her attempt to sail around the world referred to the family, in a subheadline, as the Sutherlands. "Age is not a criteria. "If people are looking at age, they're looking at the wrong thing here," Laurence Sunderland told reporters Friday outside the family's home in Thousand Oaks as a rescue ship headed to where Abby Sunderland had been spotted the night before, adrift in her damaged boat in the southern Indian Ocean. To the legions of critics who have questioned why they allowed their 16-year-old daughter to sail solo around the world, Laurence and Marianne Sunderland offered no apologies Friday. In an era when social scientists worry about "helicopter parents" hovering over their offspring, shielding them from dangers real and invented, the saga of the globe-circling, teenage solo sailor presents a dramatic counterpoint. Abby set sail from Marina del Rey on Jan. 23 and was roughly halfway through her attempted round-the-world solo sail when her 40-foot boat, Wild Eyes, apparently lost a mast in rough seas. Her family lost contact with her early Thursday morning, and many feared the worst until she was located by an Australian spotter jet late Thursday night.

Women reveal accounts of forced abortion in Scientology
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's campaign is out with a new ad criticizing his Republican opponent in the Nevada Senate race, Sharron Angle, for advocating a phase-out of Social Security and Medicare. In it, a narrator says that Social Security means "independence" and "a secure income" - and that Angle "shockingly" wants to wipe the program out. "She'd cut benefits for everyone coming into the system," the narrator says. The spot also touches on Angle's reported onetime support for "championing a program there that was developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard" that uses saunas and massages in prisons. As Jon Ralston notes (via Politico's Ben Smith), Angle was on Fox News this morning, where she called the notion that she wants to get rid of Social Security "nonsense" despite her calls for it to be phased out. (She also claimed Reid "waterboarded" the economy.) "I have always said we need to make the lockbox a lockbox, put the money in there for our senior citizens," she said. "They came here in good faith paying into a system and Harry Reid has put an IOU in for 24 years. What we need to do is personalize Social Security so the government can no longer raid it." Angle has previously called Social Security "a broken system without much to recommend it." Reid is relatively unpopular in Nevada, with an approval rating hovering around just 40 percent; his electoral strategy is predicated in large part on convincing Nevada voters that while they may not love him, they don't really have a better option. By virtue of her controversial positions, Angle is believed to be the sort of candidate against whom Reid could successfully executive such a strategy and achieve an unlikely reelection victory.

Bomb left outside police station in Northern Ireland
Hundreds of people evacuated in Aughnacloy, County Tyrone, after 300lb bomb left in van outside local police station A 300lb bomb was left in a van outside a border police station in Northern Ireland last night, police confirmed today. Hundreds of people living near the police station in Aughnacloy, County Tyrone, were evacuated. Dissident republicans using a recognised codeword phoned a Belfast newsroom last night warning that a bomb had been placed in the van. Army bomb experts have been examining the white vehicle overnight. A police spokesman said about 350 residents including children spent the night in three community halls during the security alert. The main street in Aughnacloy is only partially open and the A5 road linking Derry to the Republic is accessible, although the Aughnacloy to Dungannon road is closed. Dissidents have been responsible for several bomb attacks on police stations and other buildings across Northern Ireland in recent months. Local Democratic Unionist councillor Sammy Brush said: "There is nothing getting in, or out, of the vicinity of the police station. Had it gone off, it would have caused serious destruction and death."

The newlyweds were transported to the Royal Palace, for an evening banquet with guests from around the world. Guests attending the festivities include the Norwegian and Danish royal families, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, Prince Albert of Monaco, and the UK's Earl and Countess of Wessex. Sweden's monarchy has no political power, but the king or queen represents the nation and greets foreign dignitaries. The plot of one of Europe's most high-profile royal relationships will reach its denouement tomorrow when Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria marries fitness trainer Daniel Westling.

US Senator Robert Byrd dies at age 92
Washington (CNN) -- West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, the self-educated son of a coal miner who became the longest-serving member of Congress, died early Monday at age 92, the senator's office said. Byrd, a nine-term Democrat, was known as a master of the chamber's often-arcane rules and as the self-proclaimed "champion of the Constitution," a jealous guardian of congressional power. His speeches were laced with references to poetry and the Greek and Roman classics, often punctuated by the brandishing of his pocket copy of the national charter. He was also known as the "King of Pork," using top positions on the Senate Appropriations Committee to steer federal spending to his home state -- one of the nation's poorest. "Pork, to the critic, is service to the people who enjoy some of the good things in life, and I've been happy to bring to West Virginia the projects to which they refer. I have no apology for it," he said. He was an outspoken opponent of the war in Iraq, calling his 2002 vote against a "blind and improvident" authorization of military action the proudest moment of his career. Joe Manchin -- a Democrat -- has the power to appoint a replacement for Byrd, whose current term is set to expire in 2013. When Byrd entered Congress in January 1953, a postage stamp cost 3 cents and American kids were clamoring for a new toy called Mr.

Eleven alleged Russian spies arrested in US
Ten alleged members of a Russian spy-ring have been charged in the US with acting as foreign agents. The suspects are accused of posing as ordinary citizens, some living together as couples for years. They were charged with conspiracy to act as unlawful agents of a foreign government, a crime which carries up to five years in prison. There are a lot of contradictions," spokesman Igor Lyakin-Frolov told the AFP news agency, declining further comment. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov later said Moscow expected Washington to provide an explanation over the the spying row, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. Nine of the alleged spies also face a charge of conspiracy to launder money, which carries a 20-year prison sentence. Russian spy stories may be a throwback to the Cold War and sound alarming but they probably don't surprise anyone in Washington, especially not in the government. US officials who travel to Moscow routinely turn off their BlackBerries and leave them on the plane to make sure data on their phones remains out of reach of any tech-savvy Russian intelligence agents.

Three arrested in al-Qaeda bomb plot
OSLO (AP)  Three suspected al-Qaeda members were arrested Thursday for what Norwegian and U.S. officials said was a terrorist plot linked to similar plans to bomb New York's subway and blow up a shopping mall in England. Officials believe the men were planning attacks with portable but powerful bombs like the ones at the heart of last year's failed suicide attack in the New York City subway, an attack U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has called one of the most serious plots since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. On Wednesday, U.S. prosecutors revealed the existence of a related plot in Manchester, England. The plots underscore al-Qaeda's interest in smaller-level attacks that don't require the intricate planning and coordination of Sept. 11, in which airplanes were hijacked and flown into the World Trade Center towers in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington, Va. And they follow a trend in which the terrorist group has used operatives inside potential target countries, rather than trying to sneak people across increasingly secure borders. The three men, whose names were not released, had been under surveillance for more than a year. Officials would not say what country or site was the target of the latest terror threat, or even whether they believed the men had selected a target. Those arrested in Norway included a 39-year-old Norwegian of Uighur origin who has lived in the country since 1999 and a 31-year-old citizen of Uzbekistan who had a permanent Norwegian residency permit, said Janne Kristiansen, head of Norway's Police Security Service. The man arrested in Germany is a 37-year-old Iraqi with a Norwegian residency permit, Kristiansen said. Kristiansen did not say exactly where the arrests took place but said all three men "had connections to Oslo." Norwegian and U.S. officials believe the Norway plan was organized by Salah al-Somali, al-Qaeda's former chief of external operations who is in charge of plotting attacks worldwide. al-Qaeda usually keeps its plots compartmentalized, and officials do not believe the suspects in Norway knew about the other plots.

CNN journalist fired for controversial Twitter message
CNN International has fired one of its senior editors after she published a Twitter message lamenting the death of a Lebanese Shi'ite cleric. The above tweet by Octavia Nasr referred to the Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, an early mentor of the militant group Hezbollah who died in Beirut on Sunday. Nasr, a 20-year CNN veteran based in Atlanta, departed from the channel after "a conversation" with Parisa Khosravi, a CNN senior vice president. The channel was reported by the New York Times to have been alerted to the tweet by some supporters of Israel. Fadlallah was also the spiritual leader of Hezbollah when it was formed after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, though he later distanced himself from its ties with Iran. Nasr is quoted in a BBC report as calling her tweet "an error of judgment". She said she had been referring to Fadlallah's "pioneering" views on women's rights. She said in a blog posting: "Reaction to my tweet was immediate, overwhelming and provides a good lesson on why 140 characters should not be used to comment on controversial or sensitive issues, especially those dealing with the Middle East." CNN on Wednesday removed its senior editor for Middle Eastern affairs, Octavia Nasr, from her job after she published a Twitter message saying that she respected the Shiite cleric the Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, who died on Sunday. Parisa Khosravi, the senior vice president for CNN International Newsgathering, said in an internal memorandum that she “had a conversation” with Ms. Nasr on Wednesday morning and that “we have decided that she will be leaving the company.” Ms. Nasr, a 20-year veteran of CNN, wrote on Twitter after the cleric died on Sunday, “Sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah … One of Hezbollah’s giants I respect a lot.” Ayatollah Fadlallah routinely denounced Israel and the United States, and supported suicide bombings against Israeli civilians.

British snooker player Alex Higgins found dead at age 61
Alex Higgins, the legendary two-times world snooker champion known as much for his wild lifestyle as his flamboyant play on the green baize, died yesterday aged 61. His skill and speed around the table earned him one of sport's most enduring nicknames: the Hurricane. A world champion by the age of 22, he played a major role in snooker's booming popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, when players were household names. Higgins became one of the fans' favourite players. His second world title win, in 1982 when he beat the Welshman Ray Reardon in an 18-15 final, is one of the sport's best-remembered matches. Belfast-born Higgins regularly courted controversy. After one defeat, he punched a referee. Another time, he headbutted an official, resulting in a fine and a five-tournament ban. It is estimated that he earned, and mostly spent, £3m over 20 years. He said last night: "To people in the game he was a constant source of argument, he was a rebel. But to the wider public he was a breath of fresh air that drew them into the game.

The exact cause of the disaster wasn't known, but the Airbus passenger jet went down in poor weather. Enlarge By Aamir Qureshi, AFP/Getty Images Fire and smoke rise from the wreckage of a passenger plane in the Margalla Hills on the outskirts of Islamabad on Wednesday. ISLAMABAD (AP)  A passenger jet that officials suspect veered off course in monsoon rains and thick clouds crashed into hills overlooking Pakistan 's capital, killing all 152 people on board and scattering body parts and twisted metal far and wide. The Airblue jet's crash Wednesday was the deadliest ever in Pakistan, and just the latest tragedy to jolt a country that has suffered numerous deaths in recent years due to al-Qaeda and Taliban attacks. The plane left the southern city of Karachi at 7:45 a.m. for a two-hour flight to Islamabad and was trying to land when it lost contact with the control tower, said Pervez George, a civil aviation official. The aircraft, an Airbus A321, crashed some nine miles from the airport, scorching a wide stretch of the Margalla Hills, including a section behind Faisal Mosque, one of Islamabad's most prominent landmarks. Twisted metal wreckage hung from trees and lay scattered across the ground. The exact cause of the crash was not immediately clear, and rescue workers were seeking the "black box" flight data recorder amid the wreckage.

Bull fighting banned in Catalonia
Image caption Bullfighting has declined in popularity in Catalonia but fights are still held in Barcelona The parliament of Catalonia has voted to ban bullfighting - the first region of mainland Spain to do so. The vote took place as the result of a petition brought to parliament, signed by 180,000 people who say the practice is barbaric and outdated. Bullfight supporters insist that the corrida, as it is known, is an important tradition to preserve. They also fear the vote could be the first of many in the country. In Wednesday's vote, 68 backed a ban, 55 voted against and nine abstained. Barcelona's main bullring is one of the oldest in Spain, but support for the bullfight has waned. The Barcelona bullring is the only functioning one in Catalonia. The vote was brought to the agenda by activists who argue it is cruel and unacceptable and say most spectators in Catalonia these days are tourists.

But while the official debate is over animal rights, many believe this process is an attempt by nationalist-minded Catalans to mark their difference from the rest of Spain by rejecting one of its best known traditions. Pro-bullfighting groups fear that a ban could spark a wave of similar campaigns across the country.

French woman admits to killing her eight infants
French prosecutors have charged a woman in her 40s with murder, saying she confessed to killing her eight newborn babies and burying their remains. Prosecutors say Dominique Cottrez did not want any more children and did not want to visit a doctor for contraception. Her husband was apparently unaware his wife had given birth eight times and killed the children. French officials describe Cottrez as a heavy-set woman and say it was easy for her to conceal her pregnancies. The new owners of Cottrez's parents' house found two of the corpses buried in the ground in plastic bags. This led police to Cottrez's current house, where they found six more bodies hidden in the garage. A picture taken from the Facebook page allegedly shows Dominique Cottrez, who was charged with the "deliberate homicides of minors under the age of 15". The French nursing assistant has admitted suffocating eight of her newborn babies and stashing their tiny bodies in plastic bags in a quiet village. (Xinhua/AFP Photo) Dominique Cortez, the mother murderer, admitted that she stifled voluntarily eight of her infants and hid their corpses in her ex-house in the northern village of Villers-au-Tertre, local prosecutors said. The mother confessed that she did not want to have babies anymore and refused to see a doctor to get contraception, the prosecutors told local reporters, calling it "a non-standard case given the large number of newborns." The 45-year-old mother of two girls, arrested on charges of deliberating offense against children under 15, is facing a sentence of life imprisonment.

Prosecutors drop assault case against former US VP Gore
Image caption Mr Gore denies any assault took place during a massage by Molly Hagerty Former US Vice-President Al Gore will not face charges over allegations he groped and assaulted a masseuse in his hotel room in Portland, Oregon, in 2006, law enforcement officials say. The authorities say there is "a lack of credible evidence" and the claims do not warrant a criminal prosecution. The decision comes a month after police reopened the investigation. Mr Gore does not dispute that he had a massage from Molly Hagerty, 54, but denies any assault took place. The case, which was closed previously because of a lack of evidence, was reopened in June after Ms Haggerty told the National Enquirer magazine that Mr Gore had tried to assault her. Having reopened the case, prosecutors reportedly chose not to pursue it because Ms Hagerty had refused a polygraph test and appeared to have been paid by the magazine. Mr Gore was in Portland to deliver a speech on climate change when the massage in question took place. Official says masseuse and her attorneys were uncooperative, and witnesses could not remember anything unusual Former vice president Al Gore has been cleared of allegations that he groped and assaulted a masseuse in a Portland hotel room in 2006. After a four-week investigation that included interviews with Gore, the masseuse, her acquaintances and hotel staff, authorities said there was no basis for prosecution. Senior deputy district attorney Don Rees cited "contradictory evidence, conflicting witness statements, credibility issues, lack of forensic evidence and denials by Mr Gore". Rees also said the masseuse and her attorneys were uncooperative, witnesses could not remember anything unusual, and that the masseuse failed a polygraph examination and would not say whether she was paid by a tabloid newspaper for her story.

In a statement released to confirm that the wedding had taken place on Saturday evening, Bill and Hillary Clinton said: "We could not have asked for a more perfect day to celebrate the beginning of their life together, and we are so happy to welcome Marc into our family. "On behalf of the newlyweds, we want to give special thanks to the people of Rhinebeck for welcoming us and to everyone for their well-wishes on this special day." Earlier, actors Ted Danson and his wife Mary Steenburgen told reporters in the town of Rhinebeck, where many of those invited are staying, that they were both excited about attending the ceremony. "I knew her since she was a baby so this is a big moment," Steenburgen said. The wedding was expected to cost between $2m (£1.3m) and $3m (£1.9m), experts told the Associated Press. Shopkeepers, innkeepers, retailers and caterers in Rhinebeck have been sworn to secrecy about the event and inconvenienced local residents have been offered complimentary bottles of wine.

Three children die in Edinburgh house fire
Image caption The dead children have been named as Luca, Austin and Cecilia Riggi Police in Edinburgh are continuing the forensic examination of a flat in which three children were discovered dead. Eight-year-old twins Luca and Austin Riggi and their sister Cecilia, five, were found after a reported gas explosion and fire at the Slateford Road property. Their mother Theresa was hurt when she fell from the townhouse-style building. Police are treating the deaths as suspicious and plan to speak to Mrs Riggi, 46, when she is well enough. It is understood the three youngsters did not die as a result of Wednesday afternoon's suspected explosion and small blaze. Post-mortem examinations are due to be carried out on the children, who were at the centre of a custody battle between their US-born parents, Mrs Riggi and her husband Pasquale. Police have said the results of the post-mortems would help them determine whether to launch a murder inquiry. Det Supt Allan Jones said it was too early to determine the children's cause of death. Mr Jones added: "The family had been in the city for a few weeks and we are keen to speak to anyone who knew them during that time. "We are not in a position to speak to the woman yet and we will take advice from her doctors as to when that can happen. "We would like to do that to get a true background to the events of yesterday and find out exactly what happened within the house." Image caption Mrs Riggi had been reported missing from her Aberdeenshire home last month The children's father has been interviewed by police in Aberdeen, but is said not to be a suspect.

Spreading floods in Pakistan worsen, at least 1600 dead
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption "People say they are not getting help from the army or the government" The worst flooding in Pakistan's history has now affected more than four million people and left at least 1,600 dead, says the UN. While floods in the north-west began to recede, the vast body of water has been moving down the country into new parts of Punjab and menacing Sindh province. All wells have been contaminated and water-borne diseases are spreading, officials say. The number of affected districts in Punjab has reached seven, while 350,000 people have been moved from neighbouring Sindh province, most of which is on high alert, the United Nations said. Manuel Bessler, who heads the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Pakistan, told a news conference in Geneva: "What we are facing now is a major catastrophe." He added: "We are only in the middle of the monsoon season, there is more rain expected. With crops, homes, roads and bridges washed away, the human exodus continued on Thursday as yet more torrential rain fell. Treetops visible In Punjab, known as Pakistan's "breadbasket" for its rich agriculture, more than 1,300 villages have been affected and at least 25,000 homes destroyed, said disaster relief officials in the province. At the scene We witnessed chaotic and frenzied scenes at a camp for about 1,000 displaced people in this north-western town. A single truck arrived at the camp carrying bottled water and biscuits - a private donation from a local politician. From old ladies to children, the people clambered over the truck grabbing what they could in the blazing heat.

US Senate confirms Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan
Enlarge By Jack Gruber, USA TODAY Elena Kagan prepares to testify on the second day of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington on June 29. WASHINGTON  Chief Justice John Roberts will swear in Elena Kagan as the nation's 112th Supreme Court justice on Saturday, making women one-third of the nation's highest court for the first time in history. Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Roberts telephoned Kagan to offer "warm congratulations" Thursday, shortly after the Senate confirmed her. The 63-37 vote was a victory for President Obama, who has doubled the number of women ever named to the Supreme Court with his first two nominees. "I am confident that Elena Kagan will make an outstanding Supreme Court justice," Obama said in Chicago, where he was traveling. "And I am proud, also, of the history we're making with her appointment." When the court reconvenes on the first Monday in October, Kagan will join Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor as the first trio of women serving together as justices. "Long, long overdue," Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said of the breakthrough. DESPITE PARTISAN SWATS: Kagan's path to bench clear Five Republican senators broke ranks with their party to support Kagan's nomination: Richard Lugar of Indiana; Judd Gregg of New Hampshire; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; and Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine. In Kagan, the president has appointed "someone who shares his progressive, elitist vision and is willing to advance it from the bench," warned Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is the Judiciary Committee's top Republican. Kagan will be the first member of the court since the Chief Justice William Rehnquist to arrive without previous experience as a judge.

A ceremony has been held to mark 65 years since the atomic bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Representatives from 75 nations - including the United States, which dropped the bomb - were among thousands who gathered to remember the moment that changed the world. A bell was rung at the precise moment the nuclear bomb 'Little Boy' was dropped by a US plane - just after 0800 on August 6, 1945. Around 140,000 people died, some instantly, others later from the effects of the radiation. (CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon used an appearance at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial ceremony in Japan to advocate for his five-point plan for worldwide nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. August 6 marks the 65th anniversary of the atomic bomb dropped by the United States at the end of World War II on Hiroshima. Another was dropped a few days later on Nagasaki. The bombs devastated both cities and killed more than 200,000 people. "Together, we are on a journey from ground zero to global zero -- a world free of weapons of mass destruction," Ban said. "That is the only sane path to a safer world. For as long as nuclear weapons exist, we will live under a nuclear shadow."

Apple executive leaves company after iPhone 4 antenna issues
The Apple Inc. executive in charge of the iPhone has left the company following a string of stumbles with the device, and what people familiar with the situation said was a falling out with Chief Executive Steve Jobs. Mark Papermaster, Apple's senior vice president for mobile devices, has left the Cupertino, Calif., company, an Apple spokesman said Saturday, declining to provide further details.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Mark Papermaster, the Apple executive in charge of iPhone engineering, has left the company weeks after the "Antennagate" controversy over complaints of poor reception on the company's latest smartphone. Apple spokesman Steve Dowling confirmed Papermaster's exit and said Bob Mansfield is assuming his responsibilities. Dowling declined to provide a reason for the departure of the former IBM senior executive. Apple released the iPhone 4 in June and it was an instant hit with consumers. But reports spread about bad reception when the device was held a certain way, and analysts warned that the company's reputation for quality was under threat. The issue snowballed into a publicity crisis and Apple was forced to call a press conference to tackle the matter. "Mr. Mansfield already manages groups that create many of the key technologies for the iPhone and iPod touch, including the A4 chip, Retina display and touch screens," Dowling said.

Flash floods kill over a hundred in India, 500 missing
CHOGLUMSAR (Leh): Rescue workers struggled through piles of mud and slush looking for over 500 people missing in the Friday's devastating cloudburst that flattened villages and snapped power and communication links even as the death toll in the tragedy on Sunday mounted to 145.The once picturesque landscape has turned into a disaster zone, with tossed up vehicles lying scattered and mounds of silt and slush burying houses made of mud called 'gomfa' and shops.Walking on the layers of unstable mud in one of the worst-hit Choglusmar village, you could find the high tension wires hanging right next to you.Rescuers waded through knee-deep mud to extricate trapped people. Jawans of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Army and General Reserve Engineer Force (GREF) ploughed through the silt and boulders with earth movers, cranes and other machines, tourists were seen giving a helping hand.The death toll has climbed to 145 while over 500 were still to be accounted for after the cloudburst and flash floods, official sources said.Both the ITBP and the Army have set up various camps to look after hundreds of injured. The ITBP had also set up community kitchens along the roads which are feeding the homeless.The biggest roadblock that rescue workers are facing is communication breakdown as the BSNL office was severely damaged in the deluge. "The major problem is due to the communication breakdown. If communication is restored it will help in co-ordination of rescue operations in a better way," Pashi Tsetan, deputy director with the development wing of the local administration, said.The district hospital building had been inundated by the swirling waters forcing the administration to move to an under-construction building.Hundreds of people with bandages crowd the building. Doctors say many of the injured were swept away by the deluge for considerable distances before being rescued.The bodies of two French nationals identified as Augariwelus and Hellot were retrieved from under the debris, the sources said.Meanwhile, Army on Sunday said 33 soldiers were washed away in flash floods in Shyok river of Ladakh region near Siachen on Friday.The Army has sought the help of Pakistani authorities to trace the personnel who were on duty on the Line of Control as they fear that they might have been swept away towards Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in the deluge.A group of about 45 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel have also joined the rescue efforts in Leh. The NDRF team has brought with them high-tech equipment to gear up rescue operations. The effort of all agencies is to rescue the maximum number of people," said ITBP DIG P K Dhasmana who is leading hundreds of rescuers.As many as 1,314 passengers, mostly Indian and foreign tourists, were airlifted from Leh and brought to Delhi, aviation ministry sources said.JET airways and Air India operated four flights each and Kingfisher three to carry medical and other relief material, doctrors and para medics to help affected people in Leh, they said.Three IL-76 and four AN-32 aircraft carrying relief material reached Leh on Sunday morning. "We have recovered 145 bodies so far while the number of missing is around 500," an official said, adding the toll may go up.ITBP is helping plug the breaches to make NH-1A between Srinagar-Kargil and Kargil-Leh functionalFaced with an acute shortage of clean drinking water, the ITBP has dispatched tankers containing drinking water to the affected areas, Deepak Pandey spokesperson for the border guarding force said.The force has also established a medical camp in Saboo village, which is located above Chuglumsar village, Pandey said.Bodies of eleven persons were on Sunday flown in an IAF plane to Udhampur in Jammu region from where they were sent to Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan, police said. NEW DELHI: Amid the mounting death and debris of Choglamsar village -- located 5 km from Leh and a bustling settlement of Ladakhis and Tibetan refugees -- that has borne the major burnt in the massive mudslide sparked by Friday's cloudburst, comes stories of miraculous escapes bordering on divine intervention.According to sources in Leh that ToI was able to contact through defence sources, the wife of an Indo-Tibet Border Police officer was found alive after being swept away by the slithering mass of mud. She was found under the furniture that saved her from being smothered.Sources said the situation could have been worse but for the rumbling of the slithering mass of mud -- akin to cold lava -- and screams of people warning people in the defence settlements dotting the plains. Many in the defence establishment managed to escape nature's wrath since the slithering mass of mud did not gush like a stream of water, and the preceding rumbling gave some precious time to the people in the lower reaches to beat an hasty retreat.Sources expected the Leh-Manali road to be opened in a couple of days as heavy earth-moving equipment, called JCB bythe defence establishment, have been pressed into service.

Mia Farrow, Carole White testify in Charles Taylor's war crimes trial
She told the court at The Hague that supermodel Naomi Campbell claimed in1997 to have been given a large diamond by Mr. Taylor after a dinner party hosted by Nelson Mandela. However, Farrow's testimony contradicts Campbell's own evidence given last week. The court questioned actress Mia Farrow about the events surrounding a dinner party hosted by Nelson Mandela in 1997. The morning after the party, she said, fellow guest Naomi Campbell told her that Charles Taylor had sent her a diamond in the night. "She (Naomi Campbell) said that in the night she had been awakened, some men were knocking at the door, and they had been sent by Charles Taylor, and they had given her a huge diamond," Mia Farrow said. She told the court that Mr. Taylor had promised Campbell the diamonds over dinner. Both White and Farrow contradicted what Naomi Campbell told the court last week. She said she had been given what she called "a few dirty pebbles" in the middle of the night. And she stopped short of saying she had known they were from Mr. Taylor. They say the gift given to Campbell links him to these so-called "blood diamonds".

Former US Senator Ted Stevens among five killed in Alaska plane crash
(CBS) A plane carrying former Sen. Ted Stevens and ex-NASA chief Sean O'Keefe crashed into a remote mountainside in Alaska, killing the longtime senator and at least four others, authorities said Tuesday.O'Keefe and his teenage son Kevin O'Keefe survived the crash with broken bones and other injuries, former NASA spokesman Glenn Malone said. The O'Keefes spent Monday night on the mountain with several volunteers who discovered the wreckage and tended to the injured until rescuers arrived Tuesday morning.With its rugged terrain and foggy weather, Alaska accounts for 22 percent of all small plane crashes nationwide, according to National Transportation and Safety Board data from 2004, the latest year available,reports from Los Angeles.reports that the flag flying above the U.S. Capitol was lowered Tuesday evening to half-staff.Stevens and O'Keefe are longtime fishing buddies who had been planning a trip near where the float plane crashed.By Wednesday evening, officials said in a statement they had identified all nine passengers on the plane and notified the victims' next of kin.The other passengers who died with Stevens were Theron "Terry" Smith, 62 and the plane's pilot of Eagle River, Alaska; William "Bill" Phillips Sr.; Dana Tindall, 48 of Anchorage, Alaska; and Corey Tindall, 16 of Anchorage, Alaska.The four survivors are William "Willy" Phillips Jr., 13; Sean O'Keefe, 54; Kevin O'Keefe; and Jim Morhard of Alexandria, Va. They were taken to an Anchorage hospital with varying degrees of injuries, officials said.During a Tuesday evening press conference in Anchorage, NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman told reporters that Smith, the pilot, had recorded about 29,000 hours of flight time when he last had a physical in December 2009. Hersman also said the plane he was flying was manufactured in 1957 but had undergone a mechanical overhaul in 2005.The crash was a stunning event in a state whereduring his 40 years in the Senate, earning a reputation as a tireless advocate for projects that brought millions of federal dollars to the state. "We have lost a tremendous husband and father and grandfather," the Stevens family said in a statement. He was a guiding light through Statehood and the development of the 49th State. Now that light is gone but the warmth and radiance of his life and his work will shine forever in the last frontier. His legacy is the 49th star on the American flag. "His entire life was dedicated to public service from his days as a pilot in World War II to his four decades of service in the United States Senate. "The plane crashed into a brush- and rock-covered mountainside sometime Monday night, authorities said. Volunteer pilots were dispatched to the area around 7 p.m. local time after the plane was found to be overdue at its destination, and they came upon the wreckage about a half hour later.The weather soon took a turn for the worse, with heavy fog, clouds and rain blanketing the area and making it impossible for rescuers to arrive until after daybreak Tuesday.

Wikinews obtains new details on UK prisoner's murder
The Prison Officers' Association has called for an investigation into the murder of an inmate at Grendon prison, claiming that government cuts are jeopardising the Buckinghamshire jail's ability to treat some of the penal system's most difficult prisoners. It emerged today that Robert Coello, a 44-year-old former bus driver who was serving a sentence for sexually assaulting a minor, died on Sunday night after being attacked in his cell by a fellow inmate. It is thought to be the first murder in Grendon's 48-year history. The jail, which was opened in 1962 as an experimental psychiatric prison to treat prisoners with antisocial personality disorders, houses a population which includes murderers and sex offenders. The prison is run as a "therapeutic community" which aims "to help prisoners develop more positive relationships, to change how they relate to others and to reduce their risk of reoffending". Colin Moses, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, said budget cuts may have affected the vetting system that ensures only those prisoners best suited to Grendon are allowed in. "Grendon has been a very well run prison," he said. "It has had an excellent record of dealing with some of the most difficult prisoners in very difficult circumstances. [But] staff there are concerned about the kind of people who are now being put into Grendon.

US food regulators recall 380 million eggs after salmonella outbreak
Government officials say that the number of people sickened by an outbreak of salmonella poisoning from eggs is likely to rise because officials fear that many of the contaminated eggs are still in peoples' refigerators. The salmonella outbreak has triggered a massive recall of eggs and sickened about 2,000 people, and many more cases are expected to be reported. "With the fact that contaminated eggs could still be in consumers' refrigerators, this outbreak could really be one of the largest linked to eggs that we've seen in 20 years," Caroline Smith DeWall of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said. Play The number of recalled eggs by an Iowa Farm has skyrocketed to 380 million eggs, up from 228 million eggs on Wednesday. The recall includes eggs that were packed right up until two days ago. "There are preventative measures that woulld have been in place that could have prevented this if they had been in place more fully," said Sherri McGarry of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. McCarry said that "one area we are closely looking at and examining" is whether rodents had gotten into the chicken houses. Rodents, she said, "tend to run in the feed troughs.... if they're not well maintained. The eggs that are believed to be tainted were sold under the following brand names: Lucerne, Mountain Dairy, Sunshine, Hillandale, Trafficanda, Albertson, Farm Fresh, Shoreland, James Farms, Glenview, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma's, Lund, Dutch Farms, Kemps and Pacific Coast. The Julian dates range from 136 to 229 with plant numbers 1026, 1413, 1942 and 1946.

Seven killed in Chinese bombing
SHANGHAI — An explosion killed 7 people and wounded 14 others on Thursday in China’s restive far western region of Xinjiang, the site of deadly ethnic riots last year. The blast took place about 10:30 a.m. when an electric three-wheeled vehicle exploded on a bridge on the outskirts of Aksu, a city in northwestern Xinjiang, according to China’s state-run news agency, Xinhua. Most of those wounded were ethnic minorities. Photo Xinhua said a man was detained at the scene. Hou Hanmin, a spokeswoman for the government of Xinjiang, said the “name and age of the male suspect are unknown yet.” Aksu is on China’s fabled Silk Road, about 404 miles from Urumqi, the region’s capital, and about 40 miles from China’s border with Kyrgyzstan. The rioting left 197 people dead and more than 1,700 injured, most of them Han, according to the government. "Police say it was an intentional act because the suspect was carrying explosive devices,'' Hou Hanmin, a spokeswoman for the Xinjiang government, said. Authorities said that the assailant was injured in the explosion and captured immediately, though they did not say whether the suspect was a man or a woman. Intentions unclear Melissa Chan, Al Jazeera's correspondent in the regional capital, Urumqi, said: "It could well have been that this small vehicle was carrying some flammable liquid and that it could have been an accident. "But what the officials made very clear is that was intentional and that this was not an accident. "The other thing that we are getting is that all of the dead and injured are ethnic minorities. "So it is unclear at the moment what the intentions were." Xinjiang has suffered ethnic conflict and separatist violence in the past.

Race to save Chilean miners trapped underground from spiralling into depression continues
33 men entombed in collapsed San Jose mine are given just 30 seconds each to speak to their wives, children and parents The 33 Chilean miners trapped deep underground have spoken for the first time to family members waiting for them on the surface. The brief phone conversations late yesterday brought a measure of reassurance to families who have grown increasingly worried about the ability of the men to survive the estimated three months of the rescue operation. Engineers at the mine in Chile's Atacama desert are awaiting for drilling parts from Germany to begin the initial digging of what is expected to be the main rescue shaft. "The families have had the chance to communicate by telephone with them, so of course there have been moments of great emotion," said Ximena Matas, the governor of the Atacama region. She said the families "listened with great interest and they both felt and realised that the men are well. This has been a very important moment, which no doubt strengthens their [the miners'] morale". Family members received the first of what are intended to be daily phone calls in a cabin set up alongside one of the three boreholes now connecting the miners with the surface. Portions of the conversations were made public, including the promise by miner Esteban Rojas that he would marry his girlfriend of 25 years upon his rescue from the collapsed tunnel. As the phone connection is still precarious, family members were given just 20-30 seconds to say hello and send a short message to their loved one. "I could hear him fine," said Jessica Cortes, who spoke to her husband Victor Zamora. "He is aware that the rescue is not going to happen today, that it will take some time. He asked us to stay calm as everything is going to be OK. "He sounded relaxed and since it was so short I didn't manage to ask anything.

No oil spillage after platform explodes in the Gulf of Mexico
HOUSTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said on Thursday afternoon that production from a burning oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut. Jindal said operator Mariner Energy's ME.N senior officials told Louisiana officials the flow of oil from the sea floor had been stopped. The fire seen on the platform was from flammable material in storage on the platform. HOUSTON, Sept 2 The U.S. Coast Guard said a 1-nautical-mile-by-100-foot (1.85-km-by-30.5-meter) oil sheen had been reported at the site of a Mariner Energy ME.N platform in the Gulf of Mexico that was on fire Thursday after a morning explosion. The fire on board the platform located 90 miles (145 km) south of the Louisiana coast was contained as of 12 noon CDT (1700 GMT) but had not been put out, the Coast Guard said. An oil platform exploded and burned off the Louisiana coast Thursday, the second such disaster n the Gulf of Mexico in less than five months. The Coast Guard initially reported that an oil sheen a mile long and 100 feet wide had begun to spread from the site of the blast, about 200 miles west of the source of BP's massive spill. The company that owns the platform, Houston-based Mariner Energy, did not know what caused the fire. Mariner Energy's Patrick Cassidy said he considered the incident a fire, not an explosion. "The platform is still intact and it was just a small portion of the platform that appears to be burned," he said.

Basque separatist group ETA declares ceasefire
The Spanish government on Monday rejected a new ceasefire announcement by the separatist group ETA and ruled out negotiations on an independent Basque homeland, saying the militants have been decimated by arrests and are desperate to regroup and rearm. A boy walks past ETA graffiti in Mondragon, Spain on Monday. Basque rebels ETA have decided to no longer carry out armed attacks, newspaper Gara said on its website on Sunday. ((Vincent West/Reuters)) Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the ETA cannot be trusted after shattering a 2006 truce with a deadly car bombing. He said its statement Sunday by three hooded militants speaking in a video falls short of what Basque society and other Spaniards demand: that ETA renounce violence for good. "The word truce, as the idea of a limited peace to open a process of dialogue, is dead," Perez Rubalcaba, adding that Spain will be as tough as ever against ETA. "The Interior Ministry will keep its anti-terrorism policy intact, absolutely intact. We are not going to change that policy one bit, not a single comma," he told Spanish National Television. ETA has killed more than 825 people as it fought for an independent homeland in parts of northern Spain and southwestern France since the late 1960s. Its last deadly attack in Spain was in July 2009, when it killed two policemen with a car bomb. Nearly 240 of its members have been arrested since 2008. It is considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. Besides silence on whether the ETA will surrender its weapons, it did not say if the truce was open-ended and permanent, like the one declared in 2006 and which led to talks with the government, or whether it would halt other activities like extorting money from business leaders or recruiting members.

He told ITV in March his father was a "huge hero figure for me" who had a great sense of optimism. It is understood the prime minister will remain in France overnight.

Scottish FA apologise after fans boo Liechtenstein national anthem
Scotland fans booed during the Liechtenstein national anthem The Scottish Football Association has hit out at the "disgraceful" booing of the Liechtenstein national anthem. A section of Scotland fans jeered the anthem - which has the same tune as God Save The Queen - before their side's 2-1 victory in the Euro 2012 qualifier. SFA acting chief executive George Peat said he was "embarrassed" by the booing at Hampden on Tuesday. "I apologise unreservedly to our visitors for the crass reaction to their anthem," said Peat. MY SPORT: DEBATE "The Scotland fans have worked hard to earn their reputation throughout the world as fun-loving and respectful followers of football," he added. "Last night, those who chose to boo our opponents' anthem only served to tarnish that reputation." Scotland's victory, coupled with Lithuania's 1-0 win away to the Czech Republic, sees the Scots top Group I with four points from their opening two games. The Liechtenstein anthem, which has the same tune as God Save The Queen, was met with audible derision by some members of the Scotland support ahead of last night's match at Hampden Park, which Craig Levein's men won 2-1 courtesy of Stephen McManus' 97th-minute header. Peat said: "I was embarrassed and extremely disappointed by the disgraceful behaviour of some of our supporters during the Liechtenstein national anthem at Hampden Park last night. "Last night, those who chose to boo our opponents' anthem only served to tarnish that reputation.

Pastor of Florida church cancels plans to burn Qur'an, later reconsiders
Donald Trump is offering to buy out the major investor in the New York City mosque site near the World Trade Center site. Enlarge By Paul J. Richards, AFP/Getty Images Imam Muhammad Musri, right, from the Islamic Society of Central Florida, said Thursday at a news conference in Gainesville, Fla., that Pastor Terry Jones, left, will cancel the planned burning of the Quran. @FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER @FAITH_REASON ON TWITTER GAINESVILLE, Fla.  A Florida pastor who has threatened to burn Qurans on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks issued new demands Friday. Paul, gave New York Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf two hours Friday afternoon to answer questions about whether he plans to relocate the mosque and cultural center planned near Ground Zero. Jones said at a hastily called press conference: "This challenge goes to the imam in New York. We would like to make an announcement to give a challenge to the imam in New York." Paul, who heads the Global Peace Initiative, an evangelical group based in Houston, said "there is a confusion going on. We want to clear that confusion to find out if he has agreed to move the mosque from Ground Zero." AFGHANS: 11 injured in anti-Quran-burning protests POLL: Do you link Quran burning, Ground Zero mosque? 9/11: Share your story, see photos, videos The men said they were giving the New York imam two hours, from about 1:20 p.m. to about 3:20 p.m, to call, and gave out two phone numbers. They did not address what they might do if he does not call or declines to move the planned mosque. Around 3:30 p.m. Friday, Jones and Paul told news media camped in a field about 100 yards from the church that they had not heard from the imam in New York. "The last two days I have been in much prayer with Pastor Terry Jones," Paul said.

BP report into Gulf of Mexico disaster lays blame on other contractors
BP rolled out the results Wednesday of a four-month internal investigation into the causes of the April 20 blowout of its Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, spreading blame among its contractors and giving a glimpse of the defenses it might deploy in public and in court. The much-anticipated report asserted that a "complex and interlinked series" of failures - of equipment, engineering and judgment - led to the surge of oil and gas that exploded on the deck of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, killing 11 people, sinking the rig and triggering the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The report was written by a team of 50 internal and external experts led by the company's head of safety and operations, Mark Bly, and the rollout Wednesday morning at a hotel in downtown Washington was labeled a "technical briefing." But the document inevitably carries a heavy public relations element as well as legal and financial implications for BP. It arrives as the Justice Department is weighing whether to bring charges of criminal negligence against BP that could sharply increase the cost of the spill for the London-based oil giant and provide fodder for private lawsuits. In addition, there is legislation in Congress that would effectively strip BP of the right to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. The company is haggling with the Obama administration over what pieces of collateral to offer while it is financing the $20 billion escrow fund that will be used to pay claims. And BP's main partner in the well, Anadarko Petroleum, has declared that it won't pay its share of the cleanup costs and claims because it views BP's well design and actions as reckless. The BP report makes the case for "shared responsibility," saying that "no single factor" caused the blowout. The investigation found fault with the recipe Halliburton used in its cement, with the flaps on a Weatherford International barrier device known as a float collar, and with the condition of hydraulic lines and batteries that might have sapped power from the blowout preventer made by Cameron International and operated by Transocean, making it impossible to clamp and cut through steel piping. And Bly said BP needs to reexamine the way it oversees work by its contractors.

Up to ten reported dead, 50 injured after pipeline blast in Iran
TEHRAN (Reuters) - Up to 10 Iranian workers died on Saturday in hospital after being badly burnt in an explosion in a gas pipeline, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. The pipeline transporting gas from the Khangiran refinery in Sarakhs to the city of Mashhad in Iran's northeastern province of Khorasan-e Razavi exploded on Friday when it was accidentally struck by an excavating machine, state media reported. "About nine to 10 people were killed in the Sarakhs pipeline blast," Alireza Gharibi, director of Iran Gas Engineering and Development Company, told the semi-official Fars news agency. Iran's state television said 50 people also were injured. The explosion set off a fire covering 2 sq km (.77 sq mile) but it was brought under control, the official IRNA news agency reported. Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Javad Oji told Fars that gas transfer through the damaged Sarakhs-Mashhad pipeline will be resumed within the next 24-to-36 hours. Iran is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and also sits on the world's second largest natural gas reserves and the country's economy is heavily dependent on oil and gas revenues. Accidental rupture leaves 10 workers dead and 20 injured, as firefighters bring blaze under control after three hours. The fire caused by the accident raged for three hours before firefighters brought the blaze under control A gas pipeline explosion has killed 10 people and injured more than 20 in the city of Mashhad, northeastern Iran. The accident on Friday, set off when an earth-moving machine struck a local pipeline, ignited a large blaze in the area, the official ISNA news agency reported on Saturday. Ali Reza Gharibi, the director of the National Iranian Gas Engineering and Development Company, said the machine lost balance in the mountainous terrain before falling onto the pipeline.

Gunman shoots doctor, then kills mother and self at Maryland hospital
A man who became distraught as he was being briefed on his mother’s condition by a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital here pulled a gun and shot the doctor on Thursday, then killed his mother and himself in her room at the medical center, the police said. The doctor, who was wounded in the abdomen, was expected to survive. He was identified by colleagues as Dr. David B. Cohen, an orthopedic surgeon. The gunman, Paul W. Pardus, 50, had been listening to the surgeon around midday when he “became emotionally distraught and reacted ... and was overwhelmed by the news of his mother’s condition,” Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld III of the Baltimore police said. Mr. Pardus pulled a semiautomatic gun from his waistband and shot the doctor once, the commissioner said. He then holed up in the room in a standoff of more than two hours that led the authorities to lock down a small section of the building while allowing the rest of the sprawling medical complex to remain open. BALTIMORE (CBS/AP) Baltimore police say a lone gunman shot a doctor on the eighth floor of a Johns Hopkins Hospital building in Baltimore, was believed to have barricaded himself in a relative's hospital room. Parts of the Nelson Building, the main tower at Johns Hopkins, was put on lockdown around 11:15 a.m. Thursday, and other sections of the East Baltimore hospital campus were evacuated, after reports of shots being fired, according to The Baltimore Sun. A nurse who worked on the floor where the injured doctor was shot told the paper that the gunman was unhappy about the way his mother was being treated and had threatened to jump out of a window when the shooting occurred. "I started running," The nurse told the Sun. Baltimore police said they were setting up a tactical operation to deal with a gunman who is holed up on the eighth floor.

Facebook Places launches in UK
The service, which allows users to check-in at restaurants, bars and shops, was launched in the US last month. Many UK users will be able to access the service today and it will roll-out to everyone in the UK over the next couple of days. Facebook Places lets users share their location in a similar fashion to popular location-based social networks such as Foursquare and Gowalla. People using the tool can see if their friends are near them at any time based on whether they have chosen to check-into their current location. Martin McNulty, general manager of Forward 3D, a search marketing specialist, said: “Facebook Places is likely to experience a slow rate of adoption among UK audiences on its launch as people try to uncover its practical value. However, as early technology adopters begin experimenting with the technology and showing others how it can be used, its growth rate is sure to rapidly increase. "Although many of the older generation are likely to be sceptical at first about the safety aspects of announcing your location to the digital world, younger and more experimental users, will be keen to get to grips with this new tool and are less likely to let fear stand in their way.” Stuart Eccles, managing partner of Made by Many, a digital consultancy, agreed saying: “Initially Facebook Places is likely to only gain a small proportion of users but then a small proportion of Facebook users is still a lot of people. However, when it starts working with large chains and local businesses to run promotions for regular customers, we’ll start to see it enter the mainstream. Michael Sharon, the product manager of Facebook places, said: “Our products are modelled on how people are already using the site… We realised people were already posting where they were and who they were with every day.” Talking at a UK press conference this morning, he said that the company had three distinct goals for Places.

'Poetry lost': rude rhyme rediscovered, attributed to John Milton
Image caption Milton was known for his political and religious poems A bawdy poem attributed to Paradise Lost author John Milton has been discovered by academics at Oxford University. However experts are unsure of its authenticity as the hand-written ditty is in a style unlike Milton's own. It is thought the poem may have been attributed to Milton by a jealous rival to bring scandal upon him. Dr Jennifer Batt, who discovered the poem, said: "To see the name of John Milton, the great religious and political polemicist, attached to such a bawdy epigram, is extremely surprising to say the least." AN EXTEMPORE UPON A FAGGOT Have you not in a Chimney seen A Faggot which is moist and green How coyly it receives the Heat And at both ends do's weep and sweat? So fares it with a tender Maid When first upon her Back she's laid But like dry Wood th' experienced Dame Cracks and rejoices in the Flame "The poem is so out of tune with the rest of his work, that if the attribution is correct, it would prompt a major revision of our ideas about Milton. "It is likely that Milton's name was used as an attribution to bring scandal upon the poet, perhaps by a jealous contemporary," she added. The handwritten poem appears to have been signed by Milton but is written in a style utterly unlike his own, and does not tally with his status as an epic poet, polemicist and scholarly man of letters.

Man released following bomb-scare forced flight diversion, warning a possible hoax
Police detain one person after tip that Pakistan-bound aircraft travelling from Canada could have explosives aboard. The plane landed at Arlanda airport and was parked isolated from other aircraft and buildings [AFP] Swedish police have detained one person on suspicion of preparing aircraft sabotage after a Pakistan International Airlines plane was diverted to Stockholm due to a bomb alert. Police detained the suspect, described as a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, as he was evacuated from the aircraft on Saturday along with other passengers in the Swedish capital. The Pakistan-bound plane was travelling from Toronto, Canada, with 273 passengers when its pilot made an emergency landing in Sweden following a tip that a passenger was carrying explosives. "We're searching the plane with bomb technicians to see if there is something we can find but so far we haven't found anything, neither on the plane nor on the man," Stefan Radman, the police chief of operations, said. Alert from Canada  Janne Hedlund, an official with the Stockholm police, said the plane was diverted after a woman called Canadian police, saying a man on board had explosives with him. "The aircraft started in Toronto at 05:15 local time and when the aircraft was in Swedish territory, a woman called the Canadian police and said that this man could probably have a bomb on board the aircraft," he said. "The aircraft is evacuated and the suspect is under control by the police authorities in Arlanda.

Southwest Airlines to purchase AirTran Airways for US$1.4 billion
(CNN) -- Fares and fees. They're what air travelers watch, and Southwest Airlines' plan to acquire fellow low-fare airline AirTran has consumers and industry watchers buzzing about how the planned merger will affect the price of travel. AirTran will be absorbed by Southwest and adopt Southwest's policies, according to details of the $1.4 billion deal announced Monday. "We have open seating, we have no plans to change that. We have single-class service, we have no plans to change that," said Gary Kelly, Southwest's chairman of the board, president and CEO. "It's good news for AirTran passengers ... in general because Southwest has better service than AirTran and lower fees," said George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com. Consumer advocate and HLN money expert Clark Howard sees the acquisition as a positive development for air travelers nationwide. "It's so good for the flying public. This is an opportunity for a discounter to have the kind of heft and national reach of the full-fare airlines," Howard said. While it's unlikely the acquisition will lead to higher fares nationwide, he expects other airlines, such as American Airlines and USAirways, to join in the wave of airline mergers that started several years ago. "But the thing is, fares can only go up so high before passengers say 'no thank you.'

WikiLeaks releases Iraq War logs
On Dec. 22, 2006, American military officials in Baghdad issued a secret warning: The Shiite militia commander who had orchestrated the kidnapping of officials from Iraq’s Ministry of Higher Education was now hatching plans to take American soldiers hostage. What made the warning especially worrying were intelligence reports saying that the Iraqi militant, Azhar al-Dulaimi, had been trained by the Middle East’s masters of the dark arts of paramilitary operations: the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran and Hezbollah, its Lebanese ally. “Dulaymi reportedly obtained his training from Hizballah operatives near Qum, Iran, who were under the supervision of Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC-QF) officers in July 2006,” the report noted, using alternative spellings of the principals involved. Read the Document » Five months later, Mr. Dulaimi was tracked down and killed in an American raid in the sprawling Shiite enclave of Sadr City in Baghdad — but not before four American soldiers had been abducted from an Iraqi headquarters in Karbala and executed in an operation that American military officials say literally bore Mr. Dulaimi’s fingerprints. Scores of documents made public by WikiLeaks, which has disclosed classified information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, provide a ground-level look — at least as seen by American units in the field and the United States’ military intelligence — at the shadow war between the United States and Iraqi militias backed by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. During the administration of President George W. Bush, critics charged that the White House had exaggerated Iran’s role to deflect criticism of its handling of the war and build support for a tough policy toward Iran, including the possibility of military action. But the field reports disclosed by WikiLeaks, which were never intended to be made public, underscore the seriousness with which Iran’s role has been seen by the American military. The political struggle between the United States and Iran to influence events in Iraq still continues as Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has sought to assemble a coalition — that would include the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr — that will allow him to remain in power. Citing the testimony of detainees, a captured militant’s diary and numerous uncovered weapons caches, among other intelligence, the field reports recount Iran’s role in providing Iraqi militia fighters with rockets, magnetic bombs that can be attached to the underside of cars, “explosively formed penetrators,” or E.F.P.’s, which are the most lethal type of roadside bomb in Iraq, and other weapons.

Pentagon unable to explain 'mystery missile' video
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The vapour trail was seen not far off the coast of Los Angeles Pentagon officials say they cannot explain reports of a missile launch off the coast of California on Monday. A CBS News helicopter captured what looked like the vapour trail of a missile rising from the water about 35 miles (56 km) offshore. Some physicists said the trail was left by an aeroplane, and that on a clear day the vapour created an illusion making it appear to rise vertically. The Pentagon does not consider the incident a threat. "Right now all indications are that it was not [defence department] involvement in this launch" Pentagon spokesman Col David Lapan said. We're doing everything we can to try to figure out if anybody has any knowledge of what this event may have been." Under normal circumstances, the launch of a US missile would require several different authorisations and notifications, but none are evident. It is unclear if the suspected missile was launched from land or sea. Physicist Michio Kaku of the City University of New York said a frame-by-frame analysis of the video revealed the trail was created by an aeroplane. He told CNN on Wednesday the object leaving the trail was travelling at a constant velocity and deviating in its direction, while rockets accelerate as they leave the ground and move in a straight line. One expert says he has an answer for a video that appears to show anoff the Southern California coast - there was no missile.John Pike of the security analyst group globalsecurity.org said the video shot by a news helicopter owned by KCBS is an optical illusion.Pike said the video is of an airplane heading toward the camera and the contrail is illuminated by the setting sun. He said the object can't be a rocket because it appeared to alter its course.Pentagon officials were stumped by the event, saying no one within the Department of Defense has been able to explain the contrail or where it came from.The FAA told CBS News that they ran radar replays of a large area west of Los Angeles based on media reports of the location of a possible missile launch, but they did not reveal any fast moving unidentified targets in that area. Launches are conducted from vessels and platforms on an ocean range west of Point Mugu.The North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, issued a statement jointly with the U.S. Northern Command, or NORTHCOM, saying that the contrail was not the result of a foreign military launching a missile.

Aung San Suu Kyi release orders 'signed'
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained for 15 of the past 21 years Reports from Burma say military authorities have signed an order authorising the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. But hopes she would be freed on Friday were dashed: there has been no official confirmation of a release order. A leader of her NLD party told 2,000 supporters gathered at its headquarters to go home and return on Saturday. Ms Suu Kyi has been detained for 15 of the past 21 years, and her house arrest term expires on Saturday. There has been increased police activity outside her house in Rangoon, Burma's largest city, but no formal statement from military officials. However, Ms Suu Kyi is not expected to accept a conditional release if it excludes her from political activity. The 65-year-old was originally due to be released last year, but a case involving an American who swam across Inya Lake to her home, claiming he was on a mission to save her, prompted the latest 18-month detention. At the scene All day rumours have circulated that Aung Sang Suu Kyi could soon be free, and all day the crowds outside the offices of the NLD have grown. The building is constantly watched by government intelligence agents, yet still they came, defiantly wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with the face of their icon. Then the word came that the release would not after all be today, but perhaps tomorrow, and still no official statement from the military government. He says a number of sources inside Burma have told the BBC that documents authorising Ms Suu Kyi's release have been signed.

Iraqi government approves power-sharing deal eight months after elections
Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- After eight months of bickering and political paralysis, Iraqi leaders were thought to have finally reached a power-sharing agreement Thursday for a new government, but that deal appeared to fall apart late in the day as members of the Sunni-backed Iraqiya List walked out of the parliamentary session. Jalal Talabani, sworn in late Thursday for a second term as president, delegated Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to form a government within 30 days, as mandated by the constitution. Quarreling that has typified Iraq's gridlock re-emerged during the parliamentary session, from which most members of the Sunni-backed Iraqiya bloc walked out saying that the other political blocs were not adhering to their promise to vote on the tentative power-sharing agreement, which had been reached late Wednesday. The Iraqiya List had wanted parliament to vote on that agreement before voting for a president in order to ensure guarantees that had been promised to the Sunnis were in fact delivered. In the past, politicians have made promises to Sunnis that have not materialized, resulting in a widespread lack of trust. Politicians had cobbled out a compromise Wednesday that would have left Maliki in power and created a powerful new office that was expected to be headed by his rival, former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, lawmakers said Thursday. Under the proposed deal, the three major governmental positions were to have been filled by three members of the country's largest ethnic groups -- the Shiites, the Kurds and the Sunni Arabs. But Sunnis did not consider Nujaifi to be adequate representation, and many members of the Iraqiya bloc walked out when parliament didn't accept its demand for a vote on the actual power-sharing agreement.

Somali piracy: Kenyan navy kills three, Chinese ship hijacked, British couple freed
(CNN) -- It has been just over one year since retired couple Paul and Rachel Chandler were snatched from their yacht by pirates while sailing from the Seychelles towards Tanzania. They were experienced sailors and had been at sea for the best part of three years, as documented in blogs sent from their 38-foot yacht, the Lynn Rival. "Off we go again," reads one of their earliest entries from April 2006. "Afloat at last," they declared the following May, noting that "As ever, all our pre-launching tasks have taken longer than expected. The main task was a much needed engine overhaul. After 27 years it needed a good de-rust and re-paint." An online map on the blog charts the couple's progress through the Gulf of Aden in 2008, including a stop to visit Asmara, the capital of Eritrea where they noted: "We drank cappucinos and ate seafood pasta and pizza with real prosciutto, though the salami left something to be desired and the local wine is very rough." Their trip continued across the Arabian Sea and down the coast of India, south to the Maldives then onto the Seychelles where Paul, a former civil engineer and his wife of almost 30 years, Rachel, spent Easter. Two days later, they were kidnapped by armed gunmen who demanded a ransom of $7 million which the British government refused to pay in line with long-standing policy. Chandler said he and his wife were taken off the yacht and were held on a container ship called the Kota Wajah.

Beijing, China (CNN) -- Four suspects have been detained in a China high-rise fire that killed 53 people, state media said Tuesday. Monday's fire has hospitalized at least 70 other people, including 17 who were seriously injured, officials said. A preliminary investigation indicated that unqualified welders caused the fire, the Xinhua news agency said. Witnesses said a scaffolding caught fire, and flames then spread to the building. "The fire became so big because the scaffolding contained a great amount of flammable materials," Zhu Zhixiang, a Shanghai firefighting official told state broadcaster CCTV. "I can smell the smoke and police have pushed onlookers farther away," said Peijin Chen, a freelance photographer who lives across the street from the building.
