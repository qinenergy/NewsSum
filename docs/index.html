<p> The man, now 54, lives in Missouri. The complaint also said that two teens identified Sohngen as having paid to have sexual contact with them. Civil cases involving allegations of child sex tourism are rare, and the jury's verdict holds the man accountable for violating child sex tourism and child sex trafficking laws. The case was handled in Minnesota because Vang and the man both lived here at the time. "My body was ruined. How could this happen?" The founder of a New York City music school for children was arrested this morning on federal charges alleging he had sex with teen girls and tried to arrange sexual contact with girls as young as 8 years old, authorities said. Sohngen is due to appear today in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan for an initial hearing. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. The criminal complaint alleges he had sexual contact with a 15-year-old girl and a 17-year-old girl and tried to purchase sexual encounters with others ages 8 to 17. Updated: May 12, 2017 - 4:15 PM

- A federal jury has awarded a woman nearly $1 million in a case against a former Minnesota man who she says traveled to her native Laos and sexually assaulted her when she was 14 years old. Vang became pregnant and was bound to the man through a traditional Hmong marriage. A search of the pimp’s phone allegedly revealed contact information for Sohngen. It’s not immediately clear whether he has a defense attorney representing him yet. “Sohngen appears to have exchanged text messages with an individual for the purpose of purchasing commercial sex acts with minor girls ranging in age from eight to seventeen,” Special Agent Miguel Collazo of Homeland Security Investigations said in the complaint.</p>

<p>The founder of a New York City music school for children was arrested this morning on federal charges alleging he had sex with teen girls and tried to arrange sexual contact with girls as young as 8 years old, authorities said. None of the alleged victims referred to in the criminal complaint appear to be students of the music teacher. Federal agents with Homeland Security Investigations showed up at the Queens home of Oliver Sohngen, owner of the Long Island City Academy of Music, who faces an eight-count federal complaint alleging he engaged in sex trafficking of a minor and other offenses, according to law enforcement sources and the criminal complaint. Sohngen, whose Facebook page says he is originally from Germany and that he studied at Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Institute of Music, allegedly used a pimp to arrange sexual encounters with girls 8 to 17 years old. The criminal complaint alleges he had sexual contact with a 15-year-old girl and a 17-year-old girl and tried to purchase sexual encounters with others ages 8 to 17. “Sohngen appears to have exchanged text messages with an individual for the purpose of purchasing commercial sex acts with minor girls ranging in age from eight to seventeen,” Special Agent Miguel Collazo of Homeland Security Investigations said in the complaint. “Moreover, on at least two occasions, Sohngen engaged in various forms of sexual contact with 15- and 17-year-old girls, both times arranged” by the same individual. Sometime between late 2015 and early 2016, the complaint alleges, Sohngen was talking by phone to an undercover New York City police officer pretending to be a 15-year-old girl. He allegedly tried to arrange to meet her for “oral sex and other sexual contact.” Investigators learned of Sohngen after the pimp he is alleged to have contacted was arrested in November 2013, according to the federal complaint. A search of the pimp’s phone allegedly revealed contact information for Sohngen. The complaint also said that two teens identified Sohngen as having paid to have sexual contact with them. Updated: May 12, 2017 - 4:15 PM - A federal jury has awarded a woman nearly $1 million in a case against a former Minnesota man who she says traveled to her native Laos and sexually assaulted her when she was 14 years old. Civil cases involving allegations of child sex tourism are rare, and the jury's verdict holds the man accountable for violating child sex tourism and child sex trafficking laws. The Associated Press is not naming the man because he was never criminally charged. The woman, Panyia Vang, moved to Minnesota with her family after she became pregnant with the man's child. "This verdict vindicates the courage Panyia Vang had to come forward with the truth and her pursuit of justice," said Patrick Arenz, one of Vang's attorneys. According to her lawsuit, Vang was an aspiring singer in the Laos countryside in 2006 when she believed she'd been offered an audition for a music video. In a deposition, the man, who had a wife in Minnesota, said he wasn't worried if the girl was 12 or 13 because he paid her family $5,000 to be his "bride." He also said the sex was consensual, and later argued she was an adult. She had his child in 2007 and moved to Minnesota in 2009, alleging in court documents that he threatened to keep her from seeing their child unless she submitted to his sexual demands. Miller said she hopes the verdict sends a message about the consequences of those who are interested in traveling overseas to have sex with underage girls. "There are a lot of people who would like to go to Laos and have sex with children and they make excuses for themselves," she said. </p>

<p>The city's beleaguered child-welfare agency plans to equip its front-line workers with high-tech devices that can alert the police if they’re in danger during investigations. Administration for Children’s Services Commissioner David Hansell announced the initiative at a City Council budget hearing Monday, stating that he wants to protect his agency’s 2,200 workers who perform checks on families around the city. “Front-line child-welfare workers have one of the toughest jobs in this city,” Hansell (photo inset) said. “Protecting themselves and the families they encounter is vital.” The initiative comes a month after two child protective specialists were held against their will while making a visit to an apartment in Wakefield, the Bronx, sources said. The two ACS workers had knocked on the door shortly after 6 p.m. on April 7. But a group of men who were partying inside would not allow the two women to leave for an nearly an hour, according to sources. The two workers did not suffer any physical injuries, but were temporarily reassigned to office duties and offered counseling, sources said. “It was a totally traumatic incident for both of these workers,” said Anthony Wells, the president of Local 371, the social service employees union that represents ACS workers. “Their mission is to make sure these children are safer. Oftentimes, it puts them in precarious and dangerous situations.” Hansell said that under the new safety initiative, child protective specialists will receive Samsung smartphones that come with a special app and a rip cord-like feature. If they feel unsafe, they would pull the strap out of the phone. The action alerts a 24-hour monitoring service to an ACS worker’s GPS location and allows police to be notified. The device is being used by the child-welfare system in Texas. ACS expects to implement the smartphone app by the end of the year. Each year, child protective specialists conduct more than 55,000 investigations of reported child abuse, according to the agency. ACS said that about 305 of the cases involve domestic violence accusations — which put workers at greater risk. Wells said the smartphones would help improve safety for his members. He said a new push to promote greater collaboration among child protective specialists and local NYPD precincts would also help. The partnership, which started this year, allows police officers to accompany ACS workers to a site when needed. ACS has also hired 100 former police detectives as investigative consultants who work on the agency’s more complex cases. Commissioner Hansell also said that front-line workers will have access to Windows Tablet devices, which will allow them to access a child-welfare database in the field as well as other information. The agency has come under intense scrutiny since the child abuse death of 6-year-old Zymere Perkins in September. FBI Director James Comey responded, May 3, before the Senate Judiciary Committee to a question from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on his announcement about re-opening the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server days before the election. [The latest: Comey says classified Clinton emails were forwarded to Anthony Weiner] SEN. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY (R-IOWA): … Director Comey, I'd like to swear you in at this point. Do you affirm that the testimony you're about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? But to once again thank you for being here today and we look forward to your testimony and answers to our questions. The way you guard against that is having people ask hard questions, ask good questions and demand straightforward answers, and I promise you I will do my absolute best to give you that answer today. I also appreciate the conversation I know we're going to have today and over the next few months about reauthorizing section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that you mentioned, Mr. Chairman. 702 is an essential tool and if it goes away we will be less safe as a country and I mean that and would be happy to talk more about that. The first was something I know that you followed closely, the plague of threats against Jewish community centers that this country experienced in the first few months of this year. </p>

<p>What started as one grab-and-go vegan sushi shop on 14th Street has now grown into its fourth location, the first full-service Beyond Sushi in New York City — with alcohol on the way, too. It might sound like an improbable success story: In a town full of top-notch, fish-filled sushi, a vegan sushi joint has somehow pushed its way into the already crowded space. It may seem like a ridiculous concept to eat sushi without fish, but the restaurant, from co-owners Guy and Tali Vaknin, has been expanding like mad. The latest location on 37th Street is by far the largest space yet — with 72 seats, Tali called it seven times bigger than the original location. The menu, in full below, is familiar, packed with the shop’s vegetable- and fruit-based rolls, which are exactly like regular sushi rolls but filled with items such as braised fennel, curried cauliflower, and mango. There are also noodle bowls, and rice paper wraps, plus the addition of two new desserts. But the major difference here is the introduction of alcohol. While it is still waiting for the license to come through, likely in June, once it does there will be sake, beer, wine, and low-ABV cocktails. Most of the drinks are sake-based and savory, such as the peppercorn martini (extra dry sake, dry vermouth, peppercorn juice, black caraway seeds, pickled green peppercorn) and fennel (dry sake, cucumber juice, candied fennel, fennel seed, dash of lime). The drink menu is also included below. It’s been a five year journey for the Vaknins since they opened the first location in Union Square, which blossomed into two more kiosks (Chelsea Market and Midtown West) before this full-service spot.

Mr. Hamilton) to the Tenement Museum, the cast iron buildings on Spring Street, the starry ceiling of Grand Central, the majestic reading rooms of the Public Library, the marquees of Broadway, the schist outcroppings of Central Park and Teddy Roosevelt on his horse defending the Natural History museum, the apartment palaces of the Upper West Side, the cheese department at Zabar's where you gain weight with every deep breath you take, Harlem, the Cloisters, the mighty Hudson — "When you're tired of New York, you're tired of life," Samuel Johnson did not say, but only because he never made it across the Atlantic nor into the 20th century. When spring is here, or rumored to be near, the city opens its doors and spills out onto the sidewalks. Cafes retract their front walls and set up tables, benches come out, greenmarkets set their flowers out on wooden pallets, people sit on the steps of brownstones or lean against parked cars, and everybody is talking at once. On Sunday, I walked to 83rd Street to mail some letters and passed a little Victorian firehouse, one truck wide, wedged in the row of brownstones holding off the invasion of high-rise condos, a few of which tower on the horizon, like cat trees among rows of file cabinets. A truck double-parked on 83rd, with "Integrity General Contractors" written on the door. A papa stood on the corner, embracing one tall daughter, then the other. Brisk walkers passing us amblers, dog people walking their livestock who strained to sniff the food on the cafe tables. The sun was out after a gray Saturday and there was good feeling everywhere you looked. What made New York so great was many things, including the coastline and rivers and proximity of water, the mix of commercial and residential, the five-story blocks, five stories being how high our great-grandparents cared to climb in the pre-elevator days, leaving plenty of sunshine for pedestrians to bask in. People truck in the goods, truck out the garbage, you're living on a loading dock, you have to deal with it. Back where I'm from, in Grid City out on the flatlands, you say, "Oh, pardon me" if you come within two feet of someone. At 81st, I went down into the subway and the downtown train rolled in just as I reached the platform, one of those transformative moments — every little thing you've done all day up to that moment feels perfectly timed — and squeezed into the car without actually touching anyone. I hung on to the overhead bar, feet nicely spread, as we rumbled south, six complete strangers within a few inches of me, everyone in his or her own space, avoiding eye contact, thinking their own thoughts. Too bad that some people only ride in limos with police escorts and miss out on this essential and beneficial experience. On May 8, 2013, Alan Eustace, then the 56-year-old senior vice president of knowledge at Google, jumped from an airplane18,000 feet above the desert in Coolidge, Arizona. He hadn’t quite worked out how to control the space suit, which, unlike a typical skydiving suit, weighed about 265 pounds and was pumped full of pressurized air. Eustace, an experienced skydiver, knew how to shift his body to change direction or to stop himself from spinning—a problem that, if uncorrected, can lead to blackout, then death. </p>

<p> But they do. In 16 dynamic urban areas (Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, Aix-en-Provence, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, Nice, Nantes, Strasbourg, Grenoble, Rennes, Rouen, Toulon, Douai-Lens and Montpellier), the world’s resources have proved a profitable complement to those found in France. Immi­grants – not native French workers – do most of these jobs. Guilluy disagrees. People tend to snicker when the question of political correctness is raised: its practitioners because no one wants to be thought politically correct; and its targets because no one wants to admit to being coerced. Less than 2 per cent of legislators in France’s National Assembly today come from the working class, as opposed to 20 per cent just after the Second World War. But it’s quite possible to get cut off. Some classes also offer the option to show off your work in front of an agent during the last class. Why this should be so is an economic controversy. Why would they think otherwise? A New Yorker might see these two bourgeoisies as analogous to residents of the Upper East and Upper West sides. ***

At the heart of Guilluy’s inquiry is globalisation. This article was first published in the quarterly magazine City Journal In a knowledge economy, these workers have largely been exiled from the places where the economy still functions. In a society as divided as Guilluy describes, traditional politics can find no purchase. The banding together of establishment parties to defend the system against anti-system parties is happening all over the world. Guilluy has spent years in and out of buildings in northern Paris (his sisters live in public housing), and he is sensitive to the way this works in France.</p>

<p>Image via Getty. As part of the Trump administration’s continued war on immigrants, last week a federal immigration officer showed up at Public School 58 in Queens in search of a fourth grade student. But thanks to a citywide policy that allows schools to deny officers entry without a warrant, school officials turned the agent away. Advertisement In a statement regarding the incident, which happened on Thursday, New York City Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña said, “We’re looking into this incident and are providing schools with additional information on our protocol and more trainings.” “All students, regardless of immigration status, are welcome in NYC public schools, and parents should rest assured that we will do everything on our power to protect students, staff and families,” she said. Advertisement “As a mother, I am deeply troubled and horrified at this attempt on the part of federal immigration agents to reach any child in our schools. PS 58 officials did the right thing by following proper protocols of the city administration, stopping the agents at the door and protecting their students,” Queens Borough President Melinda Katz told Pix11. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the policy in March in response to the Trump administration’s crackdown on sanctuary cities. “We’re not allowing (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents in the building, because I think parents are so afraid right now, and are worried that an agent could literally come into a building and single out their child, we want them to know that can’t happen under this policy,” he said. Thursday’s incident appears to be the first time school officials have had to enforce the policy in New York City. Since Trump’s election, arrests of undocumented immigrants with no criminal records have more than doubled from the same period last year. Under the new administration, federal immigration officials have arrested undocumented immigrants protected under DACA, a victim of domestic violence who was seeking a protection order, and a father of four who was dropping his kids off to school. Sponsored In a statement confirming the incident to CBS2, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson said that two officials visited the school “as part of an administrative inquiry pertaining to an immigration benefit request” and explained that “[a]lthough school visits are not routine in these circumstances, they are not unprecedented.” “I must emphasize that the purpose of the visit was to verify certain facts about the student’s enrollment in relation to a request for an immigration benefit,” the statement continued. “At no time did the officers ask to see or speak with the student, who was not the subject of the administrative inquiry.” Here, in a series we call “How I Lead,” we feature principals and assistant principals who have been recognized for their work. You can see other pieces in the series here. At first, the teachers were nervous, wondering why he was coming by so often. Chamberlin learned something, too: Focus more on the results teachers are getting and less on the way they get them. He likes to say, “I don’t care as much about how you organize your kitchen. I care more about the quality of the meal.” Chamberlin won the 2015 Administrator of the Year Award from SHAPE Colorado, a professional group of health and physical education teachers. Under his leadership, Fraser Valley Elementary has also won several awards for excellence. We asked Chamberlin how he thinks about leadership, what brain science has taught him and how lagging school funding affects his staff. What was your first education job and what sparked your interest in the field? My first formal paid education job was as a high school teacher in Craig, Colorado. Ironically, I didn’t have a Spanish endorsement but had put on the top of my resume that I had a “strong desire to work with Spanish-speaking students.” Back then social studies teachers were plentiful and jobs scarce. Fortunately, I was able to attend night classes at Colorado Mountain College in Steamboat Springs to get Spanish credit hours and lesson ideas to use that first year of teaching. Over the summer I was able to complete and add a Spanish endorsement and enjoyed a second year of teaching and coaching varsity soccer, and I did get to work with some Spanish-speaking students. My interest in education was sparked by positive relationships with my teachers and coaches at Bear Creek High School in Jefferson County. My father is a retired administrator from Cherry Creek School District and my mother is a retired physical education teacher from Cherry Creek. My interest in the field of education was solidified at the University of Northern Colorado, where I became involved in student government and was elected Vice President of Faculty Affairs. This opportunity provided me a unique education around the policy and politics of public education and teacher training. The opportunity to be present in the classrooms every day gives me insight into the student and teacher dynamics that drive the school climate and culture. At first, the teachers were really uncomfortable with the frequency of my visits, but over time they realized that it’s my “style” to gain a better understanding of what is going on with students and staff. As a new principal, I spent too much time focusing on teacher behaviors in the classroom. What I have come to understand is that the student behaviors and outcomes — as a result of the teacher’s decision-making and ability to unpack the learning target — are equally important. I try to learn all the students’ names and associate an interest or activity with them so when we visit I can ask about their particular interest. As an elementary principal, I spend hours in the lunchroom and the playground engaging with students and observing how they are interacting with each other and the adults around them. I am also fortunate to have school-age children of my own who participate in numerous activities where I can engage in some positive sideline support. Tell us about a time that a teacher evaluation didn’t go as expected — for better or for worse? At about the same time, the district sent out the “intent to return forms.” I had looked over the form and the teacher indicated she wanted to transfer to another building and wanted to retire in the next three years. So I carefully set up ample time to visit with the teacher thinking we had some differences to discuss and the teacher had some concerns about her satisfaction in the building and profession. Halfway into the conference I wasn’t getting any indication of her dissatisfaction so I asked for a moment, went to the front office to get a copy of her intent to return form, set it in front of her and asked her to help me understand the form. </p>

President Trump's national security adviser said Tuesday that the president's decision to reveal highly classified information during a meeting with Russian officials last week was "wholly appropriate" — the latest attempt by the White House to contain the explosive disclosure that Trump potentially jeopardized a crucial intelligence source on the Islamic State. “He made the decision in the context of the conversation,” he said.

<p>McMaster spoke to reporters May 16 about President Trump's May 10 conversation with Russian officials in the Oval Office. (Reuters) President Trump's national security adviser said Tuesday that the president's decision to reveal highly classified information during a meeting with Russian officials last week was "wholly appropriate" — the latest attempt by the White House to contain the explosive disclosure that Trump potentially jeopardized a crucial intelligence source on the Islamic State. McMaster, the president's top security adviser, repeatedly described the president's actions in a press briefing just a day after a Washington Post story revealed that Trump had shared deeply sensitive information with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during an Oval Office meeting last week. "In the context of that discussion, what the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he’s engaged," McMaster said. "It is wholly appropriate for the president to share whatever information he thinks is necessary to advance the security of the American people. McMaster refused to confirm whether the information the president shared with the Russians was highly classified. However, because the president has broad authority to declassify information, it is unlikely that his disclosures to the Russians were illegal — as they would have been had just about anyone else in government shared the same secrets. But the classified information he shared with a geopolitical foe was nonetheless explosive, having been provided by a critical U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so delicate that some details were withheld even from top allies and other government officials. McMaster added that Trump made a spur-of-the-moment decision to share the information in the context of the conversation he was having with the Russian officials. He said that "the president wasn’t even aware of where this information came from" and had not been briefed on the source. "I wanted to make clear to everybody that the president in no way compromised any sources or methods in the course of this conversation," the national security adviser said. During a May 10 meeting with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak, Trump began describing details about an Islamic State terror threat, according to current and former U.S. officials. (The Washington Post) McMaster's pushback came just hours after Trump himself acknowledged Tuesday morning in a pair of tweets that he had indeed revealed highly classified information to Russia — a stunning confirmation of the Washington Post story and a move that seemed to contradict his own White House team after it scrambled to deny the report. Trump's tweets tried to explain away the news, which emerged late Monday, that he had shared sensitive, “code-word” information with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador during the White House meeting last week. Trump described his talks with the Russians as “an openly scheduled” meeting at the White House. [Russia denies Trump shared classified details during Oval Office meeting] “As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety,” Trump wrote Tuesday morning. “Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.” As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining.... — Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017 Trump's tweets undercut his administration's frantic effort Monday night to contain the damaging report. The White House trotted out three senior administration officials — McMaster, deputy national security adviser Dina Powell and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — to attack the reports, though they never quite said the initial report was incorrect. But in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, Trump later admitted that he had made the decision to fire Comey well before Rosenstein's memo, in part because he was frustrated by the director's investigation into possible collusion between his presidential campaign and the Russian government. At the time, Trump was surprised by the almost universal bipartisan backlash to his decision, and he raged at his staff, threatening to shake up his already tumultuous West Wing. I have been asking Director Comey & others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017 The irony seemed to be lost on Trump that — at least in the case of sharing classified intelligence with the Russians — he was, in fact, the original leaker. The White House national security advisor again denied that President Trump improperly shared classified information with Russian diplomats in an Oval Office meeting last week, seeking to quell growing criticism of Trump's reported disclosure. McMaster said Trump "wasn't even aware" of the source of the information and again called "the premise" of a Washington Post report that Trump had improperly shared highly classified intelligence "false." “It is wholly appropriate for the president to share whatever information he thinks is to the advancement of the security of the American people,” McMaster said. McMaster said that if any official later called to warn U.S. intelligence agencies about a potential breach, it was “maybe from an overabundance of caution." He said Trump raised the issue “as a basis for common action and coordination” to address the threat from terrorism. </p>

AN international army of experts were hunting down the cyber attackers who brought the NHS to its knees and infected computer systems in dozens of countries around the globe. Some of this will come from researchers analysing code but some may come from secret signals intelligence collected from the United States' National Security Agency and the UK's GCHQ spying on global communications: this was reportedly used to attribute the attack on Sony to North Korea. The Lazarus group was seen as responsible. False flag operations - posing as someone else to mislead investigators - are particularly easy to undertake online. It is possible North Korea looked for some way to strike back (similar to the way Iran struck back against US banks and Arabian Gulf energy companies after its nuclear programme was hit). A cyber-security consultancy firm also says it knows of some people who had paid but had not yet had their data decrypted. There remains some mystery as to how the campaign was first launched. However, it is too early to make any assessment of North Korean involvement with a high degree of confidence.</p>

<p>Image copyright Getty Images The hunt is on for the cyber-attackers who struck last week and the first clues are emerging - but they are far from conclusive. The initial assumption was that a criminal gang was behind the attack because ransomware is typical of such groups out to make money (rather than states, which tend to engage in espionage and sabotage). But officials say they are now not discounting the possibility of North Korean involvement, although emphasising the evidence so far is fragmentary. The code behind the attack might have been damaging but it was not actually that complex. Nothing, for instance, on the scale of Stuxnet (developed by the US and Israel) which targeted Iran's nuclear programme and took years of development. "Devious rather than sophisticated," was how one person described it, particularly devious in the way it used a replicating worm to spread the code from machine to machine. Experts are looking for "patient zero" - the first computer to be infected to understand the method of delivery. From that point on, the malware spread virulently because it looked for computers to spread to within an organisation but also looked across the internet for other computers it could connect to and infect. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption South Korea has monitored the attacks but could they have been launched from North Korea? The amount demanded was relatively small, as were the number of Bitcoin wallets into which it was to be paid. So far, experts at Elliptic, a British company which works with law enforcement to track down such payments, says it has not seen any money taken out of the accounts. A cyber-security consultancy firm also says it knows of some people who had paid but had not yet had their data decrypted. Some of these signs have led people to question whether the attackers were relatively amateurish and did not understand quite what they had unleashed and what the consequences would be. The possibility stems from an overlap in the malware used in an early version of the ransomware (later removed) with a tool previously exclusively used by a North Korean group often known as Lazarus. One cyber-security analyst also said that people watching the North Korean group had, in previous months, seen them tinkering with aspects of Bitcoin, which could be read as potential preparation to launch a campaign. Sony was hit (with both data theft and the wiping of computers) because it was releasing a film involving the North Korean leader. North Korea may also have been linked to an attack on the Swift banking network which led to a massive theft from the Bangladesh Central Bank, with some experts believing this was carried out by an offshoot from the Lazarus group. Image copyright GCHQ Image caption Staff at GCHQ are likely to be among those hunting the attackers The use of ransomware would be a departure for Pyongyang, although it is the one state which is thought to have used cyber-attacks for financial purposes. One thing that might make this more plausible is the timing, coming just after pressure was put on the country over missile and nuclear tests (which might themselves have been the target of US cyber-attacks to sabotage their success). However, it is too early to make any assessment of North Korean involvement with a high degree of confidence. Some of this will come from researchers analysing code but some may come from secret signals intelligence collected from the United States' National Security Agency and the UK's GCHQ spying on global communications: this was reportedly used to attribute the attack on Sony to North Korea. A spokesman said: “The recent attack is at an unprecedented level and will require a complex international investigation to identify the culprits.” Hundreds of operations were cancelled and patients turned away from A&E after the unprecedented global cyberattack wreaked havoc in 99 countries worldwide yesterday. Hackers using malware “stolen from the NSA” crippled 45 NHS trusts and caused disruption across at least 45,000 computer networks in 99 countries in the unprecedented global attack yesterday.

<p> It is a private visit by the president, and it's not your business." "No Israeli leaders will join President Trump at the Western Wall." “Israel has asked the US about this,” the PMO official said. It was captured along with the rest of the Old City and East Jerusalem in the 1967 war, and annexed by Israel as part of its united capital — a move not recognized internationally. It’s not your territory. The Monday night TV report said the Trump team had yet to respond definitively to the Masada request. The Walla news site reported that the Prime Minister’s Office requested that Netanyahu give a speech of five to seven minutes alongside the US president. "This is in the West Bank. They also reportedly spurned an offer from the Israelis to help make the arrangements. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that Trump is assessing whether moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would help or hurt prospects for clinching an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal

“The president is being very careful to understand how such a decision would impact a peace process,” Tillerson said in an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He said Trump’s decision would be informed by feedback from all sides, “most certainly” including “whether Israel views it as helpful to a peace initiative or perhaps a distraction.”

Following Tillerson’s remarks, Netanyahu responded that the move would advance peace efforts. National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, DC on May 16, 2017.

<p>President Donald Trump heads to Israel next week where he is poised to make history by becoming the first sitting president to visit the Western Wall — one of the holiest sites in Judaism. Trump "will say a prayer at the Western Wall," National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said Tuesday, who characterized it as a private visit. "No Israeli leaders will join President Trump at the Western Wall." National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, DC on May 16, 2017. Olivier Douliery / AFP - Getty Images McMaster added that Trump, who is also making stops in Saudi Arabia and The Vatican during his first trip abroad as president, is "going to the Western Wall mainly in connection with the theme to connect with three of the world's great religions." "The President's intention is to visit these religious sites to highlight the need for unity among three of the world's great religions," he said. "Unity in confronting a very grave threat to civilization, and unity in embracing an agenda of tolerance." Still, there is a reason why no sitting U.S. president has even visited the site: It was seized from the Jordanians, along with East Jerusalem and the West Bank in 1967, and it's not officially recognized as Israeli territory. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all visited the Western Wall as private citizens or as candidates — and never accompanied by an Israeli prime minister. Also, East Jerusalem is where the Palestinians want to situate the capital of their independent state. But even before Trump sets foot in the Holy Land, he appears to have been tripped-up by his advance team. The diplomatic dust-up happened, according to Israel's Channel Two News, when U.S. representatives in Jerusalem turned down a request to have Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tag along with Trump, saying the president was making a "private" visit to Judaism's holiest sites. They also reportedly spurned an offer from the Israelis to help make the arrangements. "This isn't your territory," one of the reps reportedly told the Israelis. It is a private visit by the president, and it's not your business." Jews pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City on Jan. 17, 2017. But as president he has yet to move forward with that — aware that the move could inflame the Arab world and possibly lead to renewed violence. For Morton Klein of the Zionist Organization of America, whose group opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, the controversy is just the latest disappointment from the Trump administration. "We have praised his public stances concerning Israel but he seems to be backtracking at this point on things like moving the (U.S.) embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem," Klein told NBC News, adding he was also disappointed when Trump invited Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to the White House. In a bitter diplomatic incident, a senior member of the US delegation making preparations for Donald Trump’s visit to Israel next week angrily rejected a request that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accompany the president when he visits the Western Wall, and then sniped at his Israeli counterparts that the Western Wall is “not your territory. An official at the Prime Minister’s Office confirmed the Channel 2 report, telling the Times of Israel that Israeli officials were “shocked” by the comments and have asked the Trump administration about the incident. The official said that Netanyahu is certain that the comment does not reflect President Trump’s policy. The Western Wall, part of the retaining walls of the Second Temple compound, is the closest point of prayer for Jews to the site of the Temple itself and thus the Jewish people’s holiest place of prayer. It was captured along with the rest of the Old City and East Jerusalem in the 1967 war, and annexed by Israel as part of its united capital — a move not recognized internationally. According to the TV report, the angry exchanges began when the Israeli team working with the American delegation asked whether Netanyahu could accompany Trump when he visits the Western Wall, a key expected stop on his May 22-23 visit to Israel and the West Bank. No serving US president has ever visited the Western Wall, because US policy has been that the final status of Jerusalem has yet to be resolved in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The US delegation reportedly rejected the request for Netanyahu to join the visit, saying it would be “a private visit” by the president and that he would go on his own. At this point, the TV report said, a senior American official rudely responded: “What are you talking about? It’s part of the West Bank.” These comments led to vociferous protests by the Israelis, with the discussion descending into shouting, and the Israelis reminding the US team that the Western Wall and adjacent area “is territory holy to Israel.” In a statement reported by Channel 2, an official at the Prime Minister’s Office said that “the comment that the Western Wall is part of the West Bank was received with astonishment” but that “Israel is certain that the comment contradicts President Trump’s policy as expressed in his fierce opposition to the latest UN Security Council resolution” — a reference to UNSC Resolution 2334 from last December, which rejected Israeli rights in Jerusalem and which Trump publicly opposed. “Israel has asked the US about this,” the PMO official said. “We’re a bit tired, but we wanted to come straight to the holiest place in the entire Jewish world, the ‘Kotel Hama’aravi,’ the Western Wall, so we straight came here,” Friedman said in a filmed statement provided by the US Embassy, flanked by his wife Tammy and his daughter Talia. Earlier Monday, a senior official in Jerusalem said Netanyahu is looking to deliver a speech at Masada together with Trump during the president’s visit, but that the American delegation organizing Trump’s visit has expressed reservations about the idea. Several US presidents have gone to the holy site, but only before or after holding their terms in office. </p>

This image provided by the State Department and DigitalGlobe, taken April 18, 2017, shows a satellite image of what the State Department described as a building in a prison complex in Syria that was modified to support a crematorium. State Department/DigitalGlobe/AP (BEIRUT) — The Syrian government on Tuesday "categorically" denied U.S. accusations of mass killings at a prison near Damascus, including the alleged execution of political opponents and burning the victims in a crematorium at the site. The Foreign Ministry said the allegations are a "new Hollywood plot" to justify U.S. intervention in Syria. It described the allegations as "lies" and "fabrications," noting what it called a U.S. track record of using false claims as a pretext for military aggression. The State Department said Monday that it believes about 50 detainees are being hanged each day at the Saydnaya military prison, a 45-minute drive north of Damascus. Many of the bodies are then burned in the crematorium "to cover up the extent of mass murders taking place," said Stuart Jones, the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, accusing President Bashar Assad's government of sinking "to a new level of depravity." The allegation of mass killings came as President Donald Trump weighs options in Syria, where the U.S. launched cruise missiles on a government air base last month after accusing Assad's military of killing scores of civilians with a sarin-like nerve agent. The latest accusations have cast a shadow over Syria peace talks in Geneva, where Syrian government and opposition representatives sat down separately with the U.N. envoy as talks got underway on Tuesday. "The U.S. administration's accusations against the Syrian government of a so-called crematorium in Saydnaya prison, in addition to the broken record about the use of barrel bombs and chemical weapons, are categorically false," the Syrian Foreign Ministry said. The allegation could test the Trump administration's willingness to respond to alleged atrocities other than chemical weapons attacks, which Washington blames on Assad's government. Western monitors and watchdog groups say they have accumulated evidence of mass killings in Syrian government prisons, though there have not been any substantiated allegations so far of the use of a crematorium. Syrian opposition spokesman Salem Meslet said the U.S. allegations that the Syrian government had built a crematorium to cover up its mass killings were "credible" and not surprising. Meslet, in Geneva for the U.N.-mediated talks, told Saudi-owned TV station al-Hadath that the government was known to move prisoners around from site to site for interrogations and, in some instances, executions. The State Department released commercial satellite photographs showing what it described as a building in the prison complex that was modified to support the crematorium. The photographs, taken over the course of several years, beginning in 2013, do not prove the building is a crematorium, but show construction consistent with such use. The revelations echoed a February report by Amnesty International that said Syria's military police hanged as many as 13,000 people in four years before carting out bodies by the truckload for burial in mass graves. Syrian activists meanwhile said government forces were escalating attacks on opposition-held areas protected under a recently brokered cease-fire agreement. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it has recorded the first fatalities inside the country's four "de-escalation zones" since the agreement came into effect 10 days ago. The Observatory said two women were killed by rocket fire in a Damascus suburb and another was killed in aerial bombardment in central Homs province. Wael Abou Rayan, a media activist in the Homs countryside, said the bombardment of Homs eased since the agreement came into force, but never completely stopped. Two children were killed by government artillery fire in the rural town of Rastan two days ago, while another woman was killed in an air strike in the village of Kafrlaha on Tuesday, according to Abou Rayan. And outside Damascus, the Syrian Civil Defense search and rescue group said three surface-to-surface rockets struck the Hamouriya area, killing six people and wounding dozens of others, including women and children. Video from the group showed rescuers pulling children from the rubble of a multi-story building. Before the start of business, Just Security provides a curated summary of up-to-the-minute developments at home and abroad. The intelligence Trump boasted about to the Russians concerned an Islamic State plot and included details of the plot’s intention to use laptops to attack aeroplanes and the city in which it had been uncovered, officials said, the information – so sensitive that U.S. officials did not share it widely with the government or pass it on to other allies – provided by a Middle Eastern ally. McMaster told reporters last night, insisting that “at no time” during Trump’s meeting with the Russians was anything discussed other than military operations that were already publicly known. McMaster didn’t actually deny reports that the President leaked classified information, his statement that “at no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed” a suggestion that the original story from the Washington Post had reported something that it hadn’t in order to deny something – military operations aren’t even mentioned in the story, points out Aaron Blake at the Washington Post. White House staff were literally “hiding in offices” as reporters descended after the story broke last night, a senior Trump aide told The Daily Beast’s Lachlan Markay, Tim Mak, Asawin Suebsaeng and Jana Winter. “What do the Russians have on Donald Trump?” Pelosi speculated that the Russian government is holding something over the President’s head to make him accede to their needs, the Hill’s Olivia Beavers reports. This is not a legal issue – it is the president’s prerogative whether he shares information and with whom – but a matter of competence and national security, Bryan Bender explains at POLITICO. Immaturity is becoming the leitmotif of Trump’s presidency, and his leaks to the Russian officials was a result of his sloppiness, his lack of impulse control, and above all the fact that he is “a 7-year-old boy desperate for the approval of those he admires,” writes David Brooks at the New York Times. While news that Trump revealed secret information with the Russians has left intelligence officials astounded, the President has a track record of questioning, worrying and even directly upsetting intelligence officials, as Amber Phillips explains at the Washington Post. Senators are warning the Trump administration, which could announce its pick as soon as this week after eight contenders including Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) were interviewed over the weekend. </p>

We cannot accept the continued humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and we will support Palestinian recognition at the UN. The biggest change in cost terms is the commitment to end tuition fees, which Labour puts at £11.2bn, the single most expensive measure in the manifesto. The biggest changes are in the attached costing document, which puts a figure on Labour's spending commitments and identifies £50bn worth of tax rises to pay for them. However, under John McDonnell's fiscal rule, these are infrastructure, not day-to-day spending, so they don't need to be funded out of existing tax rises.

<h1><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/16/politics/trump-hotel-projection/">'Pay Trump bribes here' sign projected onto Trump's DC hotel</a></h1>
<h2>SumBasic Method</h2>
<p> Additional context, though, complicates this picture. This practice is nothing new for Trump. President Donald Trump’s finances are infamously opaque. There may soon be more than one Trump Hotel in Washington D.C. Who could have been present? The stock was worth between $500,001 and $1,000,000 in 2015 and between $15,001 and $50,000 in 2016. The situation perfectly encapsulates the way the president’s business interests are coming up against those of the country. But he still owns the company, which means he will still profit from his properties. This is a perfect example of a conflict of interest in practice: Trump has an incentive to host an event at Mar-a-Lago (personal financial gain) that runs directly counter to what would be best for the country’s security (hosting the event at the White House or an otherwise secure location). But there is also an incentive for the city government to work with the Trump Organization in finding a suitable expansion plan. It is unknown whether Guo will be at Mar-a-Lago, or even in Palm Beach, at the time of Trump’s meeting with Xi. The Trump Organization is selling the property through the real-estate agency and auction house Sotheby’s; according to the listing for the complex , the price is available only upon request.

Those Indonesian Politicians

Despite President Trump’s assurance that he has stopped pursuing deals since the election, his namesake organization apparently moved forward with a pair of projects in Indonesia. Exactly how much money remains unknown, as the Department of Defense has yet to publicly state how much space they will be renting and for how long.</p>
<h2>LSTM-based Method</h2>
<p>Story highlights Washington-based artist was behind messages projected onto Trump Hotel in DC Emoluments clause and Russian flag figured in the visual display (CNN) Visitors to the Trump International Hotel in Washington were greeted with a provocative message Monday night: "Pay Trump bribes here." Artist and filmmaker Robin Bell said he projected those words onto the hotel's facade from a van across the street, hoping to call attention to accusations that President Donald Trump is allowing foreign leaders to pay for access by staying at a Trump property just a few blocks from the White House. "It's a pretty clear cut example of impropriety," Bell said in a phone interview. The rules and the lines are being pushed so far and this seemed to be so clear to me." Bell also projected the text of the emoluments clause, which prohibits US officials from accepting foreign gifts, onto the hotel's facade, alongside images of the Turkish and Russian flags. Because the President oversees the GSA, Trump effectively became both landlord and tenant when he was sworn in. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, filed a lawsuit alleging that Trump’s business holdings violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which makes it illegal for government officials to “accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” CREW’s bipartisan legal team includes, among others, Norm Eisen and Richard Painter, who served as ethics lawyers under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush, respectively; Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University; and Zephyr Teachout, a professor at Fordham University (and former congressional candidate) who is considered an authority on the Emoluments Clause. All have been vocally critical of Trump’s continued refusal to sell off his business, and are now taking their case to court to argue that several of Trump’s businesses present avenues by which foreign governments could seek to influence the president by, for example, booking stays at one of his hotels or renting space at one of his properties. Additionally, the lawsuit seeks to force Trump to reveal his tax returns, something every president has done since Gerald Ford but which Trump has refused to do, significantly limiting the public’s ability to understand the president’s finances . When asked about the lawsuit, Trump described it as “totally without merit .” Eisen was quick to respond on Twitter, offering to “debate Trump (or his chosen champion) on the merits of our case anytime,” making it clear that CREW intends to continue to pursue its case. (CREW has also filed a separate complaint to the General Services Administration arguing that Trump has violated the lease on his Washington, D.C. hotel, which states that “no … elected official of the Government of the United States … shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.”) President Donald Trump still has not taken the necessary steps to distance himself from his businesses while in office. In accordance with a plan that he and one of his lawyers, Sheri Dillon, laid out at a press conference on January 11 , Trump has filed paperwork to remove himself from the day-to-day operation of his eponymous organization. However, numerous ethics experts have voiced strenuous objections to the plan, which they say does very little to resolve the issue: As long as Trump continues to profit from his business empire—which he does whether or not he is nominally in charge—they say, the possibility that outside actors will attempt to affect his policies by plumping up his pocketbook will remain very much in play. CREW’s lawsuit is just the latest development in what promises to be a continuing saga regarding Trump’s many conflicts of interest that began almost as soon as he won the presidency. Along with his unprecedented wealth, Trump brings to the office unique and gravely concerning entanglements that, whether he recognizes their effects or not, threaten to undermine his decision-making as president. The plan Trump and Dillon announced on January 11 would do very little to resolve the conflicts: It places control of his assets in the hands of his two adult sons and a longtime associate of their father’s with what so far amounts to a pinky-swear assurance that, despite their proximity to the president, they will not discuss any aspect of the business with him. Unless Trump acts to put actual distance between himself and his business ventures, these questions are likely to continue throughout his time in the Oval Office. On top of the aforementioned legal actions, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, has declared Trump’s efforts insufficient, remarking, “I don’t think divestiture is too high of a price to pay to be the president of the United States,” and a number of Senate Democrats have introduced legislation that would force Trump to divest or face impeachment. The most recent entries appear at the top: Even before his most recent plan was laid out, Trump has attempted to deflect criticism by repeatedly asserting that the law barring executive-branch officials from maintaining financial holdings or business ties that overlap with their duties does not apply to the president or vice president. In this, he is correct ; the law, passed in 1989, exempts the two chief executives from conflict-of-interest rules on the understanding that their purview is so broad that it would be impossible for them to completely disentangle themselves. The Trump Organization is selling the property through the real-estate agency and auction house Sotheby’s; according to the listing for the complex , the price is available only upon request. On his FEC disclosure forms , Trump lists the property as worth between $5 million and $25 million, which does correspond with the $19.7 million he paid for it four years ago. According to the disclosure forms Trump submitted to the Federal Election Commission (which remain the only public documentation of his finances ), he derived between $100,001 and $1 million from the property in the year leading up to May 2016. Had Trump taken the measures suggested repeatedly by ethics experts on both sides of the political aisle, he would by now have put his assets in what’s called a blind trust, which would entail turning over his empire to a third party with whom he will have no contact, who would sell off the properties and reinvest the resulting money in other assets without providing the president any information about the sales or the purchases. Instead, Trump has set up a system under which, even if he does proceed to sell off his business, one property at a time, he will simply create new conflicts of interest as he takes payments from those who are purchasing the Trump Organization’s real estate. As NPR noted , the Trump Organization’s decision to sell Le Château des Palmiers is “the first known major divestiture of a Trump property since he became president.” As such, it demonstrates the insufficiency of the steps the president has taken to eliminate his conflicts of interest. Trump has put the leadership of his company in the hands of his adult sons and a longtime Trump Organization executive with relatively few—and, based on Donald Jr. and Eric’s frequent presence at administration events and Eric’s statement that he will share some business-related data with his father, relatively permeable—barriers blinding him from knowledge of his financial interests. Though Trump no longer runs the Trump Organization, he still owns the company and, by extension, the property, meaning that he will profit from its sale. It would even be possible for somebody to make an offer well above the currently unknown asking price to curry favor with him (and, possibly, through the artful use of a shell company , hide their identity). The company’s headquarters in a strip mall the outskirts of Las Vegas are registered to two individuals named Jun Xu and Qi Huang; however, the reporters were unable to reach Xu and Huang through either their listed addresses and phone numbers or through business associates. A third individual associated with Milan, Chen Huang, also apparently could not be reached for comment, nor did the Trump Organization respond to inquiries about the identities of the buyers. The newspaper’s attempts to find the buyers of other Trump Organization condos met with mixed results: Though reporters were able to track down the real people behind some of the purchases, including a couple who said they bought the property because they’re fans of Trump’s, others proved just as elusive as whoever is behind Milan. Since he has not followed the long-standing presidential custom of releasing his tax returns to the public, the only publicly available records of where he derives his income are his two filings with the Federal Elections Commission . Though the letter declares only that he can run, not necessarily that he will run, it gives broad coverage for the president to begin fundraising and holding campaign events, and to do so far earlier in his first term than have previous presidents. </p>

<p>Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates is dismissing calls from Democrats for her to enter the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race. “I am totally ruling out the governor’s race," Yates said in an interview published Tuesday by The New Yorker. "I am not running for governor.” Yates drew plenty of praise from the left after her testimony to senators earlier this month defending her brief time in the Trump White House, which included warning others about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's possibly compromising interactions with Russian officials. President Trump fired Yates for refusing to back his travel ban against several Muslim-majority nations. “She will have to give Georgians a really good reason why she’s not considering running for a constitutional office in 2018,” a Democratic strategist in the state told The Hill last week. She told The New Yorker she recognizes her elevated position after Trump's decision to fire her, and will put it to good use. ADVERTISEMENT "I recognize that I may have a voice that I didn’t have before. And part of what I want to be able to do is to figure out how I can responsibly use that voice in a way to impact things that I think really matter," she explained. "I just don’t know what form that takes,” Yates added, “I’ve got to give something more back.” Yates also pushed back against the White House's narrative over the extent of her warning about Flynn. “We had just gone and told them that the national-security adviser, of all people, was compromised with the Russians and that their vice president and others had been lying to the American people about it. It was more than a "heads-up," Yates said. Yates also revealed that she had no knowledge of Trump's plans to implement his controversial travel ban before it was announced. “I had been sitting in [White House counsel] Don McGahn’s office an hour before to talk about the Flynn issue and he didn’t tell me,” she remarked. While showing her the door, Trump said Yates had "betrayed" the country by refusing to defend his ban. More on this to come later, but the four men running for chairman of the Georgia Republican party debated before the Gwinnett County GOP on Monday night. Duluth lies well outside the Sixth District, where Republican Karen Handel is locked in a surprisingly tight and very expensive runoff to replace U.S. Rep. Tom Price in Congress. But the state GOP, crippled by a racial discrimination lawsuit and a resulting lack of cash, has been far more limited in its ability to give Handel a hand. The next chairman of the Georgia GOP will be elected at the party’s convention on June 3, just over two weeks before the June 20 runoff in the Sixth District. The race was a hot topic of conversation in the struggling shopping mall where the Gwinnett GOP has its headquarters. Alex Johnson, a DeKalb County attorney making a third bid to lead the state party, was the most critical. Said Johnson: “We should never have been in this situation that we’re currently in. “We need to make sure the state Republican party already has tons of people around the state – thousands upon thousands who can be touched with a text message, saying how to get them involved in a race like the Sixth District. “So we’re not in a situation like we’re currently in, where turnout is scary because we don’t have enough volunteers and resources to make it happen.” John Watson, a former chief of staff for Gov. Sonny Perdue who is now a lobbyist, cited the race as a call to arms: “We are financially broke, the state party is mismanaged, and the Democrats are on the march, and trying to achieve victory by stealing from us what we’ve worked so hard for over the past 15 years.” Michael McNeely, currently the first vice chair of the state party, would be the first African-American elected to the chairmanship. Said McNeely: “One of the things that’s happened in our party – there’s been a breakdown in the relationships between the party and its elected officials and candidates. In a race like this, we need to go to the candidate and find out what that candidate needs.” Mike Welsh, former chairman of the 12th District GOP, cited his role – several times during the debate — in bringing down John Barrow, the last white Democratic member of Congress from Georgia. The very first thing you have to do is understand what’s going on so far, and get with the candidate. But down toward the bottom, you’ll see the name of Brian Robinson, who was Deal’s spokesman in office and during that bitter 2010 GOP runoff for governor: It might be time to dust off some of those old press releases. If you’ll look more closely, you’ll see the name of only one candidate for chairman of the Georgia GOP on the list as well: John Watson. In a statement on Monday, the Republican gubernatorial candidate said he supported a new Texas law that bans sanctuary cities: “As governor, our state will respect the rule of law and put the well being of Georgians – not illegal immigrants – first. Greg Abbott, I will fight radical, left-wing organizations and activists who are more concerned with advancing their agenda than keeping citizens and communities safe.” Kemp had earlier praised Gov. </p>

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump came under pressure on Tuesday from U.S. lawmakers, including his fellow Republicans, to explain why he shared highly sensitive intelligence information with senior Russian officials at a meeting in the Oval Office last week. "Something's not happening day after day... McConnell said he’d read the story first reported in The Washington Post, and also said he’d read a statement from H.R. Senator Susan Collins called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to be briefed on the matter, while Bob Corker, head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Monday the allegations were "very, very troubling."</p>

(Alex Brandon, File/Associated Press) WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell downplayed on Tuesday the startling reports that President Donald Trump disclosed highly classified information to a pair of Russian diplomats in the Oval Office. But a number of GOP lawmakers expressed concerns, as Democrats demanded that Republicans finally stand up to their president. McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday responded mildly when asked about the leak story in an interview on Bloomberg Business TV. McConnell said he’d read the story first reported in The Washington Post, and also said he’d read a statement from H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, “which tends to rebut the story.” “I think we could do with a little less drama from the White House on a lot of things,” McConnell said, “so that we can focus on our agenda, which is deregulations, tax reform, repealing and replacing Obamacare.” The events detailed in the explosive Post story occurred days after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the bureau’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties to the Trump campaign. That event was already unsettling Republicans on Capitol Hill, but McConnell’s reaction appeared designed to mute any notion that GOP lawmakers might begin abandoning Trump. “There isn’t anybody who can run the White House without criticism,” Hatch told reporters. “This man has been subject to more criticism than any predecessor that I know of. They hate him, they didn’t like the fact that he won, he beat their favorite, it was a remarkable election.” Other GOP lawmakers, however, were not ready to move on so quickly. In a statement Tuesday, Armed Services Chairman John McCain called the reports that Trump shared sensitive intelligence with Russian officials “deeply disturbing.” “Reports that this information was provided by a U.S. ally and shared without its knowledge sends a troubling signal to America’s allies and partners around the world and may impair their willingness to share intelligence with us in the future,” said McCain, R-Ariz. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, called for an immediate briefing for the Senate Intelligence Committee, of which she is a member. “Although the president has the legal authority to disclose classified information, it would be very troubling if he did share such sensitive reporting with the Russians,” Collins said. Another prominent Republican, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters as the news broke Monday evening that the Trump White House is “in a downward spiral” and has “got to do something soon to bring itself under control and order.” The House has not yet come back into session for the week, but a spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Monday that, “We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation’s secrets is paramount. The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.” Numerous Democrats pointed out that Ryan had called for Democrat Hillary Clinton to be denied classified briefings after Comey concluded last year that she was careless in how she handled classified information over her email accounts and private email server. “If you’ve ever wondered what you’d do if forced to decide between party and country, this is that moment,” No. 2 Senate Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois said in a tweet directed at Ryan. Ryan’s aides countered by pointing out that in the same July 2016 opinion piece where he called for Clinton to be denied classified briefings because of her email practices, Ryan also said those briefings could resume if she were actually elected. One House Republican considered vulnerable in next year’s midterm elections called the “inexplicable stories” from the White House “highly troubling.” Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia said in a statement that Congress should get immediate classified briefings on what occurred “so that Congress can at least know as much as Russian leaders” and the impact on national security. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the Intelligence Committee should have access to transcripts from last week’s Oval Office meeting where Trump reportedly shared details about an Islamic State terror threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. The classified information had been shared with the president by an ally, violating the confidentiality of an intelligence-sharing agreement with that country.

REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev/Lucas Jackson/File Photos Reuters By Susan Cornwell and Susan Heavey WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump came under pressure on Tuesday from U.S. lawmakers, including his fellow Republicans, to explain why he shared highly sensitive intelligence information with senior Russian officials at a meeting in the Oval Office last week. The officials said the information had been supplied by a U.S. ally in the fight against the militant group. The New York Times identified the ally as Israel but two U.S. national security sources said they doubted the report. The disclosure rocked the administration as it struggled to move past the backlash over Trump's abrupt firing on May 9 of FBI Director James Comey, whose agency was investigating potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The Senate Intelligence Committee has asked the White House for more information about reports that Trump gave intelligence information to the Russians, a spokeswoman for the panel said. While not unprecedented, it is a rare privilege for a foreign minister to be granted bilateral talks in the Oval Office with a U.S. president. Moscow's top diplomat, Lavrov represents Russian foreign policies that are often sharply at odds with U.S. aims in Syria and Europe. Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday he had an "absolute right" to share facts with Russia so that it can be more active in fighting Islamic State militants. A U.S. president has the authority to disclose even the most highly classified information at will, but U.S. and allied officials said that by giving information to Russia, Trump had endangered cooperation from an ally that has intelligence on Islamic State. "We need to have immediate classified briefings on what occurred at this meeting so that Congress can at least know as much as Russian leaders and know the impact on our national security, our allies, and our men and women protecting our country," Comstock said in a statement. "Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism." Trump has frequently said he wants to improve U.S. relations with Moscow, damaged by years of disagreement over Russia's role in Ukraine and its backing for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He wasn't briefed on the source and method of the information either," McMaster told reporters. Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Trump's disclosure only reinforced Democrats' call for an independent investigation. </p>
