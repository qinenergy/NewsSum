<p>Federal immigration agents showed up at a Queens elementary school looking for a 4-year-old — but were turned away at the door, officials said Saturday. Citizenship and Immigration Services had no warrant when they arrived at Public School 58 in Maspeth, Queens, officials said. “All students, regardless of immigration status, are welcome in NYC public schools, and parents should rest assured that we will do everything on our power to protect students, staff and families,” said Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña. “We're looking into this incident and are providing schools with additional information on our protocol and more trainings.” Queens lawmaker wants N.Y. courts to curb ICE The incident took place some two months after the city ordered education staffers to bar immigration agents without warrants from entering school buildings. Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña said the city will do everything it can to protect families and students from federal immigration agents. (Kathy Kmonicek/Freelance NYDN) The policy was put in place even though there had been no cases of federal agents seeking to pluck children out of schools. In explaining the move, Mayor de Blasio said he wanted to ease the minds of parents worried about the White House’s stance on undocumented immigrants. “We’re seeing things that we have not seen before and there’s a tremendous amount of fear out there,” de Blasio said. City backs NYPD on immigrants despite charge of alerting ICE “We have to be ready for anything.” More than 140 Customs and Border Protection agents were arrested or convicted of corruption in recent years—and President Trump’s promise to hire 5,500 new agents could make the problem worse. SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Tex.—In the calm waters of the Texas Gulf Coast, Robert Hannan steered his boat toward what he thought was a crab trap. He found a corpse. “There’s nothing that can help this person if it's a real body,” Hannan said in disbelief to the 911 dispatcher. “It's floating just like it would a body, but there’s no head.” That grisly find would lead investigators first to an assassin from the powerful Gulf Cartel, and then to a U.S. Border Patrol agent who helped the killer move drugs and guns across the border. Joel Luna is one of more than 140 Customs and Border Protection agents arrested or convicted on corruption charges in the past dozen years, according to an analysis by the Center for Investigative Reporting and The Texas Tribune. Luna is not one bad apple,” said James Tomsheck, a former senior official at CBP. “He is part of a rate of corruption that exceeded that of any other U.S. federal law-enforcement agency.” Though the number of corrupt agents represents less than 1 percent of CBP’s 44,000 sworn officers—the largest police force in the U.S.—“any amount is bad, and one person alone can do a lot of damage,” John Roth, the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security, told The New York Times. “It doesn’t have to be widespread.” Corrupt officials have given sensitive information to cartels, and waved tons of drugs and thousands of undocumented immigrants through the border in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes. Many operate at official ports of entry, undermining the billions of dollars the government has already spent on fencing, drones, radar, surveillance blimps, agents, and now, perhaps, President Trump’s border wall. Last year, a Department of Homeland Security report found that corrupt border agents are such an urgent problem, they “pose a national security threat,” and called for more aggressive measures to root them out. But CBP may instead relax its standards to meet hiring goals set by Trump in a January executive order that mandates 5,500 new border agents. If the agency does, it risks repeating the mistakes of a previous hiring surge in the mid-2000s, when drug cartels took advantage of lower hiring standards to infiltrate the ranks. More common than infiltrators sent by cartels, however, are agents who go rogue to pay off debt, to help a family member, for sexual favors, or simply for a payday. For Joel Luna, a military veteran who led what looked like a law-abiding life, the trouble seemed to start with his family entanglements, according to Gustavo Garza, the prosecutor who worked on his case. “Whether he did it out of greed or out of love for his family, only he knows,” Garza said. When he arrived on the scene, the victim’s “neck, where his head was cut off, was at the surface of the water,” he later recalled. Ochoa reached under the victim’s arms and hoisted the body onto his boat, only a few hundred feet from the shore of South Padre Island, Texas, a popular spring-break destination for thousands of college students. Some investigators believed that a propeller had cut its head off, but Carlos Garza, the lead investigator for the Cameron County Sheriff’s Department, saw a “clean cut” that made him think it was a homicide. There was also a second cut from the collarbone to the sternum that Garza determined was an unsuccessful attempt “to deflate the body” and keep it from floating. The body was discovered just miles from the Gulf Cartel’s headquarters in Matamoros, Mexico, but local police were unaccustomed to such brutality. “We made an identification on the body.” It was Francisco “Frankie” Palacios Paz, a Honduran immigrant who worked at a tire shop an hour from the beach. At the tire shop, investigators found co-workers who said Frankie “‘went to spring break,’ and that didn’t make a lot of sense to us,” Garza said. Cellphone records showed that the two brothers who co-owned the tire shop exchanged text messages the day Paz disappeared. Paz was involved in drug trafficking with the brothers, who began to worry that he was going to inform on them. * * * Customs and Border Protection traces much its corruption problem to a rapid hiring surge in the years after 9/11. </p>

<p>May 13 (UPI) -- Commuters in New York City made a grim discovery Saturday morning, a dead man on a subway train – the fourth time in as many days police responded to a corpse found in public. Previously, police were called for reports of bodies floating in the Central Park Pond, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir in Central Park and a body hanging from a tree in Riverside Park. Police do not suspect foul play in any of the instances. The previous three are presumed suicides or accidents, investigators said. In Saturday's incident, police said passengers aboard the A train at Brooklyn's Jay Street-Metrotech station discovered the deceased man, identified as Robert Jones, 57. Police said the discovery of bodies floating in the city's rivers and other waterways is not unusual in spring, when currents change after the seasonal thaw. The fact two bodies were found in Central Park in two days is rare, however. "There's no signs of criminality as of now to make this anything other than coincidence," NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said of the first two bodies. "But it is unusual for the park."

<p> We're here to help. The tricky part, for unions at least, is explaining to their members what it means when a fund enters critical status, said Ferguson. America's pension crisis is real — but not as bad as some companies want workers to believe. That’s the main reason we want to convert to a 401(k) plan,” said Rose. It’s also understandable. Neither the Teamsters Local 812 fund or the IBEW Local 3 fund is technically failing — by the government definition of falling into a critical status that means its is severely underfunded. Would you like to chat now? And trying to prevent a company from using that term as a reason to exit a fund. “Usually employers have to put in a little more and certain benefits for those not yet retired are scaled back. Employer contributions to defined benefit plans — the Cadillac of retirement packages once common among workers — are at the center of two labor strikes playing out in New York right now. Local 812’s plan is forecast to grow from $350 million to $500 million over the next decade. According to 2016 financial documents provided by IBEW, its plan is 81% funded and on track to improve. “The math doesn’t add up ...

<p>America's pension crisis is real — but not as bad as some companies want workers to believe. Employer contributions to defined benefit plans — the Cadillac of retirement packages once common among workers — are at the center of two labor strikes playing out in New York right now. The issue lurks in countless other contract negotiations across the state and country — with some employers looking to back-pedal their obligations while unions struggle to hold the line. Catastrophic stories about tanking pension funds — like the demise of the Teamsters Local 707 trust — lend urgency to employers who want to cut their financial liabilities, according to Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center. FDNY EMT injured on job says bureaucracy is dashing pension hopes Local 707 ran out of money after more than a decade of severe funding shortages, leaving its retirees trying to survive on a third of their promised pensions. However, not all such plans — sustained by multiple employers across an industry who pay into a shared pot — are doomed. Yet every time an employer backs out — or goes bankrupt — the strain grows on those who remain, Ferguson noted. “It is common to see companies all across the country trying to get out of multi-employer pension plans and bargain for 401(k) options for workers,” said Ferguson. This is a hard place to be for a company and a hard place to be for a union.” On Long Island, a third-generation family-run beer distributorship is going toe-to-toe with its employees and their union, Teamsters Local 812, over the pension. Clare Rose wants to pull out of the Teamster’s fund, alleging that it’s “critical” status means the future retirement of employees is at risk. “We believe the pension plan is failing and it’s not good for our workers long-term,” Sean Rose, president of the company, told the Daily News in a recent interview. “The math doesn’t add up ... We don’t believe that it’s financially responsible to take care of our employees with a plan that doesn’t seem able to provide the benefits that it’s designed to provide. That’s the main reason we want to convert to a 401(k) plan,” said Rose. (IBEW Local 3) Clare Rose pulling out of the pension fund — which costs them roughly $10,000 a year per employee — was the key issue that pushed its workers out on strike last month, the union said. The company proposed replacing it with a 401(k) with no more than a $1200 per employee annual contribution from the company — although that could still be negotiated higher, Rose said. The defined benefit plan of International Brotherhood of Electrician Workers Local 3 is also a major sticking point in its labor dispute with Charter Communications. Some 1,700 field and cable techs with Charter — parent company of Spectrum-Time Warner Cable — walked off the job nearly seven weeks ago over contribution disagreements for its health and pension funds. Charter said it had offered its techs a pay increase above what the union wanted and “competitive and robust health care and retirement benefits.” The company said it felt it was “more beneficial to our employees than continuing to fund the failing union-managed benefits program.” A spokesman reiterated the company’s position, but added it was willing to keep paying into the fund if necessary. Neither the Teamsters Local 812 fund or the IBEW Local 3 fund is technically failing — by the government definition of falling into a critical status that means its is severely underfunded. “Being critical, or red-zoned, means the fund is required to undertake a rehabilitation plan to keep it solvent going forward,” she said. You have to be in critical status to be able to take the necessary steps to save the plan,” she said. Tom Tolentino, owner of Planet Waste in Maspeth, told The News in March his contract with Local 813 could “bankrupt” his company because of its underfunded pension plan — and that motivated his workers to consider moving to a new union that only offers 401ks. </p>

<p>The president has been quick to spar with the Mexican government, and now they're setting up a pop-up office in his hometown. NY1's Natalie Duddridge has the story from Lower Manhattan. Mexican government officials hosted their first-ever pop-up office at the Metropolitan College of New York on Saturday. It was a chance for Mexican citizens in the city to get free certified copies of their birth certificate; a document that, for many immigrants, can be hard to get. "I have many, many problems before I make the papers for the passport and the ID with the city," one applicant said at the office. Birth certificates are required for most forms of identification and travel documents, including ID NYC cards, as well as to apply for residency and naturalization in the United States. "I needed my birth certificate because I can get my birth certificate for my passport, and I need my passport," immigrant Rosa Pac said. "I have twins, I have small kids, and I want to do the passport for my kids in case something happens. I need every paper to get ready." Officials from Mexico City's Vital Records Office say their concern about the political climate in the U.S. continues to grow. That's why they flew in for the one-day pop-up program; not only to help their citizens living in the city with paperwork, but to also strengthen ties between immigrant organizations in both sanctuary cities. "A lot of the immigrants in New York and around the United States are fearful of arrest and documentation for the pettiest things," community organizer Eddie Borges said. "If they have their birth certificate, they can start building that foundation of paperwork from a library card to a driver's license to be safe and secure in their homes," Borges continued. Officials say that because the information they are collecting at the office is extremely sensitive, all of the data is being destroyed immediately to protect everyone's identities. "It is a moment we're providing personal information that's very sensitive, and that's why people are very careful and they want to be sure they're doing the right thing and giving the information to the proper people," said Marco Castillo of the Mexico City/New York Network. Organizers say they registered at least 200 people, but some undocumented immigrants were too nervous to come in for fear of being exposed. For those who would rather apply for their birth certificate over the phone, they can call 347-460-2187. Maciek Nowak, an associate professor of supply chain management at Loyola’s Quinlan School of Business, likens the business to a dating service for freight: Basically, a 3PL matches shipments with carriers. Robinson doesn’t own trucks, planes, railcars, or ships, but it arranges shipping by all these modes for more than 100,000 companies around the world. It is one of the biggest 3PLs in the country and by some estimates the biggest logistics employer in Chicago, with about 2,000 workers in eight locations in the area. The company is headquartered in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, but the “Chicago Central” office—a low, inconspicuous buff-brick building on the 1800 block of North Marcey, on the industrial western fringe of Lincoln Park—is its biggest and the flagship of its core division: North American Surface Transportation. That means trucking, mostly, and it accounts for about two-thirds of Robinson’s annual revenue, which in 2015 was $13.5 billion. As he moves from screen to screen and phone to phone, Molina switches between English and Spanish: from “Thanks, brother” to “Perfecto, gracias,” from “Atlanta, Georgia” to “Atlonta, Yore-iya.” He can speak Spanish into the phone while typing English into a message. With a click and a tap, he copies a carrier’s number and pastes it into the load editor, then sends a confirmation email to the trucking company. No sooner does Molina finish off that arrangement with his right hand than he punches up a chortling phone line with his left. “EnriqueslinehowcanIhelpyou?” Click, zoom, here’s an email from a trucking company Molina works with regularly: a list of drivers and their hopes for the next few days. And here’s a “load editor” that contains all the information he needs to complete an order: the point of origin, the destination, the contents, the weight, the packaging (boxes? ), the price the customer is paying for the shipment, the amount Molina can offer the carrier, the specified pickup and delivery times. Is there anything special the driver needs to do when he arrives at the loading dock? Dressed in a T-shirt, jeans, and sneakers, he could be a trucker himself, but the rig he’s driving consists of a computer, a cell phone, two desk phones with four incoming lines, and a double monitor on which he is shuffling a bewildering variety of windows. A truck is stuck at a weigh station in South Dakota with a cop who insists the driver doesn’t have the right permit to carry liquids. Molina juggles the calls with an assortment of canned phrases that he speaks so quickly they’re almost unintelligible: “PleaseholdIllberightwithyou.” “ThanksforholdingwhatcanIdoforyou?” In a word, it’s a network. Yet you can stand in the middle of the room, between the shippers and the truckers, and almost feel the stuff of the nation humming through the ether: carrots and beef jerky, steel and elevator parts, candy and sports drinks, furniture, flowers, and footwear—about a billion dollars’ worth of goods every week. And so it goes all day long, the customer reps on one side, the carrier reps on the other, the big-picture guys in the middle, and connecting them all a fast and enormously powerful software platform on which more than 14,000 employees spread over five continents can see the details of any shipment in the system. Robinson deals in invisible things: service and software—or, as the company likes to say, “people, processes, and technology.” Meanwhile, in the middle of the immense room, near where the bosses sit, the “business intelligence group”—a team of 11 analysts, data scientists, and process engineers—sift through crop reports, weather data, economic projections, and the thick veins of information buried in the thousands of orders that Robinson processes each day, looking for trends or problems or developments that might affect the business. A few minutes later, she gets a reply telling her what Robinson would have to pay for the load, based on its carrier contracts. </p>

<p>Katz's Delicatessen has been urging customers to "send a salami to your boy in the Army" for generations. Now, the New York City restaurant, where everyone's favorite scene from "When Harry Met Sally" was shot, is expanding its shipping capacity so it can send perishable delicacies like pastrami and corned beef around the globe.The plan to offer a taste of authentic, old New York by mail is part of an ongoing effort by Katz's young owner to modernize a business that hasn't changed much since it was founded on Manhattan's Lower East Side in 1888. "I can't necessarily replicate the entire experience for you, wherever you are at home," said Jake Dell, 29. "But I can give you the food. I can bring it a little bit closer to you. "A granddaddy of New York City's vanishing Jewish delis, Katz's has become a draw in recent years for tourists looking for bits of the old, immigrant experience in a gentrifying neighborhood where gleaming condo towers are replacing old tenements.And unlike some New York City eateries packed with tourists, it is as popular with foodies as it is with the masses of out-of-towners.Visitors and locals filled the 300-seat restaurant Thursday, polishing off 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) high sandwiches under the gaze of the celebrities whose photos line the walls.

Katz's is also opening a takeout-only outpost in Brooklyn's new DeKalb Market Hall next month. Katz's, lucky to own its building in a city where rent increases have a habit of putting even iconic spots out of business, also recently gave itself a financial cushion by selling off adjoining properties and air rights to a condominium developer.

<p>The AP compiled the data amid an emerging philosophical split in the school-choice movement. The move toward broadening alternatives to struggling district schools has largely been underwritten by some of the country's wealthiest people, including Betsy DeVos, whom President Donald Trump elevated to U.S. education secretary. While donors include those who support charter schools, which are public schools but privately run, DeVos and others want to take choice further with programs like vouchers that allow tax money to pay for private school tuition and government-funded scholarships. Bloomberg declined to comment on his support of the Massachusetts ballot initiative, or whether he favors vouchers or other choice programs beyond charter schools. In all, the former mayor's political contributions to school choice initiatives from 2007-2016 represent a fraction of his more than $76 million in contributions to various candidates and causes, the analysis found.

Whereas President Donald Trump and his emissaries negotiated legislation directly with House members, needled the House leadership on when to schedule votes and publicly surmised about the GOP’s whip counts in support of the bill, the White House seems to place more trust in McConnell. That’s in part because the Senate’s outsized characters and ambitious members do not enjoy being dictated to by the White House. Republican sources on Monday said it could take until the August recess to figure out what can win the support 50 of the GOP's 52 senators and pass muster with the Senate’s strict budgetary ‘reconciliation’ rules that allow Obamacare to be scaled back by a majority vote. Senators are likely to call for less severe Medicaid cuts and more generous tax credits for insurance markets, as well as to significantly alter the House’s attempts to give states waivers for some of Obamacare’s insurance requirements. </p>

10:20 a.m.

France’s President-elect Emmanuel Macron has arrived at the Elysee presidential palace for his inauguration ceremony. (On the move!). Macron formally took power after his predecessor, Socialist Francois Hollande, met with him for one hour and left. Macron had been Hollande’s top economy adviser at the Elysee from 2012 to 2014, then became his economy minister until last year, when he decided to quit the Socialist government and launch his independent presidential bid. His Republic on the Move movement hopes to reinvigorate French politics and win a majority of lawmakers in the June parliamentary election. During the solemn ceremony, Macron and Hollande stood in silence as the national anthem  La Marseillaise  and the unofficial anthem of the French Resistance  the Partisans Song  were played to commemorate the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. As is tradition, the pair laid a wreath of flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier, commemorating the millions who perished during both World War I (1914-18) and World War II (1939-45). He was loudly applauded by the employees of the French presidency at his departure. Macron then posed for photographers at the front porch of the Elysee with his wife, Brigitte. Sundays second and final round of voting was marked by a high rate of abstention at 25.44 percent and some 11.47 percent of voters turned out to cast a spoiled or blank ballot.</p>

(Petr David Josek/Associated Press) PARIS — The Latest on the inauguration of French President Emmanuel Macron (all times local): 1:30 p.m. France’s freshly inaugurated President Emmanuel Macron is paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier beneath the Napoleonic triumphal arch in a highly symbolic ceremony. After Macron was formally declared president Sunday in the Elysee Palace, 21 cannon shots were fired from across the Seine River at the Invalides monument, where Napoleon is entombed. Macron then walked alone across the cobblestones of the Champs-Elysees avenue to the Arc de Triomphe, where he lay a wreath and re-ignited the flame at the tomb of the unknown soldier. France’s youngest-ever president and new commander-in-chief waved to supporters taking selfies and greeted veterans and military officers in formation beneath the arch.

Hollande defended his unpopular presidency in a series of tweets minutes after leaving the Elysee presidential palace in the hands of his successor and protege, Emmanuel Macron. The messages were directed at members of his once-powerful Socialist Party, which is now on the verge of a collapse. Hollande vaunted his efforts to produce the Paris Agreement on fighting climate change, legalizing gay marriage in France and doing “everything possible to ensure that Greece stays in Europe.” He tweeted that “we lived through crises but we held together. France remained France.” ___ 12:01 p.m. New French President Emmanuel Macron says he will do everything that is necessary to fight terrorism and authoritarianism and to resolve the world’s migration crisis.

<p>(CNN) North Korea carried out a provocative new ballistic missile test early Sunday, sending a projectile to a higher altitude and closer to Russia than any of its recent tests, according to officials. A missile launched near the city of Kusong, in western North Korea, flew across the country and into the Sea of Japan/East Sea, hitting the water about 60 miles from Vladivostok in eastern Russia, according to US officials. Japan's Defense Ministry said the missile reached an altitude of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) and flew for 30 minutes. "It is possibly a new type of missile," Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada said. The high altitude and longer flight time indicate a missile with an extended range, according to David Wright, co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Writing on his organization's blog , Wright pointed out that If the missile did reach that height and fly that long, it could reach the US territory of Guam in the Pacific. Guam is home to Andersen Air Force Base, through which the US Air Force rotates heavy bombers including B-1s, B-2s and B-52s. Sunday's missile test "points to a new threshold of capability potentially crossed," said Euan Graham, an expert on North Korea at Australia's Lowy Institute. Tong Zhao, an analyst with the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, said if the missile does have the range to hit Guam, it could give North Korea "a regional nuclear deterrence," meaning it might not need to pursue an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) which could reach the US mainland. But Graham said it could be a stepping stone to just that. North Korean engineers "may well be able to draw warhead re-entry data from that which is applicable to their ICBM ambitions," he said. Russia responded to North Korea's test by putting its far eastern air defenses on high alert, according to a report from the RIA-Novosti news agency. "We cannot fail to understand that the territory of Russia is not only an object for attack but also a place where a missile may fall. In order to protect ourselves from possible incidents, we will keep our air defense systems in the Far East in a state of increased combat readiness," Viktor Ozerov, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security, is quoted as saying. Sunday's test is the first from North Korea since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office last week. Moon said the missile test violates UN Security Council resolutions and called it a severe challenge to the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula and the world, presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan said. South Korea needs to show the North that even though talks are possible, it will only be possible if North Korea changes its attitude, the President told staff. The direction of the missile, so close to Russia, was likely an attempt by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to send a message to both Moscow and Beijing, said Carl Schuster, a Hawaii Pacific University professor and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center. "It tells Russia, 'I can touch you too,'" Schuster said. "It tells China, 'I don't care what you think, I'm independent,'" he said. China remains one of North Korea's only allies and is responsible for much of the heavily-sanctioned nation's economy. On Sunday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping launched a major trade and infrastructure summit with multiple world leaders in Beijing. "The timing is not coincidental," Schuster said, adding that Kim may be trying to get Putin more involved in the situation on the Korean Peninsula. "It's his way of telling the Russians, 'You need to speak up,'" and stop US-supported international sanctions on North Korea, Schuster said. JUST WATCHED North Korea's ominous show of force Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH North Korea's ominous show of force 03:02 The United States called for repercussions from the international community. "With the missile impacting so close to Russian soil -- in fact, closer to Russia than to Japan -- the President cannot imagine that Russia is pleased," the statement said. "Let this latest provocation serve as a call for all nations to implement far stronger sanctions against North Korea," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement. All sides should exercise restraint and refrain from taking actions that would further escalate tensions in the region," a statement from China's Foreign Ministry said. Though tensions between the United States and North Korea have been higher than usual over the past few months, a senior North Korean diplomat told South Korea's Yonhap news agency on Saturday that Pyongyang is open to talks with Washington "under the right conditions." Earlier this month, Trump said he would be willing to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un "under the right circumstances." FUSSA, Japan — Residents living near U.S. military bases in Japan are facing a fresh reality: Their neighborhoods are on the frontline of North Korea's dispute with America and if Pyongyang were to attack they would have just minutes to shelter from incoming missiles. A possible missile strike and what to do about it have dominated TV talk shows and other media in Japan in recent weeks as regional tension has spiked, with the North Korean regime continuing to test-fire rockets and President Donald Trump sending an aircraft carrier to nearby waters in a show of force. While Japanese tabloids and television programs have reported on nuclear shelters ordered by a handful of rich people or touted gas masks as a more affordable option, it's largely business as usual in Fussa, a town of 58,000 people in Tokyo's western suburbs. </p>

<p>Veterans of past White House scandals from Watergate to Plamegate have an important message for Team Trump: It’s time to think about lawyering up. In the past week, a Senate committee began issuing subpoenas in its investigation into Russian contacts with President Donald Trump’s staff and other associates during the 2016 election campaign and transition, while the FBI continues its own criminal investigation. Trump himself fired FBI director James Comey, and then said in the aftermath of that decision that the Russia probe was “made up” and appeared to threaten Comey on Twitter. Story Continued Below “There’s obviously a risk here,” said Washington white-collar defense attorney Robert Luskin. “And that’s not any kind of judgment on [Trump’s] personal integrity or absence of it, but the apparent fact he doesn’t seem to be very sensitive about norms and about risks.” It’s an axiom of Washington scandals that the cover-up tends to be worse than the crime—and it’s lower- or mid-level people who wind up getting caught in the worst legal trouble, usually for tangential offenses like perjury or obstruction of justice. The ancillary stuff, like a forgotten meeting or a discarded document, can cause the most serious problems for staffers navigating the unfamiliar, expensive and high-stakes world of grand juries, subpoenas and congressional hearings, where the prospects of perjury or obstruction of justice charges can be filed for both unintended slip-ups or intentional attempts to cover up for a superior. “The thing you worry about in a process like that is you just make a mistake and it appears more than it is,” said Rep. Sean Maloney, a New York Democratic lawmaker who served as staff secretary for President Bill Clinton during his final two years at the White House amid congressional impeachment proceedings. If someone asks you questions for two or three hours it’s easy to make a mistake.” At least some of the people who joined the Trump administration were aware of the legal risks. “I had folks who joined the administration ask that question, which should tell you something,” said Luskin, who previously represented President George W. Bush’s senior political adviser Karl Rove during the investigation into the leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame’s identity, as well as a pair of senior officials during the probe of Clinton’s Whitewater land deals. A few of the central players in the Trump investigations already have counsel. Former campaign manager Paul Manafort, whose work in Ukraine is under review, has a lawyer, as does former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, who last week was served with a subpoena by the Senate Intelligence Committee. Their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment. Longtime personal Trump tax attorneys from the firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius sent Senate investigators a letter last week detailing some of the president’s business interests tied to Russia. A spokeswoman from the firm declined comment. John Dean, the former Nixon White House counsel who went to prison for four months because of his role in Watergate, said he didn’t expect Trump’s staffers at this early stage of the investigative process to have already started hiring attorneys.

He predicted the lower-level employees, including otherwise innocent secretaries and other aides who have gotten up-close interactions with the president and his senior aides, may not see the need to call for an attorney until they’ve been identified as potential witnesses. “They’re primarily driven by fear, fear of the unknown and not wanting to make a mistake,” he said. But Dean added that some people delay retaining counsel because they think it makes them look bad. “They don’t want to either admit it in their own mind or they think they can tough it out. And that’s foolish.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment about whether individual staffers have retained counsel. “The entire White House staff is hard at work implementing the president’s agenda for the American people,” said press secretary Sean Spicer. Outside observers say the signs are growing that Trump’s staff may want to start lining up legal advice, even if it’s only for preliminary discussions. “If they have information that indicates contact with Russians or attempts to interfere they better damn well,” said former FBI agent Lewis Schiliro, who spent 25 years at the FBI before retiring in 2000 as head of the New York field office. “That’s a pretty serious thing.” Along with the criminal subpoenas, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz last week requested the Justice Department inspector general examine Trump’s firing of FBI director Comey; the Treasury Department is reportedly going to be sharing records with Senate investigators on Trump’s financial dealings with Russia and beyond; and calls keep coming from Capitol Hill Democrats to the White House to retain all documents related to ongoing criminal probes. “I don’t know how they’re getting anything done, including the people who are much lower down and have jobs with nothing to do with this,” said Amanda Kane, a former associate counsel in the Obama White House. “It’s a very small, insular environment there.” But others said that an investigation can sometimes serve as a rallying point for staffers. “What really gets you through is the relationships with your colleagues,” said Maloney. Last week, his press aides opened their daily briefings talking about an executive order on cybersecurity and his government’s response to an accident at the nuclear waste cleanup side in Hanford, Washington. As Luskin put it: “I have to say compared to the Clinton years that this is a walk in a f------ park.”  Authors: As you may have heard, an investigation of possible links between Donald Trump's campaign and Russia is currently underway, and the president is not handling it very well. Then, after White House aides and Vice-President Mike Pence put out the line that Trump cut Comey loose on the recommendation of deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and attorney general Jeff Sessions, Trump told NBC News that, actually, he was going to can the guy “regardless,” and his third-person thinking at the time was “this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,” which doesn’t exactly jibe with the initial claim that the axing had to do with the director’s handling of the Hillary e-mail situation. On Friday, Trump who, as a reminder, is a sitting president, logged on to Twitter and told his 29.2 million followers that “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” (Comey reportedly “hopes there are tapes,” as “that would be perfect.”) What probably should have happened next is that Donald Trump and everyone related to Donald Trump—by blood or through the White House—should have just stopped talking, taken Friday off, and headed to Bedminster.

The Struggle Over Religious Authority in Post-2013 Egypt

Egyptian regimes have steered religion in the public realm, but have habitually done so in an unsteady manner. Moreover, the definition of what is deemed political can itself be very political. Officials at the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs have suggested that Oman could serve as a model for other countries struggling with sectarian tensions and violent extremism. But they are often challenged. And here the sheikh of Al-Azhar was able to outmaneuver the minister. There is nothing about [the Islamic State], as the grand mufti of Saudi Arabia said, or the council that issues fatwas said, nothing whatsoever about [the Islamic State] that is related to Islam. But these levers of control are difficult to use with precision. Religious establishments are complex structures with broader agendas, some of which may not be that closely aligned with what international actors pursue. However, the effectiveness of the messages was limited. Yet they did so in very different ways. That is why the religious establishment is a pillar of the regime. 15 Personal conversation, Cairo, 2016. The aim of this process of legal reform was twofold.

<p> Several mummies were recently found at a newly discovered burial site unveiled Saturday in Egypt. Virtually every week, it seems, new aspects of Egypt’s history are being unearthed. The country’s antiquities ministry announced Saturday that at least 17 well-preserved mummies were found in a necropolis in the village of Tuna al-Gabal, about 135 miles south of the capital, Cairo. The discovery surprised many because the ancient burial site on the fringes of the western desert was mainly known as an area where thousands of mummified birds and animals had been discovered over the years. “It’s the first human necropolis to be found here in Tuna al-Gabal,” Egypt’s antiquities minister Khaled al-Anani told reporters at the site. "2017 has been a historic year for archaeological discoveries." Seventeen mummies uncovered in central Egypt https://t.co/ekP74ky18X pic.twitter.com/cllfGGxAFE — Al Jazeera News (@AJENews) May 14, 2017 Judging from their elaborate preservation, the mummies likely belonged to officials or priests, he added. Also found at the site were six limestone and clay sarcophagi, two clay coffins and a number of other artifacts, Anani said. The discoveries likely date back to the Greco-Roman period, which lasted for nearly six centuries after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 BC. Among the new treasures: a dozen cemeteries that date back around 3,500 years, the ancient tomb of a nobleman that could be more than 3,000 years old and a giant colossus believed to portray King Psammetichus I, who ruled in the sixth century BC. "Colossus found in Egypt may have depicted Psammetich I" https://t.co/xpSbUiBSo9 — hockey schtick (@hockeyschtick1) May 3, 2017 Even Cairo’s crowded neighborhoods have proved fruitful arenas for new discoveries. In March, a German-Egyptian archaeological team uncovered a 26-foot-tall statue believed to be of Ramses the Great, who ruled more than 3,000 years ago and is widely considered ancient Egypt’s most powerful ruler. Last Tuesday, the antiquities ministry announced the finding of a 3,700-year-old burial chamber near the remains of a recently discovered pyramid at Dashur, south of Cairo. The chamber is likely belongs to a daughter of King Emnikamaw, and contained a wooden box engraved with hieroglyphs, said the ministry. Last month, archaeologists found more ancient artifacts at Dashur, where the pharaoh Sneferu built Egypt’s first smooth-sided pyramid about 4,600 years ago. His son Khufu built the Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the country’s best-known tourist attractions and a wonder of the ancient world.

The tourism sector, a vital source of hard currency, has struggled to recover since the country’s populist revolts of 2011 ousted President Hosni Mubarak, triggering political turmoil. Since then, a string of factors have kept many tourists away, including a slew of militant attacks, punctuated by the bombing of a Russian passenger plane in 2015, as well as attacks and abuses by Egypt’s own security forces. Tourism Minister Yehia Rashed said last month, according to Reuters, that the new finds could raise tourism levels to about 10 million, an improvement from the 9.3 million visitors that came in 2015 but still far below the 14.7 million from 2010. Meanwhile, the work continues at Tuna Al-Gabal, where Egyptian officials predict much bigger discoveries remain to be found. All Arab states have large, official Muslim religious establishments that give governments a major role in religious life. Through them, the state has a say over religious education, mosques, and religious broadcasting—turning official religious institutions into potent policy tools. However, the complexity of the religious landscape means they are rarely mere regime mouthpieces and it can be difficult to steer them in a particular direction. Religious Institutions in the Arab World Official religious institutions in the Arab world, though generally loyal to their countries’ regimes, are vast bureaucracies whose size and complexity allow them some autonomy. Arab regimes hold sway over official religious structures. However, their ability to bend these religious institutions to suit their own purposes is mixed. The evolution of official religious establishments is rooted substantially in the process of modern state formation. Increasingly, the authority of official religious voices has been challenged by unofficial actors. Some of these actors stand wholly outside official structures, but others may find shelter in more autonomous parts of official religious institutions, adding to the complexity of the religious landscape in many countries. However, religious officials have limited ideological tools to confront radical Islamists, and their priorities are different than those of actors from outside the region. By allowing official religious institutions some autonomy, regimes can enhance their monitoring ability and the integrity of religious officials. Western states should know the size and complexity of religious institutions means they are not always effective at fighting extremism as Western actors may wish. However, by placing unrealistic expectations on what regimes and their establishments can and are willing to deliver, and by replicating an often self-defeating strategy of relying on authoritarian controls to combat nonconformist movements and ideas, this approach may offer only the illusion of a solution. All three of these descriptions contain a germ of truth. Their authority is often contested by individuals and organizations outside of the state, but these bureaucracies are present in many different realms. </p>

Former Pope Benedict set up a commission of theologians and bishops to study the situation.

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE Pope Francis has voiced serious doubt about the authenticity of alleged continuing apparitions of the Madonna in Medjugorje, a once-obscure village in Bosnia boosted by the pilgrim business. "Who thinks that the Madonna says, 'Come tomorrow at this time, and at such time I will deliver a message to that visionary?'"

REUTERS/Tiziana Fabi/Pool ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE Pope Francis has voiced serious doubt about the authenticity of alleged continuing apparitions of the Madonna in Medjugorje, a once-obscure village in Bosnia boosted by the pilgrim business. "These presumed apparitions don't have a lot of value. This I say as a personal opinion," he told reporters on his plane returning on Saturday night from Portugal where he gave the Catholic Church two new child saints. [L8N1IF0M1] Six children first reported visions of the Virgin Mary in 1981 in a scenario reminiscent of famous apparitions in the French town of Lourdes in the 19th century and 100 years ago in Fatima, which Francis visited on Friday and Saturday. In the following years, the Bosnian village became a major pilgrimage site, giving many visitors a renewed sense of spirituality and locals a steady source of much-needed revenue. It also became the focus of controversy as local Franciscan priests running the site promoted their claims in such open defiance of warnings from the Vatican that some were expelled from the order and the local bishop called them schismatic. Some of the alleged visionaries, now adults, say they still experience apparitions regularly, and that the Madonna tells them ahead of time when she will appear to them. Former Pope Benedict set up a commission of theologians and bishops to study the situation. Its report has not been published but was given to Pope Francis in 2014. Francis said investigations are continuing into the first alleged apparitions when the reported visionaries were children or teenagers, but again made it clear that he is highly sceptical about today's claims. I prefer the Madonna as mother, our mother, and not a Madonna who is the head of a telegraph office, who every day sends a message at such-and-such an hour. "Who thinks that the Madonna says, 'Come tomorrow at this time, and at such time I will deliver a message to that visionary?'" But Francis acknowledged that some people who go to Medjugorje experience a spiritual renewal and "encounter God, change their lives." Francis provided the first-ever details about the contentious process that has been under way for years to determine whether the Catholic Church should describe the Medjugorje visions as authentic. He was asked to comment en route home from the Catholic shrine at Fatima, Portugal, where he commemorated the anniversary of the visions of the Madonna reported by three shepherd children 100 years ago Saturday. Unlike Fatima or Lourdes, France, the Medjugorge phenomenon has never been declared authentic, in part because the local bishops have long cast doubt on the reliability and interests of the "seers." Francis said he knew he was being "naughty" in doubting the Medjugorje phenomenon, in which six youngsters reported seeing visions of the Madonna starting in 1981. Some have reported continuous visions ever since, with precise messages being delivered at pre-designated times, drawing skepticism that their claims were aimed more at bringing religious tourists to the otherwise unremarkable rural spot in southern Bosnia. Francis said the key of the Vatican investigation is to distinguish between the original visions in 1981 and the current claims. He said it called for further study of the original apparitions, expressed doubt about the continuing visions, and noted there were nevertheless spiritual goods coming from the shrine itself. Francis said he only learned about Mueller's intervention after the fact, late on a Saturday night. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump’s tax lawyers issued a statement on Friday that the White House wants you to take seriously: The president has not received income or taken on any debt or equity from Russian sources over the past 10 years, “with a few exceptions.” This is not how you construct a credible statement about someone’s finances, let alone a sitting president of the United States. “With few exceptions” is such an obvious out that it can barely even be called a loophole ― it simply and openly invalidates the denial that precedes it. Trump has a history of emphatically denying that he has any monetary connection to Russia. In January, he tweeted: “NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!” His lawyers’ new admission of the “few exceptions” indicates this blanket denial was false. According to Dillon and Nelson, those exceptions include Russian fertilizer kingpin Dmitry Rybolovlev purchasing a South Florida mansion for $95 million in 2008; the 2013 Miss Universe contest held in Moscow, which earned $12.2 million in income; and “ordinary course sales of goods or services to Russians.” No documentary evidence was provided to prove that these are Trump’s only sources of income from Russians. “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,” Donald Trump Jr. said at a Russian real estate conference in 2008. “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.” And a sports writer recently reported that Eric Trump, another son of the president, said in 2014 that the family had access to $100 million from Russian banks. “Well, we don’t rely on American banks,” Eric Trump said at the time, according to the writer. Russians spent nearly $100 million to purchase condos in seven buildings licensing the Trump name in South Florida, according to Reuters. Trump received a commission on all sales in the buildings, likely somewhere between 1 percent and 4 percent. This would mean Trump received between $1 million and $4 million in income from Russian purchasers. Bayrock provided the financing to build Trump Soho, which the company owned and Trump lent his name to through a licensing deal. Bayrock was founded by Tevfik Arif, a former Soviet official who was born in Kazakhstan, and Tamir Sapir, a Georgian fertilizer and oil magnate. Bayrock attempted to build Trump-branded buildings in Arizona and Florida and had offices for a time in Trump Tower. Sater was given a Trump Organization business card, which called him a “senior advisor to Donald Trump.” Sater traveled to Russia with Trump’s children looking for investment properties. Despite these numerous connections, Trump said in 2013 that if Sater “were sitting in the room right now, I wouldn’t know what he looked like.” It’s unclear where Bayrock got the money to finance Trump Soho, because the funding trail ends with an Icelandic company called FL Group. Allen Garten, a Trump Organization lawyer, told the Financial Times last year that he “had no reason to question” where Bayrock got its money. Additionally, HuffPost reported a previously unknown connection between Donald Trump Jr. and Sater through a company called Global Habitat Solutions. Of course, the president could provide evidence for his claims by releasing his personal tax returns and the returns for his family business, but he has refused to do so. Without producing his full tax returns, the only thing we have to reply on to substantiate Trump’s denials is Trump’s word. Without documentation for his and his lawyers’ claims, statements about where Trump’s income comes from and who his family does business with cannot be taken seriously. “This is a bizarre attempt to substitute a prepared communication for public disclosure, which is insufficient for both urgent investigation and repairing the public trust,” John Wonderlich, executive director of the pro-transparency Sunlight Foundation, told HuffPost. Quincy attorney Tom Kiley, whose client list has included a long line of pols, has launched a ballot question committee whose purpose is to require candidates to make public copies of their tax returns in order to qualify for the ballot. Attention, however, continues to swirl around Trump, whose refusal to release full copies of his tax returns has raised serious ethical questions as his administration pushes its own set of tax reforms. You may recall the Brockton lawmaker caught her share of headlines in late March when she posted on Facebook warning constituents of potential federal immigration raids in the city. She then sought to raise funds off the kerfuffle, asking supporters to donate via PayPal to “fight back” against the criticisms she received. That move quickly prompted a complaint from the conservative Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, which called on the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance to probe whether she violated state law. Produce the replies by this Friday, campaign finance officials told her in a letter, or risk refunding or purging the donations. </p>

<p> Authorities say Wendi Wright, 35, tried to force a congressman’s car off the road for voting on the Republican health-care bill. (Weakley County Sheriff’s Department) A Tennessee woman hated that her congressman voted for the controversial Republican health-care bill in the House of Representatives, authorities said. So Wendi L. Wright tried to run Rep. David Kustoff (R-Tenn.) off the road after he visited the University of Tennessee at Martin, they said. At some point, the congressman and his aide became afraid and worried that Wright wanted to force them off the road. They then turned into a driveway and stopped. That’s where Wright got out, screamed at the congressman and struck the windows of his vehicle, even reaching inside the car, the sheriff’s department said. Authorities said Wright then stood in front of the vehicle to try to keep Kustoff from leaving.

[‘Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care,’ GOP lawmaker says. Wright, 35, has been charged with felony reckless endangerment and was released after posting a $1,000 bond.

Kustoff speaks with supporters at his victory party after he won the race in Tennessee’s 8th Congressional District on Nov. 8, 2016 in Memphis. At the time of the vote, the Congressional Budget Office had not analyzed the bill’s cost and impact on coverage, but the agency’s analysis of its original version that 24 million would lose insurance by 2026. The estimate also showed that the bill would cut $880 billion from the Medicaid program over the next decade. The bill includes an amendment that would allow states to obtain a waiver so they could charge customers with preexisting conditions more than other people. Another amendment that would provide $8 million over five years to lower premiums for those with preexisting conditions swayed some concerned moderate Republicans to support the bill, allowing the House GOP leadership to secure enough votes to pass it. Democrats, however, say the $8 billion is not enough and those with preexisting conditions will face the choice of paying exorbitant premiums or carrying no insurance. In a statement after voting for the bill, Kustoff said: “We promised the American people we would repeal and replace Obamacare, and today, the House voted to keep our word and provide relief … This bill would protect and ensure access to care for those with preexisting conditions, and moreover, it will make health care more attainable with lower premiums.” Kustoff’s office has not publicly addressed the incident.

<p> Trump is innocent. Trump, though, has some alternative facts. "Have you heard that expression used before?" It's no different with taxes. Never mind that they wouldn't need those deductions as much when they'd be paying a much lower rate. “No one use it,” McCarthy declared. Trump seems to think that just saying his plan keeps his promises — such as having "insurance for everybody" — is the same thing as actually keeping them. Asked about Trump’s connections to Russia, McCarthy-as-Spicer responded: “Let me just put this whole Russia thing to bed. Host Melissa McCarthy delivered a lengthy sketch spoofing the travails of White House press secretary Sean Spicer. “In an upcoming episode we will find out that Kellyanne (Conway) has been dead this whole time.”

When pressed by Holt about his choice to replace Comey, Trump vowed that it will be someone “so bonkers you’re going to wish like hell it was Judge Judy.”

Che’s Holt pressed Trump on the reason for firing Comey. I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good." Because he told us so. “If he’s crazy, he’s crazy like a fox with mental problems,” McCarthy said. Alec Baldwin was back as President Trump in “Saturday Night Live’s” cold open, parrying with Michael Che in a spoof of this week’s much-publicized interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt. Trump just repeats that his plans will be great for everybody, that more and more people love it, and, impossible as it sounds, that it's getting better and better all the time.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump thinks he invented a term "a couple of days ago" that he has been using for months and that economists have for more than a century, and it wasn't even the least accurate thing he said in his latest interview. Now, everyone is understandably laughing at Trump's history of the phrase "priming the pump." That, of course, is the long-standing idea that the government should fight recessions by cutting taxes and increasing spending. It really entered the lexicon in the 1930s — that's the first time the Economist used the term — but it goes back to at least 1916. "Have you heard that expression used before?" I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good." First off, Trump's question doesn't make any sense on its own terms. And second, how could he think he just coined it when he used the very words "priming the pump" back in March and December? But the bigger point is that Trump doesn't show any more ability to distinguish fact from fan fiction when it comes to his policies, either. He said in the interview, for example, that his health-care plan means that "we're going to have much lower premiums, and we're going to have much lower deductibles." The Brookings Institution, for one, estimates that on an apples-to-apples basis — holding the generosity of insurance plans and the age of the insurance pool constant — Trumpcare would actually increase premiums by 13 percent. And the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says that it would increase the average deductible by $1,550. Not to mention the 24 million people the Congressional Budget Office says would lose coverage mostly as a result of the bill's big cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's subsidies. Trump seems to think that just saying his plan keeps his promises — such as having "insurance for everybody" — is the same thing as actually keeping them. Trump has claimed that he will "massively" cut taxes for the middle class, but even the most generous analyses conclude the opposite — he'd help the rich much more than anybody else. But Trump brushed this concern aside when the Economist brought it up by simply saying "I don't believe that," since top earners would lose a lot of deductions under his plan. Never mind that they wouldn't need those deductions as much when they'd be paying a much lower rate. Trump just repeats that his plans will be great for everybody, that more and more people love it, and, impossible as it sounds, that it's getting better and better all the time. If you want more detail than that ... well, did he mention that it's great? This is the kind of thing that only works as long as your plans haven't passed. Because once they do, there's no hiding from the fact that what you said would happen is the opposite of what is actually happening. He might be too busy coming up with new economic terms such as "tax cut" and, um, "cutting taxes." The opening sketch lobbed several zingers at Trump, including a risque reference to Trump’s claim to have coined the phrase “priming the pump.” Baldwin’s Trump insisted that it was a description of his need to “tug at myself for about a half an hour before Melania comes in so she can find it easier.” The cold open incorporated numerous headlines from another eventful week for the Trump administration, from the firing of FBI director James Comey to the revelation that the President likes two scoops of ice cream for dessert. Among Baldwin’s best lines from the sketch: “Some people have called me a serial tapist — when you’re President they let you do that.” “I sit on every chair like it’s a toilet.” “Nothing’s going to stop me because I have the Republicans in the palm of my hand.” Referring to his presidency as a TV show, he vowed it will run for eight years. “In an upcoming episode we will find out that Kellyanne (Conway) has been dead this whole time.” When pressed by Holt about his choice to replace Comey, Trump vowed that it will be someone “so bonkers you’re going to wish like hell it was Judge Judy.” Che’s Holt pressed Trump on the reason for firing Comey. The segment began with McCarthy-as-Spicer hiding in the bushes outside the window, with Sanders (Aidy Bryant) filling in at the podium, and the press corps begging her to stay on. They’re going to prove it with a certified letter.” McCarthy then read off the tracking numbers — only then to realize it was his own bank routing number. Spicer arrived at Trump Tower, only to be told by the doormen that Trump doesn’t come there anymore. He finally finds Baldwin-as-Trump at a golf course in New York, and asks the burning question: “Have you ever told me to say things that aren’t true?” Replies Trump, “Only since you started working here.” Trump reassures Spicer that he won’t replace him with Sanders (“She doesn’t have your special spice”). </p>

<p>At Liberty, Trump Calls Critics 'Pathetic,' Praises Putting 'Faith Into Action' Enlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP For his first commencement speech as president, Donald Trump went back to a place that was once key to his efforts as a candidate to shore up support among the Republican base. Standing before tens of thousands of members of the Class of 2017 and their families at Liberty University's open-air stadium in Lynchburg, Va., Trump thanked the crowd for helping him achieve the presidency. "I wanna thank you because, boy, did you come out and vote — those of you that are old enough; in other words, your parents," Trump said. "Boy, oh boy, you voted. A strong majority of evangelicals voted for Trump in November despite some predictions to the contrary. Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr., was one of the first leading white evangelical figures to endorse Trump during the Republican primary season, though that decision wasn't universally supported at his university. In his speech, Trump jokingly nodded to the difficult odds he'd once faced. "Right here, the Class of 2017, dressed in cap and gown, graduating to a totally brilliant future; and here I am, standing before you as president of the United States. So I'm guessing there are some people here today who thought that either one of those things — either one — would really require major help from God," Trump said, drawing laughter and applause from the crowd. Trump bypassed more traditional options for a first presidential commencement speech, like the University of Notre Dame, instead sending Vice President Mike Pence. As graduation speeches go, Trump struck familiar themes: he urged students to be persistent, follow their passions and chart their own paths in life. He occasionally sounded self-reflective as he imparted wisdom to the graduates. "I've seen so many people, they're forced through lots of reasons — sometimes including family — to go down a path that they don't want to go down, to go down a path that leads then to something that they don't love, that they don't enjoy," Trump said. "You have to do what you love, or you most likely won't be very successful at it." Trump also seemed to allude several times to the 2016 campaign — advising students to claim the label of "outsider" and not be discouraged by naysayers. "The more that a broken system tells you that you're wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead, you must keep pushing forward," Trump said. "And always have the courage to be yourself." Enlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP The president's speech included plenty of language tailored to the conservative Christian audience. He alluded to his recent executive order billed as protecting religious freedom, though some critics said the language actually changes very little. "America is better when people put their faith into action," Trump said. "As long as I am president, no one is ever going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what's in your heart." Trump's visit to this bastion of support came after a tumultuous week in which he fired FBI Director James Comey and faced questions about whether the timing of the firing could be related to an ongoing investigation into possible ties between his campaign and Russian officials — after a determination by the U.S. intelligence community that Russia had meddled in the election to help Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton. He steered clear of that subject, making only sidelong swipes at his critics. "No one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it can't be done," Trump said. "Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they're people that can't get the job done." Falwell, Jr., praised Trump's first few months in office, pointing to Trump's selection of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, his decision to stack his Cabinet with religious conservatives and what Falwell described as bombing "those in the Middle East who are persecuting and killing Christians." Falwell said he's pleased with Trump's performance so far. "I do not believe that any president in our lifetimes has done so much that has benefited the Christian community in such a short time span than Donald Trump," he said. Enlarge this image toggle caption Sarah McCammon/NPR Sarah McCammon/NPR Several Liberty graduates and their families said they felt much the same. Lanora Hale came from Millville, N.J., to watch her son graduate with a master's degree. Hale said she's solidly behind Trump. Hale said she wants to see a tighter connection between religion and government — perhaps prayer in public schools — and she sees Trump as friendly toward that goal. "I really am glad that he's putting God back into everything," she said. "[I want] to bring Christ back into our nation and into our schools, since we don't have him in schools rights now; it's just silent prayers," she said, "I would love to see the prayers back into schools because it makes a big difference." For Josh Kirkland of Pensacola, Fla., graduating with a bachelor's degree in cinema, it was an "honor" to have the president speak at commencement. I would say ladies and gentlemen. </p>

<p> For one, Rubin said, the data that they have is incredibly time-sensitive, making them most susceptible to ransomware. It was still unclear who was behind the sophisticated attack. The researcher behind "Malware Tech" sent the virus down a "sinkhole," preventing it from spreading more widely. [The Switch: Update your Windows systems now. The attack was notable because it took advantage of a security flaw in Microsoft software found by the National Security Agency for its surveillance tool kit. Europol confirmed Sunday that computer networks in more than 150 countries and more than 200,000 people had been affected by one of the biggest cybersecurity attacks in recent history. Poorer hospitals are particularly vulnerable. That work is still ongoing,” Rudd told the BBC. One reason Russia may have been hit so hard is the use of outdated software by government agencies. Organizations around the world faced potentially substantial costs after hackers threatened to keep computers disabled unless victims paid a ransom to receive a decryption key. "The impact on the U.S. seems to be negligible -- very tiny impact, very few victims," the senior intelligence official told ABC News on Saturday. By Friday evening, the ministry said it had “contained” the attack and denied that any of its information had been stolen. Huss is also worried about copycats, who could "take the exploit code that was used in this attack and implement it into their own virus." According to Europol, only few companies or individuals have so far opted to pay the ransom of $300 or more, following law enforcement recommendations.

<p>The unprecedented, global ransomware attack that started Friday has hit more than 200,000 companies, hospitals, government agencies and other organizations in 150 countries, the European Union's law enforcement agency said. Separately, Europol Jan Op Gen Oorth said Sunday that the number of individuals who have fallen victim to the cyberextortion attack could be much higher than is currently known as more people may find they were hit by the virus when they return to work Monday and switch on their computers.. He said it was too early to say who is behind the onslaught and what their motivation was. The attack is believed to be the biggest online extortion attack ever recorded, with victims including Britain’s hospital network and Germany’s national railway. The malicious cyberattack used leaked tools of the National Security Agency to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. Tens of thousands of users from London to St. Petersburg logged on Friday to find ominous threats to delete their suddenly encrypted computer files, unless they cough up $300 or more in Bitcoin payments to the unknown perpetrators, security experts and intelligence officials told ABC News on Saturday.. A message saying “Oops, your important files are encrypted” flashed across screens all over the world. According to The New York Times, experts estimated that before the last affected computers are unlocked, victims could collectively pay more than $1 billion to the attackers. The spread of the attack appears to have been thwarted by private cybersecurity researchers who identified and triggered the malware’s "kill switch," which halted the attacks before it spread throughout U.S. networks, a senior U.S. intelligence official confirmed, but it is unclear whether, the official said, a modified attack will soon be launched. "That is a huge concern right now," Darien Huss, a senior security research engineer at Proofpoint who was among the researchers who helped disable the virus, called "WannaCry," told ABC News Saturday. "It would not be very difficult at all to re-release this ransomware attack without a kill switch or without an approved kill switch that only they can activate." Huss is also worried about copycats, who could "take the exploit code that was used in this attack and implement it into their own virus." The tally of victims so far includes FedEx in the United States, railroads in Germany and Russia, factories and phone companies across Europe. Among the worst impacted by the historic attack unprecedented in its breadth was Britain's National Health Service, where more than 45 facilities had to suspend operations and divert patients and surgeries. "The impact on the U.S. seems to be negligible -- very tiny impact, very few victims," the senior intelligence official told ABC News on Saturday. "It's impacting overseas among those who have outdated software or pirated software," the senior intelligence official said. "The U.S. government is better suited to react and respond to something like this than some other countries because of years of work between the private sector and the government." Cybersecurity experts believe the attack was carried out with the help of tools first developed by the U.S. National Security Agency for targeting terrorists and foreign adversaries, which was leaked to the public by a hacker group called The Shadow Brokers in April. "They lost it, somebody stole the information published it on the internet, and now it's being used against victims in the United States and elsewhere," said John Bambenek of Fidelis Cybersecurity. While Microsoft broadened access to a security patch on Saturday to thousands of users whose old Windows support agreements have expired, law enforcement and intelligence authorities around the world, led by Britain’s new cybersecurity agency, are working to track down whoever was responsible -- with Russian organized crime considered a leading suspect, some experts said. "The reason this is hitting so many computers at once is that they discovered a vulnerability in the most popular operating system in the world, in Microsoft windows,” said John Carlin, former assistant attorney general for national security and an ABC News contributor. It’s one that Microsoft delivered a solution for, but a lot of people haven’t used it.” As the attack spread to five continents, the damage was contained, for the moment, when a computer programmer in Great Britain says he stumbled upon the kill switch after Huss shared some of his work on social media. The researcher, who uses the pseudonym "MalwareTech" for personal security, registered a domain name buried in the code of the attack and was surprised to discover that it was the kill switch that sent a signal to stop the attacks. "In this case, when we registered it, it turned out to be a kill switch," Salim Neino, CEO of Kryptos Logic, which employs MalwareTech as a cybersecurity researcher, told ABC News. The researcher behind "Malware Tech" sent the virus down a "sinkhole," preventing it from spreading more widely. "If Malware Tech had not sinkholed that domain as quickly as he had, we definitely could have seen many, many more infection that occurred," Huss said. We need to take the act of keeping our systems and devices up to date seriously," said Tyler Cohen Wood, a former senior intelligence official involved in cyber operations. "Unfortunately, until this is taken more seriously, this massive wide-scale type of attack is only the beginning." The number of affected networks and individuals is likely to go up, he said, because “many workers left their computer turned on last Friday and will probably find out that they are also affected by the malware on Monday morning.” Although the investigation is ongoing, Europol thinks the malware began to spread Friday from Britain’s National Health Service. According to Europol, only few companies or individuals have so far opted to pay the ransom of $300 or more, following law enforcement recommendations. Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s national railway service, tweeted that its train service had not been compromised and that it was working full speed to solve the problems. Other targets in Europe included Telefónica, the Spanish telecom giant; the French carmaker Renault; and a local authority in Sweden, which said about 70 computers were infected. That work is still ongoing,” Rudd told the BBC. </p>

<p> Already two of their members, Sens. You saw what the House Republicans did. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) In order for the proposal to actually move, Senate Republicans would need to include the same instructions in their own budget. Many of those warnings focused on the American Health Care Act’s proposed cuts to Medicaid. said this week. Authors: People had a chance to really see the impact ― line by line, amendment by amendment ― and know what they were actually passing.”

“You saw what the House Republicans did,” Murray added. You can unsubscribe at any time. When so many of the entitlement programs are taken off the table for discussion… that limits our ability to fund the non-defense discretionary programs and other mandatory programs that affect a lot of people.”

GOP backers of the idea will argue in the coming weeks and months that moderates have voted for GOP budgets that included similar cuts in the past — so they should be able to support them again. The net result is likely to be large losses of insurance coverage, even if they are not as large as the losses in the House bill. House leaders wrote legislation privately and then pushed it through the two committees of jurisdiction with markup sessions that lasted just one day each. But Portman told reporters on Wednesday that he was looking for a “soft landing” on Medicaid and that he supported ending expansion funding eventually. Medicare and Social Security, after all, comprise the lion’s share of government spending and more than 70 percent of all mandatory spending. And they will be fighting ultra-conservatives like Sens. Tax reform instructions will also be included in the budget, paving the way for both chambers to use the powerful budget reconciliation process to push a partisan tax bill through Congress on simple majority votes, as well as the $400 billion in mandatory cuts.</p>

<p>Senate Republicans have spent the last 10 days or so promising not to tackle health care in the same hurried, irresponsible way that their House counterparts did. “We are not under any deadlines,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said last week, “so we are going to take our time.” They have also suggested they have little interest in drafting something that looks like the American Health Care Act ― the wildly unpopular House bill that would roll back many of the Affordable Care Act’s most important insurance regulations and deprive something like 24 million people of coverage. “We’re starting over from a clean sheet of paper here,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) promised. All of that is probably true ― and less meaningful than it sounds at first blush. It’s possible to write a bill in a slower, more deliberative manner than the House did without allowing the kind lengthy, open public debate that legislation of such magnitude would seem to require. It’s also possible to pass less disruptive, less extreme legislation that would nevertheless take away insurance from many millions of people, causing widespread hardship. In fact, from the looks of things, this is precisely what Senate Republican leaders are trying to do. GOP leaders are trying to shield their legislation from scrutiny The big boast Senate Republicans are making is that they won’t vote on legislation before the Congressional Budget Office has a chance to analyze it. That’s what House Republicans did when they voted on their bill last week, less than 24 hours after making amendments that had potential to affect insurance coverage and the federal budget in fairly significant ways. “Y’all, I’m still waiting to see if it’s a boy or a girl,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) quipped afterward. “Any bill that has been posted less than 24 hours, going to be debated three or four hours, not scored? Needs to be viewed with suspicion.” But voting without a CBO score was merely one way in which the House rushed its debate. House leaders wrote legislation privately and then pushed it through the two committees of jurisdiction with markup sessions that lasted just one day each. Leaders had to pull the bill from the House floor at the last minute, because it lacked enough support to pass, but their response was to return to private negotiations, hash out the additional amendments, and then proceed quickly with the final vote. Even those House Republicans who had time to read and study the final language (many admitted they hadn’t) probably didn’t grasp its implications, because those implications were still becoming apparent in real time. Two days before the vote, for example, a Brookings Institution report showed how the bill could bring back annual and lifetime limits on benefits, even for employer policies. When you don’t read it, you don’t know what the impact is. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) Those limits, which the Affordable Care Act prohibits, would be a huge deal for that tiny portion of Americans dealing with the most severe medical problems ― think aggressive cancer that requires chemotherapy and surgery, or genetic disorders that require long stays in neonatal care. By the time a Wall Street Journal article on the subject brought the possibility to national attention, the vote was just hours away ― too late for new information to have an effect. Of course that was precisely what House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and his allies were trying to accomplish ― to avoid public scrutiny, to get legislation through the House before either the media or the public could recognize and seize on its shortcomings. “Probably straight to the floor,” Cornyn told CNN, when asked about the plan, “Because there has already been a lot of consultations on a bicameral basis to get us here.” Leadership hasn’t said much about his plans since that time, and the office of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declined to answer HuffPost’s inquiries about process and timetable. But on Wednesday, finance committee chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told The Hill, “I don’t think it’s going to go through the committees, at least from what I know about it.” Democrats are furious, in part because most of them were around in 2009 and 2010 when they spent more than a year writing and debating what eventually became the Affordable Care Act. For all of the discussion that took place behind closed doors back then, quite a lot took place in public ― over the course of more than 130 hearings, spanning five committees, according to a Democratic tally that didn’t even include administration events like the daylong, bipartisan session at Blair House that President Barack Obama presided over personally. People had a chance to really see the impact ― line by line, amendment by amendment ― and know what they were actually passing.” “You saw what the House Republicans did,” Murray added. And somebody who is being impacted doesn’t have a chance to say, ‘Wait a minute, that doesn’t work for me.’” This isn’t just some partisan talking point. Norm Ornstein, a respected political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, says, “The push and pull, give and take of an open markup can make a bad bill, with stupid provisions, sloppy drafting, unintended consequences, repeated mistakes from past experience, a better one.” Earlier this week, Murray and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), ranking Democrat on the finance committee, sent their GOP counterparts a letter demanding hearings. They have not gotten a formal response, and neither did HuffPost inquiries to those offices, except for a statement from Hatch’s office that he “appreciates Senate Democrats’ renewed interest in improving the nation’s healthcare system and welcomes their input and ideas as we move through this debate.” Most Republicans seem ready to accept some pretty big cuts One reason the House bill is so spectacularly unpopular is the likelihood that it will leave so many millions of Americans without health insurance. And from the very beginning of the debate, senators have been warning, publicly and privately, that they could not abide such dramatic losses of coverage. That includes phasing out the new funding available through Obamacare that the states have used to expand eligibility for the program ― effectively making it available to all people with incomes below or just above the poverty line. Among the 32 states that have accepted the money and expanded the program are more than a dozen with Republican senators. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who has reportedly taken the lead on figuring out how the Senate legislation will deal with Medicaid. But Portman told reporters on Wednesday that he was looking for a “soft landing” on Medicaid and that he supported ending expansion funding eventually. In the Senate, Republicans need 50 votes to pass legislation, assuming Vice President Mike Pence would break a tie, and they have only 52 seats. </p>
