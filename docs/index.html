<p>America's pension crisis is real — but not as bad as some companies want workers to believe. Employer contributions to defined benefit plans — the Cadillac of retirement packages once common among workers — are at the center of two labor strikes playing out in New York right now. The issue lurks in countless other contract negotiations across the state and country — with some employers looking to back-pedal their obligations while unions struggle to hold the line. Catastrophic stories about tanking pension funds — like the demise of the Teamsters Local 707 trust — lend urgency to employers who want to cut their financial liabilities, according to Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center. FDNY EMT injured on job says bureaucracy is dashing pension hopes Local 707 ran out of money after more than a decade of severe funding shortages, leaving its retirees trying to survive on a third of their promised pensions. However, not all such plans — sustained by multiple employers across an industry who pay into a shared pot — are doomed. Yet every time an employer backs out — or goes bankrupt — the strain grows on those who remain, Ferguson noted. “It is common to see companies all across the country trying to get out of multi-employer pension plans and bargain for 401(k) options for workers,” said Ferguson. “From a profitable employer's point of view, it’s a good deal for them. This is a hard place to be for a company and a hard place to be for a union.” On Long Island, a third-generation family-run beer distributorship is going toe-to-toe with its employees and their union, Teamsters Local 812, over the pension. Clare Rose wants to pull out of the Teamster’s fund, alleging that it’s “critical” status means the future retirement of employees is at risk. “We believe the pension plan is failing and it’s not good for our workers long-term,” Sean Rose, president of the company, told the Daily News in a recent interview. “The math doesn’t add up ... We don’t believe that it’s financially responsible to take care of our employees with a plan that doesn’t seem able to provide the benefits that it’s designed to provide. That’s the main reason we want to convert to a 401(k) plan,” said Rose. Local 3 member Jesus de La Cruz poses with actor Matt Damon, who came to show solidarity. (IBEW Local 3) Clare Rose pulling out of the pension fund — which costs them roughly $10,000 a year per employee — was the key issue that pushed its workers out on strike last month, the union said. The company proposed replacing it with a 401(k) with no more than a $1200 per employee annual contribution from the company — although that could still be negotiated higher, Rose said. The defined benefit plan of International Brotherhood of Electrician Workers Local 3 is also a major sticking point in its labor dispute with Charter Communications. Some 1,700 field and cable techs with Charter — parent company of Spectrum-Time Warner Cable — walked off the job nearly seven weeks ago over contribution disagreements for its health and pension funds. Charter said it had offered its techs a pay increase above what the union wanted and “competitive and robust health care and retirement benefits.” The company said it felt it was “more beneficial to our employees than continuing to fund the failing union-managed benefits program.” A spokesman reiterated the company’s position, but added it was willing to keep paying into the fund if necessary. Neither the Teamsters Local 812 fund or the IBEW Local 3 fund is technically failing — by the government definition of falling into a critical status that means its is severely underfunded. According to 2016 financial documents provided by IBEW, its plan is 81% funded and on track to improve. (Ginger Adams Otis/New York Daily News) “The plan was not in endangered, critical or critical and declining status” in 2016, the annual funding notice said. “Being critical, or red-zoned, means the fund is required to undertake a rehabilitation plan to keep it solvent going forward,” she said. You have to be in critical status to be able to take the necessary steps to save the plan,” she said. Tom Tolentino, owner of Planet Waste in Maspeth, told The News in March his contract with Local 813 could “bankrupt” his company because of its underfunded pension plan — and that motivated his workers to consider moving to a new union that only offers 401ks. </p>

<p> But for most of its history, it was exactly that. Again, I was drawn to the Temple of the Sun. And yet I still love the park. Temples like White Cloud and belief systems like Taoism are part of this search for answers. I see this in two places in this city where I now live. This was a time when Chinese parks rarely had grass. The state also built a new Taoist academy to train priests. And so the city changes — not back to the past but into something made up of ideas from the past — of filial piety, respect for authority, traditional religions, but also privilege for the rich. Like many people who have fallen in love with this city, I was disheartened and felt Beijing’s culture was lost. I ended up moving into one of the diplomatic compounds, and the neighborhood became my home.</p>

<p>May 13 (UPI) -- Commuters in New York City made a grim discovery Saturday morning, a dead man on a subway train – the fourth time in as many days police responded to a corpse found in public. Previously, police were called for reports of bodies floating in the Central Park Pond, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir in Central Park and a body hanging from a tree in Riverside Park. Police do not suspect foul play in any of the instances. The previous three are presumed suicides or accidents, investigators said. In Saturday's incident, police said passengers aboard the A train at Brooklyn's Jay Street-Metrotech station discovered the deceased man, identified as Robert Jones, 57. Police said the discovery of bodies floating in the city's rivers and other waterways is not unusual in spring, when currents change after the seasonal thaw. The fact two bodies were found in Central Park in two days is rare, however. "There's no signs of criminality as of now to make this anything other than coincidence," NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said of the first two bodies. "But it is unusual for the park." Adding the other two instances made it even stranger. When I first came to Beijing in 1984, the city felt dusty and forgotten, a onetime capital of temples and palaces that Mao had vowed — successfully, it seemed — to transform into a landscape of factories and chimneys. Soot penetrated every windowsill and every layer of clothing, while people rode simple steel bicycles or diesel-belching buses through the windy old streets. Then, as now, it was hard to imagine this sprawling city as the sacred center of China’s spiritual universe. But for most of its history, it was exactly that. It wasn’t a holy city like Jerusalem, Mecca or Banaras, locations whose very soil was hallowed, making them destinations for pilgrims. Yet Beijing’s streets, walls, temples, gardens and alleys were part of a carefully woven tapestry that reflected the constellations above, geomantic forces below and an invisible overlay of holy mountains and gods. It was a total work of art, epitomizing the political-religious system that ran traditional China for millenniums. Beijing’s cosmology changed in the 20th century, especially after the Communist takeover in 1949. Its great city walls and many of its temples and distinctive alleys, or hutong, were destroyed to make way for the new ideals of an atheistic, industrial society. The 1980s brought economic reforms and uncontrolled real estate development, which wiped out almost all of the rest of the old town. Lost was a vast medieval city of 25 square miles and also a way of life, just as the local cultures of the world’s other great cities have been swamped by our restless times. Over the years, I have watched some of this transformation, first as a student, then a journalist and now a writer and teacher. Like many people who have fallen in love with this city, I was disheartened and felt Beijing’s culture was lost. Beijing’s culture is not dead; it is being reborn in odd corners of the city and in unexpected ways. It is not the same as in the past, but still vibrant and real — ways of life and belief that echo bygone days. These are places that seemed forgotten and irrelevant, but they have slowly taken on a new importance in recent years as Chinese search for new values and beliefs to underpin their post-Communist society. The Temple of Heaven is easily the most famous, but the Temple of the Sun reveals more because it is less of a showpiece. This was a period of radical Communist violence from 1966 to 1976, when every place of worship and many symbols of the past were attacked. The main stone altar, a flat disk about 20 feet across and raised about 2 feet off the ground, was smashed by Mao’s zealots. I studied Chinese language and literature at Peking University from 1984 to 1985 and biked over to this area because it had become the country’s chief diplomatic district and one of the few places where homesick Westerners could buy chocolate and postcards. In the post-Mao era, China was opening up, and so it built embassies and modern apartment blocks to house foreign diplomats and journalists. I remember walking through the park, its altar recently reconstructed, but many of the buildings so dilapidated that the grounds seemed abandoned. A few Beijing residents ventured in occasionally to fly kites, and diplomats’ children would run around the altar’s low peripheral wall testing its acoustics. Back then the park had an entrance fee that kept it relatively empty, especially in what was now a crowded, bustling city. It cost only 50 cents to enter, but China was still relatively poor and people weren’t inclined to spend their time on exercise. It was possible to walk the roughly 1-mile perimeter path and encounter only a few people, often diplomats from the nearby embassies or spooks keeping an eye on things. </p>

<p>Katz's Delicatessen has been urging customers to "send a salami to your boy in the Army" for generations. Now, the New York City restaurant, where everyone's favorite scene from "When Harry Met Sally" was shot, is expanding its shipping capacity so it can send perishable delicacies like pastrami and corned beef around the globe.The plan to offer a taste of authentic, old New York by mail is part of an ongoing effort by Katz's young owner to modernize a business that hasn't changed much since it was founded on Manhattan's Lower East Side in 1888. "I can't necessarily replicate the entire experience for you, wherever you are at home," said Jake Dell, 29. I can bring it a little bit closer to you.

Read more... ↑This tiny, rustic one-bedroom apartment is part of the massive Cobble Hill Towers complex, built in 1879 by philanthropist Alfred Tredway White, and located next to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Measuring just under 500 square feet, this condo comes fitted with oak wood gray stained flooring, exposed brick walls, and recessed lighting throughout. Local councils and state governments pull most of the levers on housing, and the interest rate component is decided by an independent agency, the Reserve Bank. It chose super: the idea to allow first home buyers to save a deposit by salary sacrificing extra pre-tax contributions, up to $30,000, is a good one. Most investment options in superannuation have some link to the share markets or property markets. While there is a formula to determine how much you can withdraw for a home deposit, returns on the remaining funds within super may vary. I would have liked the government to have a go at housing affordability by using the tax system - probably its biggest lever to increase supply. The jury's out on that one, but if you do see your mortgage costs creeping up, you should start looking around at alternatives. Wage growth is a good sign in general terms but it suggests an environment in which interest rates will rise from their historically low point of 1.5 per cent. This will hit home loan borrowers, so make sure you build in a buffer if you're getting a loan. Think about rent-vesting, where you buy an investment property in an area you can afford, then rent where you want to live. Think also about co-ownership - or "clubbing" - where you buy a place with another person. </p>

The move toward broadening alternatives to struggling district schools has largely been underwritten by some of the country's wealthiest people, including Betsy DeVos, whom President Donald Trump elevated to U.S. education secretary. While donors include those who support charter schools, which are public schools but privately run, DeVos and others want to take choice further with programs like vouchers that allow tax money to pay for private school tuition and government-funded scholarships. Bloomberg declined to comment on his support of the Massachusetts ballot initiative, or whether he favors vouchers or other choice programs beyond charter schools. In all, the former mayor's political contributions to school choice initiatives from 2007-2016 represent a fraction of his more than $76 million in contributions to various candidates and causes, the analysis found.

<p>The high-risk sex offender arrested for a violent robbery and sexual attack on a tourist in Harlem is being eyed in another sex assault, prosecutors said at his arraignment Friday. Keon Robinson, 28, was ordered held without bail on two pending cases when he was brought before a judge in Manhattan Criminal Court. Assistant District Attorney Erin Reid described in graphic detail how Robinson allegedly left the British woman — who hails from Germany — bleeding and unconscious on the sidewalk on W. 146th St. between Frederick Douglass and Adam Clayton Powell Blvds. The 31-year-old victim was naked from the waist down and Robinson had molested her after beating her unconscious, prosecutors said.

Robinson had already been deemed a Level 3 sex offender — the highest risk category — for biting and trying to rape a woman in Brooklyn at gunpoint in 2006. Robinson's court-appointed lawyer on Friday afternoon made an unsuccessful bid to get bail set for him and argued that "you couldn't make out" from the video of the May 4 attack who was responsible. "I don't think the video I have is sufficient to show that my client is the person who committed this offense," said the attorney Mitch Schuman.

Surveillance video released by cops shows the man holding the woman against a wall and grabbing her bag, which contained her passport and laptop. When she tries to pull her bag back, he whacks her in the face so hard that she’s knocked to the ground — where he then hits her face at least three more times, the video shows. Police sources said that the man initially ran away because the victim was yelling, but he came back when she passed out and sexually assaulted her. The victim sustained trauma to her face and paramedics rushed her to Harlem Hospital where she was listed in stable condition, police said. “There’s some really bad people out here,” a longtime resident who would only identify herself as Tamara said. </p>

<p>Advertisement 10 Things to Do in NYC Now It’s a big city, with plenty to do, see, hear and watch. Here’s a sampling of cultural highlights this weekend and over the week ahead. Image Visitors to the weekly “DrawNow!” program at the Central Park Zoo will have the opportunity to sketch sea lions, recreating the experiences of early naturalists. Credit Julie Larsen Maher/Wildlife Conservation Society For Children Sitting (and Diving and Barking) for Their Portraits, All in the Name of Science ‘DrawNow!’ at the Central Park Zoo Most children probably think of a scientist’s tools as instruments like microscopes and telescopes. It wasn’t so long ago, however, that pencils, brushes, paint and paper were just as important. The Drawing Center is revisiting that era every Saturday in May at the zoo, where it’s recreated the Department of Tropical Research, a field station for the trailblazing naturalist William Beebe (1877-1962), who visited South America and the Caribbean, taking along artists who produced colorful records. Open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and presented in conjunction with the Drawing Center’s exhibition “Exploratory Works: Drawings From the Department of Tropical Research Field Expeditions,” the zoo’s station welcomes young visitors to the adventure with art materials, activity cards and marine specimens. Every hour, from 11 a.m. through 2 p.m., Beebe and one of his artists, Else Bostelmann, will join them in the form of actors from the Wildlife Theater Troupe, who will conduct a 30-minute science and drawing program. It culminates with sketching some wonderful live models: the zoo’s sea lions. LAUREL GRAEBER Find more events for children and families.

Credit Lawrence Sumulong Jazz Anticipated Debut From a Prizewinning Voice Jazzmeia Horn at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola On Friday the young vocalist Ms. Horn releases her debut album, “A Social Call.” The record declares her allegiance to the jazz tradition, while claiming space for a contemporary perspective. Its 10 tracks include the standards “Tight” and “East of the Sun (And West of the Moon)”; the Stylistics’ “People Make the World Go Round”; and the gospel number “Up Above My Head.” Ms. Horn, who won the 2015 Thelonious Monk Institute International Jazz Competition, has an arrestingly precise attack — dilated in the low end and neatly pinched up top. She’s joined at these two Monday night shows by the tenor saxophonist Stacy Dillard, the trumpeter Josh Evans, the trombonist Frank Lacy, the pianist Victor Gould, the bassist Barry Stephenson and the drummer Henry Conerway III.

Rotating among plant forms, glimpses of outer space and schematic self-portraits, they are indebted to Marsden Hartley’s robust brushwork and rich palette, Forrest Bess’s visionary quirkiness and Arthur Dove’s collage-assemblages. Built as much as painted, they are supplemented with marbles; dried weeds; ribbon; small stones; and scraps of wood, shingle and jewelry — all of which enhance the votive quality. There’s also rope, sometimes burned and sometimes used for framing, echoing Picasso’s famous 1912 “Still Life With Chair Caning.” Occasionally the edges break out in jagged zigzags. In the radiant “Jumbo,” they might be sunbeams, or signs of the discovery of the Higgs boson.

Best known for her many years as a dancer in the work of Miguel Gutierrez, Ms. Boulé has been charting her own choreographic path in recent years. To a score of disco music and ambient sound, designed by Curtis Tamm, she continues harnessing what she calls “the power and mystery of the feminine” in performances Wednesday through May 27. With a cocktail hour and live auction, the show, starting at 6 p.m. on Monday, will feature a mixture of veteran comedians (Joy Behar, a host of “The View,” and Robert Klein, who has been performing since he joined the Second City comedy troupe in 1965); established working comics (Judy Gold and Des Bishop); and up-and-comers (Bob the Drag Queen and Tim Dillon). Miyavi, an Osaka-born guitarist whose music is powered by jubilant string-slapping, will headline, along with the constantly innovating rock band Blonde Redhead and the Afrobeat mavens of Antibalas.

<p>Mexican New Yorkers are getting free immigration help with a pop-up office run by the Mexican government. Visitors can sign up to get a certified copy of their birth certificate, which is required for most forms of identification and travel documents, including ID NYC cards and passports. Those we spoke with say it hasn't been easy generally to get certain documents. "I have many, many problems to make the papers, with the passport," said one immigrant. "I wanna do a passport for my kids in case something happens, every papers," said another. "I need to get ready." "A lot of the immigrants in New York and around the United States are fearful of arrest and documentation for the pettiest things," said Community Activist Eddie Borges. "If they have their birth certificate, they can start building that foundation of paperwork from the library card to the driver's license to be safe and secure in their home." The pop-up office is the first of its kind in the U.S., and officials say they will destroy paperwork afterwards to protect the identities of all applicants. BOOKS DRAWN ON FOR THIS ARTICLE Forgotten Citizens: Deportation, Children, and the Making of American Exiles and Orphans by Luis H. Zayas Oxford University Press, 272 pp., $24.95 Lives in Limbo: Undocumented and Coming of Age in America by Roberto G. Gonzales, with a foreword by Jose Antonio Vargas University of California Press, 287 pp., $85.00; $29.95 (paper) During a visit to Detroit in March, John Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, took some time to explain President Trump’s deportation plans to wary community leaders and immigrant advocates. “We’ve got to do something,” Kelly said, with a note of frustration. “We’re almost at a crisis right now because you have 11 million people in America that are below the radar. Most of them are not bad people to say the least. We’re after the ones, the worst of the worst, if you will. But I can’t ignore the law.” Kelly was giving a tempered version of statements Trump had made in the first weeks of his administration, which were significantly revised from his campaign promise that, starting on “day one,” he would deport millions of immigrants who were in the country illegally. Once he was in the White House, Trump narrowed his aim, at least in his rhetoric, to “criminal aliens.” In his speech to Congress on February 28, the president said, “As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak.” But what has this meant in practice? Since the first days of the Trump administration, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE , has been conducting what it calls targeted enforcement operations around the country. The agency said that those detained included many immigrants convicted of serious crimes, such as aggravated assault, spousal battery, and sex offenses with minors. However, many of the people who have been rounded up do not appear to fit into the categories of malicious lawbreakers described by Trump and his homeland security secretary. For example, according to the Austin American-Statesman, out of fifty-one people arrested in that Texas city during the enforcement operations in February, twenty-eight had no criminal records but had “built quiet lives and stayed out of trouble.” ICE has not publicized the cases of immigrants—probably many thousands—who have been summoned to report to its offices because of past immigration violations and are now in the process of deportation. While these operations drew attention in the press, in some ways ICE was not acting very differently than it had under President Obama, who oversaw more than three million deportations during his eight years in office. In his first term, Obama, seeking to establish his credibility as a tough enforcer, implemented a nationwide fingerprint system to check the immigration status of anyone booked by police. Obama had hoped that his enforcement record would help convince Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform that would include a pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants. But in his second term, once it was clear that Obama would not be able to get support from Republicans for any broad legalization measure, he worked to restrain the deportations machine his administration had created. He directed ICE agents to focus closely on convicted criminals and recent illegal border crossers, and discouraged them from tearing apart families solely because of immigration offenses, which generally are civil, not criminal, violations. The number of deportations from inside the country (not at the border) declined significantly in his final years in office. Now Trump, with his executive orders and his ominous warnings about the dangers “illegals” pose for Americans, is eliminating Obama’s restraints and spurring agents to use the tools they have to deport as many people as possible. By the time he received a summons to appear on February 8 at the Newark offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he had been living in the United States for twenty-five years. His problem is that his work permits were issued based on an application for political asylum that a notario, an accountant not qualified to practice law, had filed, he says, without telling him—a common immigration scam in the 1990s. It took until 2010 for the asylum claim, for which he was never eligible, to fail definitively in immigration court. One day not long thereafter he received a notice that a judge had ordered him to be deported. Stricken with worry, he had a stroke, its effects soon compounded by acute episodes of diabetes. Three times during the Obama administration, agents from ICE came for Guerrero and told him to get ready to leave for Mexico. As happened with increasing frequency during Obama’s last years, officials considered his clean record, his consistent employment, his tax payments, his community ties, and his medical condition, and they decided to suspend the deportation, placing him under an order of supervision that required him to stay out of trouble and check in with ICE once a year. But after Trump made it a point in his campaign to vilify Mexicans as rapists and traffickers, Guerrero knew the February meeting with ICE would be different. He was granted no relief and told to report again in May. </p>

South Beach:

Yes, there are tourist traps aplenty in the neighborhood that started it all. And if you're in Manhattan, it's likely you'll visit the Flatiron Building. You can find a comprehensive guide here.</p>
<h2>LSTM-based Method</h2>
<p>It's hard to feel like a "local" in New York City. We're a city of immigrants, of neighborhoods in constant transition. Even our most famous foods — pizza and bagels — are regularly reinvented. Yet it's food that ties so many New Yorkers to their neighborhoods — that makes a place constantly in flux feel like it has some stability. It's what gives your neighborhood character and makes you feel like a "local." Having heard of or eaten at a spot is the social indicator that you're part of the community. At the same time, New Yorkers revel in knowing about a particular spot before anyone else — especially tourists. I fall into this category, which is why I was so delighted to find the secret best breakfast sandwich in Manhattan. Not only is it tremendously delicious, there's almost never a line. And here's the kicker: It's located smack in the middle of one of Manhattan's most touristy areas. View As: One Page Slides If you're visiting New York City, it's likely you'll spend the majority of your time in Manhattan. And if you're in Manhattan, it's likely you'll visit the Flatiron Building. Between Madison Square Park and the Flatiron Building, the Flatiron District is a major tourist destination in Manhattan. It's at the intersection of Broadway, 23rd Street, and Fifth Avenue — you can look in any direction and stare down a tremendous stretch of Manhattan. I admit I'm biased toward it, however, as Business Insider's headquarters is a few blocks south of the Flatiron Building. But with all the neighborhood's good comes the bad. Because of the high volume of tourists, there's a ton of rip-off tourist food that tastes bad and costs a lot of money. And if you're a tourist, how are you to tell the bad from the good? Unbelievably, there's a bastion of great food in the middle of all this — and that bastion is a tourist destination unto itself. Eataly is the brainchild of the Italian entrepreneur Oscar Farinetti; the one in the Flatiron is notorious for its association with Mario Batali, the famed chef and restaurateur. It's essentially a massive Italian supermarket/food hall, with a full grocery selection alongside various food stands and full restaurants. You can buy some tomatoes and eat some handmade pasta with a glass of Italian wine. Between its location and the kind of store it is — an upscale food hall featuring imported Italian foods — you're right to guess it's also an expensive place. But I've discovered an amazing exception to this logic. The difference in quality, however, is ridiculous. The standard kaiser-roll breakfast sandwich in New York City is a classic, and I don't want to infer that these fancy sandwiches are in any way a replacement. But if you're in the Flatiron District, you're just as likely to spend $7 at a corner deli for a breakfast sandwich. It's also likely you'd run into a huge line as people scramble to get breakfast on their way to work. Every sandwich, like this New York PLT, is served on a freshly baked ciabatta roll — a major step up from the traditional kaiser roll at delis. That said, I'm nitpicking here — I'd happily eat the PLT again, for breakfast or lunch (or anytime you want to give me one). And at $5.80, it's a steal compared with even the average NYC corner deli, especially those in the more touristy parts of Manhattan. It's not too far in the store, and it'll likely be the only staffed area you'll see without a big line. It's possible the breakfast counter gets outrageously busy at 10:15 a.m., but based on my experience — and that of my colleagues, who are now on their own breakfast quests — that doesn't seem to be the case. </p>

The ten-story, 110,000-square-foot structure will provide much-needed smart classrooms, textile labs, administrative offices, and the first dedicated student life hall on the campus in nearly two decades. The design embodies a transparency that reflects the college's vision of openness, exploration, and the robust exchange of ideas across many platforms. The street reconstruction plan on the Rockaway peninsula signifies a focus on environmental sustainability and resiliency in the wake of extreme weather events. The overarching goals of the design are to reinforce Mott Avenue as a 'village main street' with a connection to existing neighborhood assets and recent public improvement projects, such as the reconstruction of the Far Rockaway Queens Branch Library. Image Courtesy of NYC Office of the Mayor Serving as the central inspection location for over 13,500 taxis, the renovated and expanded Woodside facility will provide a welcoming and dignified experience for drivers and other members of New York City's transportation industry. The reconfiguration of the ground level creates additional traffic lanes, reduces congestion, and expedites operations on site while improving traffic flow on the adjacent roadway. Image Courtesy of NYC Office of the Mayor New York City's Department of Environmental Protection is tasked with delivering more than one billion gallons of pristine drinking water to nine million New Yorkers every day. New York City is one of only five municipalities in the country allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency to maintain an unfiltered water supply - a testament to the strength and effectiveness of DEP's efforts around watershed protection. DEP's use of green infrastructure to manage stormwater runoff in its upstate properties is a critical component of maintaining the high quality of New York City's drinking water supply. Each project is thoughtfully designed for the specific site context and will ultimately function as part of a larger resilient plan to reduce sediment and pollutants from entering our water supply. </p>

<p>The season has not started, but the conversations already have begun. “It’s definitely talked about, knowing that we can win a championship, knowing that this can be ours if we do all the little things right,” star center Tina Charles said before Saturday’s season-opener against San Antonio at Madison Square Garden. (3 p.m., MSG) “That’s something we do think about.” It is often thought about because they have fallen short of that goal in the first 20 years of the WNBA’s existence, making the Liberty the league’s only original team without a championship. It is thought about more because the team’s 44-24 record over the past two seasons is better than any two-year stretch in franchise history, and the Liberty reached the Eastern Conference finals in 2015. Charles, a former league MVP, and last year’s runner-up, just became the third-ever player to lead the league in scoring (21.5 points) and rebounds (9.9) in the same season. It is a thought that fifth-year coach Bill Laimbeer wants to stick with the players all season, especially the supporting cast — Kiah Stokes, Brittany Boyd and Rebecca Allen, among others — who likely will decide if the Liberty can reach the WNBA Finals for the first time in 15 years. “We have some players that are coming into the time when they have to step forward, the younger ones especially,” said Laimbeer, who previously won three titles with the Detroit Shock. “It’s time for them to step up if we’re going to be a contender. “I think there’s a sense of urgency, especially on Tina Charles’ part. She wants to take the next step for the championship.” Charles, a Queens native, and Brooklyn’s Epiphanny Prince, and Tanisha Wright, will be joined this season by newly acquired guard Bria Hartley of Long Island, and the returning Kia Vaughn of The Bronx. Vaughn’s first stint with Liberty lasted from 2009-2012. Together, the New York natives possess enough talent to accomplish what the franchise’s former stars never could. “We take it more personally to want to bring a championship home, the fact that we do have so many New York City players here,” Charles said. “We know what it’s worth to have a championship here, to give the organization its first. We grew up watching the likes of Teresa Weatherspoon and Becky Hammon, and now we just want to make it happen.” A few Liberty players to watch: Tina Charles of Queens, a Connecticut graduate: “The best player on the Liberty, who led the W.N.B.A. in both scoring and rebounding last year,” Mr. Megdal said.

As much as we were laughing it was like, 'No, but seriously, what are we going to do about this?'"

"And most of the people responding were like, 'We're really glad you took those down.' Caldwell and Rushmore (an artist and social media manager respectively) did their first phone booth takeover in January, starting in Brooklyn with a 26 x 50 inch print of "Shipwrecks of Unicorn Beach" by chandelier maker and photographer Adam Wallacavage. "The infrastructure is there, but it doesn't serve any purpose," he said. Caldwell and Rushmore have scheduled artists to feature through the end of the yearabout half of the total have "strong ties" to NYCplanning ahead in part because it's cheaper to print in batches of ten to twenty (the project is self-funded; artists just give their consent). </p>

Speaking after an emergency Cobra meeting, Ms Rudd said "there's always more" that could be done to protect against computer viruses. She said 97% of NHS trusts were "working as normal" and there was no evidence patient data was affected. Europol described it as "unprecedented" and said its cyber-crime team was working with affected countries to "mitigate the threat and assist victims". Ms Rudd insisted the government had "the right plans" to limit the impact of the attack, which also affected the Nissan car plant in Sunderland. 'Britain left defenceless' The Liberal Democrats and Labour have both demanded an inquiry into the cyber-attack. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth also called for a "full, independent inquiry" into the cyber-attack. As of 21:00 BST on Saturday, the following NHS England trusts were still reporting IT difficulties on their websites: St Bartholomew's in London East and North Hertfordshire Trust James Paget University Hospitals Trust, Norfolk Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust York Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust The 48 NHS trusts affected did not include GP practices. The Scottish government said most NHS computers were expected to be operational by Monday. NHS England said patients needing emergency treatment on Saturday evening should go to A&E or access emergency services as they normally would. However, a small number of non-urgent services may take some time to return to normal. For example, United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust has already cancelled routine appointments, tests and operations on Monday. The malware spread quickly on Friday leaving hospitals and GPs unable to access patient data, with many doctors resorting to using pen and paper. Their computers were locked by a ransomware program which demanded a payment to access blocked files.

Kingsley Manning, a former chairman of NHS Digital, said the government and the NHS had been "very well aware" that a cyber-attack was a threat and "significant amounts of money" had been invested "in anticipation that this sort of thing would happen". Mr Manning told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: "Some trusts took the advice that was offered to them very seriously and acted on it and some of them may not have done.

"Our military is closely monitoring for provocative movements by North Korea and is maintaining all readiness postures," a statement from the military said. The missile, launched near the city of Kusong, flew 700 kilometers (435 miles), the South Korean military said. A US defense official confirmed that it flew that far, but said the US is still assessing what type of missile it was. This is the first provocative move from North Korea since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office. Moon has advocated dialogue with North Korea to denuclearize. The firing of the missile could also be seen as an insult to Beijing. China remains one of North Korea's only allies and is responsible for much of the heavily-sanctioned nation's economy. North Korea launched a missile from a test facility near the country's west coast early Sunday morning, U.S. officials tell CBS News national security correspondent David Martin. The missile flew for 30 minutes before landing the Sea of Japan, Reuters said, citing a Japanese official.

May 9, 2017 White House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks to reporters outside the West Wing after President Trump dismissed James B. Comey from his position as FBI director.

Democrats slowed committee business in the Senate to protest the lack of an independent investigation into Russia’s election meddling, and Republicans saw rifts emerge as more questioned the president’s decision. In deciding to abruptly fire FBI Director James B. Comey, President Trump characteristically let himself be guided by his own instincts — fueled by his creeping anger and sense of victimhood about a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election that he considers a “witch hunt.” The aftermath is a presidency rocked by its most serious self-inflicted crisis yet, exposing dysfunction and distrust within his West Wing and imperiling his agenda. The momentum for the health-care bill that passed the House is gone, and a week scheduled to be devoted to Trump’s preparations for a high-stakes foreign trip was overtaken by distractions and fury. Across Washington, Trump’s allies have been buzzing about the staff’s competence as well as the president’s state of mind. One GOP figure close to the White House mused privately about whether Trump was “in the grip of some kind of paranoid delusion.” Trump has been stewing all week, aggrieved by sharp media scrutiny of his decision to fire Comey and of his and his aides’ ever-shifting explanations, and has been quick to blame his staff, according to several people who have spoken with him. Privately, Trump has lashed out at the communications office — led by press secretary Sean Spicer and communications director Michael Dubke — and has spoken candidly with advisers about a broad shake-up that could include demotions or dismissals. The president personally has conducted postmortem interviews with aides about the Comey saga, investigating the unending stream of headlines he considers unfairly negative, according to several White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Trump is cracking down on unauthorized leaks. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) “This was the first major crisis or test they’ve had, and it looks like a lot of systems failed,” said Chris Ruddy, a Trump confidant and chief executive of Newsmax. “My experience with the president is when he sees failure, he quickly adapts and tries new things. He’s not a guy that keeps the same ol’.” The system may be failing, but it is Trump picking which buttons to press. And chaos has been a hallmark of Trump’s enterprises, from his family real estate empire to his presidential campaign, a 16-month venture during which he cycled through three leadership teams. [Inside Trump’s anger and impatience — and his sudden decision to fire Comey] Inside the White House, there was widespread agreement that Comey had to go. But how and when Trump would fire him — and how it would be rationalized to the public — was the subject of considerable debate. Would Trump first visit with Comey in person and ask for his resignation or fire him abruptly? (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Would Trump slow down the process so that a communications strategy could be crafted, with credible surrogates lined up to defend his decision, or terminate Comey about 24 hours after first telling top aides he wanted it done? And would he be restrained on Twitter, as his advisers have urged, or peck out a provocative salvo at Comey warning of possible “tapes” of their private conversations? White House aides have felt bewildered and alarmed by how Trump arrives at his decisions — often on impulse and emotion and sometimes by rejecting the counsel of those around him — and how he then communicates those decisions to his personnel and the public. “The Comey firing is just the most dramatic example of a White House that is completely dysfunctional, the most chaotic in modern history,” said Chris Whipple, author “The Gatekeepers,” a newly published history of White House chiefs of staff. That simply has not happened.” [The Take: Comey firing shows White House problems go far beyond communications strategy] Robert M. Gates, a former defense secretary who informally advised Trump during the transition, criticized his handling of Comey’s ouster. “Not terribly well done,” Gates told John Dickerson in a CBS News interview scheduled to air Sunday on “Face the Nation.” “I fired a lot of senior people myself, and I think the key, when you feel compelled to remove a senior official, is essentially to have all your ducks in a row at the beginning,” he continued. And, if possible, to announce who you’re going to nominate to replace that person.” As Trump’s anger with the Comey fallout boiled over, his aides have been pointing fingers at one other. Much of the internal blame has fallen to the communications operation, with Kushner and other top officials questioning why the small army of press staffers led by Spicer and Dubke took so long to forcefully defend the president’s decision and agree to a set of talking points that could withstand scrutiny, according to several White House officials. Inside the West Wing, it became a running joke among some staffers that the answer to every question would be “Rosenstein,” referring to the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, who wrote a memo outlining a case for Comey’s ouster. “They were running around like chickens with their heads cut off,” said one White House official. “There was no leadership, no ‘get your troops in a room and issue orders and execute.’ ” [After Trump fired Comey, White House staff scrambled to explain why] Yet Trump did not inform Spicer and Dubke of his decision until about an hour before it was announced, keeping them and other senior aides out of the loop because he feared the news might leak prematurely, officials said. But a third person denied that Bannon first learned Comey had been fired from television news reports and said that he had actually counseled Trump to delay his decision to lessen the political backlash. The explanation delivered Tuesday night by Spicer, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway and deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders — that Trump acted decisively at the recommendation of Rosenstein and Sessions — was discussed with and agreed to by the president himself, officials said. “We were absolutely given the information that we could have at that time,” Sanders told reporters Thursday. We took the information we had, as best we had it, and got it out to the American people as quickly as we could.” Trump defended his spokesmen, tweeting Friday that they should not be expected to speak with “perfect accuracy” and later complaining to Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro about the “level of hostility” against them. Some of Trump’s allies said they are worried that the president views the Comey episode entirely as a public-affairs crisis — a branding problem — and has not been judicious about protecting himself from legal exposure as the FBI continues to investigate possible links between his campaign and Russia. [Trump said he was thinking of Russia controversy when he decided to fire Comey] When Trump sat down for the interview with NBC anchor Lester Holt, his aides were not certain what he might say. </p>

<p>Pope Francis added two Portuguese shepherd children to the roster of Catholic saints Saturday, honoring young siblings whose reported visions of the Virgin Mary 100 years ago turned the Portuguese farm town of Fatima into one of the world's most important Catholic shrines. Francis proclaimed Francisco and Jacinta Marto saints at the start of Mass marking the centenary of their visions. A half-million people watched in the vast square in front of the shrine's basilica, the Vatican said, citing Portuguese authorities. Many had spent days at Fatima in quiet prayer, reciting rosaries before a statue of the Madonna. "It is amazing, it is like an answer to prayer because I felt that always they would be canonized," said Agnes Walsh from Killarney, Ireland. She said she prayed to Francisco Marto for 20 years, hoping her four daughters would meet "nice boys like Francisco." ''The four of them have met boys that are just beautiful I couldn't ask for better, so he has answered all my prayers," she said. Francisco and Jacinta, aged 9 and 7, and their 10-year-old cousin, Lucia, reported that on March 13, 1917, the Virgin Mary made the first of a half-dozen appearances to them here while they grazed their sheep. They said she confided in them three secrets — foretelling apocalyptic visions of hell, war, communism and the death of a pope — and urged them to pray for peace and a conversion away from sin. At the time, Europe was in the throes of World War I, and the Portuguese church was suffering under anti-clerical laws from the republican government that had forced many bishops and priests into exile. "Our Lady foretold, and warned us about, a way of life that is godless and indeed profanes God in his creatures," Francis said in his homily. "We can take as our examples Saint Francisco and Saint Jacinta, whom the Virgin Mary introduced into the immense ocean of God's light and taught to adore him," he said. Many toss wax body parts — hands, hearts, livers and limbs — into a giant fire pit at the shrine as an offering. The boy, aged 5 at the time, had fallen 6.5 meters (21 feet) from a window in 2013 and suffered such severe head trauma that his doctors said he would be severely mentally disabled or in a vegetative state if he even survived. The boy not only survived but has no signs of any after-effects. "We thank God for Lucas' cure and we know in all faith from our heart that this miracle was obtained with the help of the little shepherd children Francisco and Jacinta," Baptista told reporters earlier as the family broke their silence to reveal details of the case. The text, written by Lucia, had been kept in a sealed envelope inside the Vatican for decades, with no pope daring to reveal it because of its terrifying contents: a "bishop dressed in white" — the pope — on his knees at the foot of a cross, killed in a hail of bullets and arrows, along with other bishops, priests and various lay Catholics.

The two girls and a boy said she told them three secrets, which were later interpreted as foretelling the Second World War, the rise and fall of Communism and the death of a pope. At first doubted by the local Catholic Church and even their parents, the children's story gained believers and was eventually accepted as an authentic apparition by the church in 1930.

Pakistan has been a flagship country and one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the One Belt-One Road initiative, in part because many projects are for power plants to alleviate the country's decade-long energy-shortage crisis that sees frequent blackouts. "China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a core component of your visionary initiative of the "One Belt-One Road," Sharif told Xi when they met at the Great Hall of China on Saturday, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan. Among the 3.4 billion RMB($493 million) in deals Sharif's office said were signed on Saturday were: * Two cooperation agreements worth 2.3 billion RMB ($333 million) for an airport in the southwestern town of Gwadar, site of a deep-water port that is to provide an outlet to the Arabian Sea from the far western Chinese province of Xinjiang. Pakistan, however, has expressed an optimistic view, with the government's chief economist telling Reuters this week that the repayments will peak at around $5 billion in 2022, but will be more than offset by transit fees charged on the new transport corridor. </p>

<p> ''I had it in Moscow long time ago, but other than that I have nothing to do with Russia," he said, referring to the pageant. The letter doesn't vouch for any of Trump's personal federal tax returns that predate the past decade. The president said he "had dealings over the years," including the Miss Universe pageant and the sale of a home to "a very wealthy Russian." Trump had purchased the 62,000 square-foot estate for $41.35 million in 2004 and he sold the mansion to Rybolovlev in July 2008 for $95 million.

The president cited the letter in an interview with Lester Holt of NBC News as proof that there were no hidden financial ties between him and Russia.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Lawyers for President Donald Trump said Friday that a review of his last 10 years of tax returns did not reflect "any income of any type from Russian sources," but their letter included exceptions related to previously cited income generated from a beauty pageant and sale of a Florida estate. The letter represented the latest attempt by the president to tamp down concerns about any Russian ties amid an ongoing investigation of his campaign's associates and Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. The attorneys did not release copies of Trump's tax returns, so The Associated Press cannot independently verify their conclusions. Their review also notably takes into account only Trump's returns from the past 10 years, leaving open questions about whether there were financial dealings with Russia in earlier years. The lawyers offered no supporting documents to back up the claims made in the letter. Trump has refused to release his income tax records, despite pressure from Democrats, breaking with a practice set by his predecessors. The president has said he would release his returns when the Internal Revenue Service completes an audit. The tax returns, the attorneys say, largely reflect income and interest paid by the web of corporate entities that made up The Trump Organization prior to Trump taking office. Joseph Thorndike, a tax historian and contributing editor to an accounting trade publication, Tax Analysts, said he still believes Trump should release his tax returns like other presidents have and questioned the value of the letter released Friday. "I'm not sure it does what the president thought it would do," Thorndike said of the letter. "It rules out some of the most obvious things, but it leaves plenty of room." Thorndike said in general there's no reason to assume that Russia connections, if they existed, would appear on Trump's personal tax returns. "It's not going to be as transparent as that. In the letter released to the AP and dated March 8, the attorneys said Trump's last 10 years of tax returns don't reflect equity investments by Russians in entities controlled by Trump or debt owed by Trump to Russian lenders. The letter said the returns do reflect some income from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant that was held in Moscow and a property sold to a Russian billionaire in 2008 for $95 million. Graham leads one of the congressional committees investigating Russia's interference in last year's election. The letter came amid an active FBI probe into the Trump 2016 campaign's possible ties to Russia's election meddling and days after Trump's stunning firing of FBI Director James Comey. "I have no investments in Russia, none whatsoever," Trump said Thursday in an interview with NBC News. ''I had it in Moscow long time ago, but other than that I have nothing to do with Russia," he said, referring to the pageant. The unnamed Russian billionaire cited by the Trump company's lawyers is Dmitry Rybolovlev, whose financial empire springs from his companies' production of potash, often used for fertilizer. When Trump was pressed during a campaign conference last year about his ties to Russia, he said: "You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach," adding that "I sold it to a Russian for $100 million." The attorneys also write that over the last 10 years, it is likely that the Trump Organization sold or rented condos, or other products, that "could have produced income attributable to Russian sources." WASHINGTON — President Trump’s lawyers say his income tax returns do not show income from Russian sources or debt owed to Russians, with the exception of $95 million paid by a Russian billionaire for a Trump-owned estate in Florida and $12.2 million in payments in connection with holding the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013. </p>
